The present invention provides beta xylosidase variant enzymes suitable for use in saccharification reactions. The present application further provides genetically modified fungal organisms that produce beta xylosidase variants as well as enzyme mixtures exhibiting enhanced hydrolysis of cellulosic material to fermentable sugars enzyme mixtures produced by the genetically modified fungal organisms and methods for producing fermentable sugars from cellulose using such enzyme mixtures.

Interest has arisen in fermentation of carbohydrate rich biomass to provide alternatives to petrochemical sources for fuels and organic chemical precursors. There is great interest in using lignocellulosic feedstocks where the plant cellulose is broken down to sugars and subsequently converted to desired end products such as organic chemical precursors. Lignocellulosic biomass is primarily composed of cellulose hemicelluloses and lignin. Cellulose and hemicellulose can be hydrolyzed in a saccharification process to sugars that can be subsequently converted to various products via fermentation. The major fermentable sugars obtained from lignocelluloses are glucose and xylose. For economical product yields a process that can effectively convert all the major sugars present in cellulosic feedstock would be highly desirable.

The present invention provides beta xylosidase variant enzymes suitable for use in saccharification reactions. The present application further provides genetically modified fungal organisms that produce beta xylosidase variants as well as enzyme mixtures exhibiting enhanced hydrolysis of cellulosic material to fermentable sugars enzyme mixtures produced by the genetically modified fungal organisms and methods for producing fermentable sugars from cellulose using such enzyme mixtures.

In some embodiments recombinant cells express genes that are not found in identical form within the native i.e. non recombinant form of the cell and or express native genes that are otherwise abnormally overexpressed under expressed and or not expressed at all due to deliberate human intervention. As used herein recombinant cells as well as recombinant host cells recombinant microorganisms and recombinant fungal cells contain at least one recombinant polynucleotide or polypeptide.

As used herein recombinant used in reference to a cell or vector refers to a cell or vector that has been modified by the introduction of a heterologous nucleic acid sequence or that the cell is derived from a cell so modified. Thus for example recombinant cells express genes that are not found in identical form within the native non recombinant form of the cell or express native genes that are otherwise abnormally expressed under expressed or not expressed at all as a result of deliberate human intervention. Thus recombinant or engineered or non naturally occurring when used with reference to a cell nucleic acid or polypeptide refers to a material or a material corresponding to the natural or native form of the material that has been modified in a manner that would not otherwise exist in nature or is identical thereto but produced or derived from synthetic materials and or by manipulation using recombinant techniques. Non limiting examples include among others recombinant cells expressing genes that are not found within the native non recombinant form of the cell or express native genes that are otherwise expressed at a different level. Recombination recombining and generating a recombined nucleic acid generally encompass the assembly of at least two nucleic acid fragments. In some embodiments Recombination recombining and generating a recombined nucleic acid also encompass the assembly of two or more nucleic acid fragments wherein the assembly gives rise to a chimeric gene.

As used herein when used with reference to a nucleic acid or polypeptide the term heterologous refers to a sequence that is not normally expressed and secreted by an organism e.g. a wild type organism . In some embodiments the term encompasses a sequence that comprises two or more subsequences which are not found in the same relationship to each other as normally found in nature or is recombinantly engineered so that its level of expression or physical relationship to other nucleic acids or other molecules in a cell or structure is not normally found in nature. For instance a heterologous nucleic acid is typically recombinantly produced having two or more sequences from unrelated genes arranged in a manner not found in nature e.g. a nucleic acid open reading frame ORF of the invention operatively linked to a promoter sequence inserted into an expression cassette such as a vector .

A nucleic acid construct nucleic acid e.g. a polynucleotide polypeptide or host cell is referred to herein as recombinant when it is non naturally occurring artificial or engineered. The present invention also provides recombinant nucleic acid constructs comprising a beta xylosidase variant polynucleotide sequence that hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to the complement of a polynucleotide which encodes a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 41 43 45 47 49 51 53 and or 55.

Nucleic acids hybridize when they associate typically in solution. Nucleic acids hybridize due to a variety of well characterized physico chemical forces such as hydrogen bonding solvent exclusion base stacking and the like. As used herein the term stringent hybridization wash conditions in the context of nucleic acid hybridization experiments such as Southern and Northern hybridizations are sequence dependent and are different under different environmental parameters. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen 1993 Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Hybridization with Nucleic Acid Probes Part I Chapter 2 Elsevier New York which is incorporated herein by reference. For polynucleotides of at least 100 nucleotides in length low to very high stringency conditions are defined as follows prehybridization and hybridization at 42 C. in 5 SSPE 0.3 SDS 200 g ml sheared and denatured salmon sperm DNA and either 25 formamide for low stringencies 35 formamide for medium and medium high stringencies or 50 formamide for high and very high stringencies following standard Southern blotting procedures. For polynucleotides of at least 100 nucleotides in length the carrier material is finally washed three times each for 15 minutes using 2 SSC 0.2 SDS 50 C. low stringency at 55 C. medium stringency at 60 C. medium high stringency at 65 C. high stringency or at 70 C. very high stringency .

As used herein identity or percent identity in the context of two or more polypeptide sequences refers to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of amino acid residues that are the same e.g. share at least about 70 at least about 75 at least about 80 at least about 85 at least about 88 identity at least about 89 at least about 90 at least about 91 at least about 92 at least about 93 at least about 94 at least about 95 at least about 96 at least about 97 at least about 98 or at least about 99 identity over a specified region to a reference sequence when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a comparison window or designated region as measured using a sequence comparison algorithms or by manual alignment and visual inspection.

In some embodiments the terms percent identity identity percent identical and identical are used interchangeably herein to refer to the percent amino acid or polynucleotide sequence identity that is obtained by ClustalW analysis version W 1.8 available from European Bioinformatics Institute Cambridge UK counting the number of identical matches in the alignment and dividing such number of identical matches by the length of the reference sequence and using the following ClustalW parameters to achieve slow more accurate pairwise optimal alignments DNA Protein Gap Open Penalty 15 10 DNA Protein Gap Extension Penalty 6.66 0.1 Protein weight matrix Gonnet series DNA weight matrix Identity.

As used herein the term comparison window includes reference to a segment of any one of a number of contiguous positions from about 20 to about 464 e.g. about 50 to about 300 contiguous positions about 50 to 250 contiguous positions or also about 100 to about 200 contiguous positions in which a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two sequences are optimally aligned. As noted in some embodiments the comparison is between the entire length of the two sequences or if one sequence is a fragment of the other the entire length of the shorter of the two sequences. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison and determination of sequence identity can be determined by a sequence comparison algorithm or by visual inspection as well known in the art. When optimally aligning sequences and determining sequence identity by visual inspection percent sequence identity is calculated as the number of residues of the test sequence that are identical to the reference sequence divided by the number of non gap positions and multiplied by 100. When using a sequence comparison algorithm test and reference sequences are entered into a computer subsequence coordinates and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identities for the test sequences relative to the reference sequence based on the program parameters.

Two sequences are aligned when they are aligned for similarity scoring using a defined amino acid substitution matrix e.g. BLOSUM62 gap existence penalty and gap extension penalty so as to arrive at the highest score possible for that pair of sequences. Amino acid substitution matrices and their use in quantifying the similarity between two sequences are well known in the art See e.g. Dayhoff et al. in Dayhoff ed. Vol. 5 Suppl. 3 Natl. Biomed. Res. Round. Washington D.C. 1978 pp. 345 352 and Henikoff et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 10915 10919 1992 both of which are incorporated herein by reference . The BLOSUM62 matrix is often used as a default scoring substitution matrix in sequence alignment protocols such as Gapped BLAST 2.0. The gap existence penalty is imposed for the introduction of a single amino acid gap in one of the aligned sequences and the gap extension penalty is imposed for each additional empty amino acid position inserted into an already opened gap. The alignment is defined by the amino acid position of each sequence at which the alignment begins and ends and optionally by the insertion of a gap or multiple gaps in one or both sequences so as to arrive at the highest possible score. While optimal alignment and scoring can be accomplished manually the process is facilitated by the use of a computer implemented alignment algorithm e.g. gapped BLAST 2.0 See Altschul et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 25 3389 3402 1997 which is incorporated herein by reference and made available to the public at the National Center for Biotechnology Information Website . Optimal alignments including multiple alignments can be prepared using readily available programs such as PSI BLAST See e.g. Altschul et al. supra .

The present invention also provides a recombinant nucleic acid construct comprising at least one beta xylosidase variant polynucleotide sequence that hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to the complement of a polynucleotide which encodes a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 41 43 45 47 49 51 53 and or 55 wherein the polypeptide is capable of catalyzing the degradation of cellulose.

Two nucleic acid or polypeptide sequences that have 100 sequence identity are said to be identical. A nucleic acid or polypeptide sequence are said to have substantial sequence identity to a reference sequence when the sequences have at least about 70 at least about 75 at least about 80 at least about 85 at least about 90 at least about 91 at least about 92 at least about 93 at least about 94 at least about 95 at least about 96 at least about 97 at least about 98 or at least about 99 or greater sequence identity as determined using the methods described herein such as BLAST using standard parameters.

As used herein the term operably linked refers to a configuration in which a control sequence is appropriately placed at a position relative to the coding sequence of the DNA sequence such that the control sequence influences the expression of a polypeptide.

As used herein an amino acid or nucleotide sequence e.g. a promoter sequence signal peptide terminator sequence etc. is heterologous to another sequence with which it is operably linked if the two sequences are not associated in nature.

As used herein the terms host cell and host strain refer to suitable hosts for expression vectors comprising DNA provided herein. In some embodiments the host cells are prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells that have been transformed or transfected with vectors constructed using recombinant DNA techniques as known in the art. Transformed hosts are capable of either replicating vectors encoding at least one protein of interest and or expressing the desired protein of interest. In addition reference to a cell of a particular strain refers to a parental cell of the strain as well as progeny and genetically modified derivatives. Genetically modified derivatives of a parental cell include progeny cells that contain a modified genome or episomal plasmids that confer for example antibiotic resistance improved fermentation etc. In some embodiments host cells are genetically modified to have characteristics that improve protein secretion protein stability or other properties desirable for expression and or secretion of a protein. For example knockout of Alp1 function results in a cell that is protease deficient. Knockout of pyr5 function results in a cell with a pyrimidine deficient phenotype. In some embodiments host cells are modified to delete endogenous cellulase protein encoding sequences or otherwise eliminate expression of one or more endogenous cellulases. In some embodiments expression of one or more endogenous cellulases is inhibited to increase production of cellulases of interest. Genetic modification can be achieved by any suitable genetic engineering techniques and or classical microbiological techniques e.g. chemical or UV mutagenesis and subsequent selection . Using recombinant technology nucleic acid molecules can be introduced deleted inhibited or modified in a manner that results in increased yields of beta xylosidase variant s within the organism or in the culture. For example knockout of Alp1 function results in a cell that is protease deficient. Knockout of pyr5 function results in a cell with a pyrimidine deficient phenotype. In some genetic engineering approaches homologous recombination is used to induce targeted gene modifications by specifically targeting a gene in vivo to suppress expression of the encoded protein. In an alternative approach siRNA antisense and or ribozyme technology finds use in inhibiting gene expression.

As used herein the term introduced used in the context of inserting a nucleic acid sequence into a cell means transformation transduction conjugation transfection and or any other suitable method s known in the art for inserting nucleic acid sequences into host cells. Any suitable means for the introduction of nucleic acid into host cells find use in the present invention.

As used herein the terms transformed and transformation used in reference to a cell refer to a cell that has a non native nucleic acid sequence integrated into its genome or has an episomal plasmid that is maintained through multiple generations.

As used herein the terms improved thermoactivity and increased thermoactivity refer to an enzyme e.g. a test enzyme of interest displaying an increase relative to a reference enzyme in the amount of enzymatic activity e.g. substrate hydrolysis in a specified time under specified reaction conditions for example elevated temperature.

As used herein the terms improved thermostability and increased thermostability refer to an enzyme e.g. a test enzyme of interest displaying an increase in residual activity relative to a reference enzyme. Residual activity is determined by 1 exposing the test enzyme or reference enzyme to stress conditions of elevated temperature optionally at lowered pH for a period of time and then determining beta xylosidase activity 2 exposing the test enzyme or reference enzyme to unstressed conditions for the same period of time and then determining beta xylosidase activity and 3 calculating residual activity as the ratio of activity obtained under stress conditions 1 over the activity obtained under unstressed conditions 2 . For example the beta xylosidase activity of the enzyme exposed to stress conditions a is compared to that of a control in which the enzyme is not exposed to the stress conditions b and residual activity is equal to the ratio a b. A test enzyme with increased thermostability will have greater residual activity than the reference enzyme. In some embodiments the enzymes are exposed to stress conditions of 55 C. at pH 5.0 for 1 hr but other cultivation conditions can be used.

As used herein the term culturing refers to growing a population of microbial cells under suitable conditions in a liquid or solid medium.

As used herein the term saccharification refers to the process in which substrates e.g. cellulosic biomass are broken down via the action of cellulases to produce fermentable sugars e.g. monosaccharides such as but not limited to glucose .

As used herein the term fermentable sugars refers to simple sugars e.g. monosaccharides disaccharides and short oligosaccharides including but not limited to glucose xylose galactose arabinose mannose and sucrose. Indeed a fermentable sugar is any sugar that a microorganism can utilize or ferment.

As used herein the term soluble sugars refers to water soluble hexose monomers and oligomers of up to about six monomer units.

As used herein the term fermentation is used broadly to refer to the cultivation of a microorganism or a culture of microorganisms that use simple sugars such as fermentable sugars as an energy source to obtain a desired product.

As used herein the term feedstock refers to any material that is suitable for use in production of an end product. It is intended that the term encompass any material suitable for use in saccharification reactions. In some embodiments the term encompasses material obtained from nature that is in an unprocessed or minimally processed state although it is not intended that the term be limited to these embodiments. In some embodiments the term encompasses biomass and biomass substrates comprising any suitable compositions for use in production of fermentable sugars. In some embodiments the feedstock is pre treated before and or while it is being used as a substrate in a saccharification reaction.

The terms biomass and biomass substrate encompass any suitable materials for use in saccharification reactions. The terms encompass but are not limited to materials that comprise cellulose i.e. cellulosic biomass cellulosic feedstock and cellulosic substrate . Biomass can be derived from plants animals or microorganisms and may include but is not limited to agricultural industrial and forestry residues industrial and municipal wastes and terrestrial and aquatic crops grown for energy purposes. Examples of biomass substrates include but are not limited to wood wood pulp paper pulp corn fiber corn grain corn cobs crop residues such as corn husks corn stover grasses wheat wheat straw barley barley straw hay rice rice straw switchgrass waste paper paper and pulp processing waste woody or herbaceous plants fruit or vegetable pulp distillers grain grasses rice hulls cotton hemp flax sisal sugar cane bagasse sorghum soy switchgrass components obtained from milling of grains trees branches roots leaves tops wood chips sawdust shrubs bushes seed pods vegetables fruits and flowers and any suitable mixtures thereof. In some embodiments the biomass comprises but is not limited to cultivated crops e.g. grasses including C4 grasses such as switch grass cord grass rye grass miscanthus reed canary grass or any combination thereof sugar processing residues for example but not limited to bagasse e.g. sugar cane bagasse beet pulp e.g. sugar beet or a combination thereof agricultural residues e.g. soybean stover corn stover corn fiber rice straw sugar cane straw rice rice hulls barley straw corn cobs wheat straw canola straw oat straw oat hulls corn fiber hemp flax sisal cotton tops stems leaves seed pods fruit pods or any combination thereof fruit pulp vegetable pulp distillers grains forestry biomass e.g. wood wood pulp paper pulp recycled wood pulp fiber sawdust hardwood such as aspen wood softwood or a combination thereof . Furthermore in some embodiments the biomass comprises cellulosic waste material and or forestry waste materials including but not limited to paper and pulp processing waste municipal paper waste newsprint cardboard and the like. In some embodiments biomass comprises one species of fiber while in some alternative embodiments the biomass comprises a mixture of fibers that originate from different biomasses. In some embodiments the biomass may also comprise transgenic plants that express ligninase and or cellulase enzymes See e.g. US 2008 0104724 A1 .

A biomass substrate is said to be pretreated when it has been processed by some physical and or chemical means to facilitate saccharification. As described further herein in some embodiments the biomass substrate is pretreated or treated using methods known in the art such as chemical pretreatment e.g. ammonia pretreatment dilute acid pretreatment dilute alkali pretreatment or solvent exposure physical pretreatment e.g. steam explosion or irradiation mechanical pretreatment e.g. grinding or milling and biological pretreatment e.g. application of lignin solubilizing microorganisms and combinations thereof to increase the susceptibility of cellulose to hydrolysis. Thus the term biomass encompasses any living or dead biological material that contains a polysaccharide substrate including but not limited to cellulose starch other forms of long chain carbohydrate polymers and mixtures of such sources. It may or may not be assembled entirely or primarily from glucose or xylose and may optionally also contain various other pentose or hexose monomers. Xylose is an aldopentose containing five carbon atoms and an aldehyde group. It is the precursor to hemicellulose and is often a main constituent of biomass. In some embodiments the substrate is slurried prior to pretreatment. In some embodiments the consistency of the slurry is between about 2 and about 30 and more typically between about 4 and about 15 . In some embodiments the slurry is subjected to a water and or acid soaking operation prior to pretreatment. In some embodiments the slurry is dewatered using any suitable method to reduce steam and chemical usage prior to pretreatment. Examples of dewatering devices include but are not limited to pressurized screw presses See e.g. WO 2010 022511 incorporated herein by reference pressurized filters and extruders.

In some embodiments the pretreatment is carried out to hydrolyze hemicellulose and or a portion thereof present in the cellulosic substrate to monomeric pentose and hexose sugars e.g. xylose arabinose mannose galactose and or any combination thereof . In some embodiments the pretreatment is carried out so that nearly complete hydrolysis of the hemicellulose and a small amount of conversion of cellulose to glucose occurs. In some embodiments an acid concentration in the aqueous slurry from about 0.02 w w to about 2 w w or any amount therebetween is typically used for the treatment of the cellulosic substrate. Any suitable acid finds use in these methods including but not limited to hydrochloric acid nitric acid and or sulfuric acid. In some embodiments the acid used during pretreatment is sulfuric acid. Steam explosion is one method of performing acid pretreatment of biomass substrates See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 461 648 . Another method of pretreating the slurry involves continuous pretreatment i.e. the cellulosic biomass is pumped though a reactor continuously . This methods are well known to those skilled in the art See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 7 754 457 .

In some embodiments alkali is used in the pretreatment. In contrast to acid pretreatment pretreatment with alkali may not hydrolyze the hemicellulose component of the biomass. Rather the alkali reacts with acidic groups present on the hemicellulose to open up the surface of the substrate. In some embodiments the addition of alkali alters the crystal structure of the cellulose so that it is more amenable to hydrolysis. Examples of alkali that find use in the pretreatment include but are not limited to ammonia ammonium hydroxide potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide. One method of alkali pretreatment is Ammonia Freeze Explosion Ammonia Fiber Explosion or Ammonia Fiber Expansion AFEX process See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 171 592 5 037 663 4 600 590 6 106 888 4 356 196 5 939 544 6 176 176 5 037 663 and 5 171 592 . During this process the cellulosic substrate is contacted with ammonia or ammonium hydroxide in a pressure vessel for a sufficient time to enable the ammonia or ammonium hydroxide to alter the crystal structure of the cellulose fibers. The pressure is then rapidly reduced which allows the ammonia to flash or boil and explode the cellulose fiber structure. In some embodiments the flashed ammonia is then recovered using methods known in the art. In some alternative methods dilute ammonia pretreatment is utilized. The dilute ammonia pretreatment method utilizes more dilute solutions of ammonia or ammonium hydroxide than AFEX See e.g. WO2009 045651 and US 2007 0031953 . This pretreatment process may or may not produce any monosaccharides.

An additional pretreatment process for use in the present invention includes chemical treatment of the cellulosic substrate with organic solvents in methods such as those utilizing organic liquids in pretreatment systems See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 556 430 incorporated herein by reference . These methods have the advantage that the low boiling point liquids easily can be recovered and reused. Other pretreatments such as the Organosolv process also use organic liquids See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 7 465 791 which is also incorporated herein by reference . Subjecting the substrate to pressurized water may also be a suitable pretreatment method See e.g. Weil et al. 1997 Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 68 1 2 21 40 1997 which is incorporated herein by reference . In some embodiments the pretreated cellulosic biomass is processed after pretreatment by any of several steps such as dilution with water washing with water buffering filtration or centrifugation or any combination of these processes prior to enzymatic hydrolysis as is familiar to those skilled in the art. The pretreatment produces a pretreated feedstock composition e.g. a pretreated feedstock slurry that contains a soluble component including the sugars resulting from hydrolysis of the hemicellulose optionally acetic acid and other inhibitors and solids including unhydrolyzed feedstock and lignin. In some embodiments the soluble components of the pretreated feedstock composition are separated from the solids to produce a soluble fraction. In some embodiments the soluble fraction including the sugars released during pretreatment and other soluble components e.g. inhibitors is then sent to fermentation. However in some embodiments in which the hemicellulose is not effectively hydrolyzed during the pretreatment one or more additional steps are included e.g. a further hydrolysis step s and or enzymatic treatment step s and or further alkali and or acid treatment to produce fermentable sugars. In some embodiments the separation is carried out by washing the pretreated feedstock composition with an aqueous solution to produce a wash stream and a solids stream comprising the unhydrolyzed pretreated feedstock. Alternatively the soluble component is separated from the solids by subjecting the pretreated feedstock composition to a solids liquid separation using any suitable method e.g. centrifugation microfiltration plate and frame filtration cross flow filtration pressure filtration vacuum filtration etc. . Optionally in some embodiments a washing step is incorporated into the solids liquids separation. In some embodiments the separated solids containing cellulose then undergo enzymatic hydrolysis with cellulase enzymes in order to convert the cellulose to glucose. In some embodiments the pretreated feedstock composition is fed into the fermentation process without separation of the solids contained therein. In some embodiments the unhydrolyzed solids are subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis with cellulase enzymes to convert the cellulose to glucose after the fermentation process. In some embodiments the pretreated cellulosic feedstock is subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis with cellulase enzymes.

As used herein the term lignocellulosic biomass refers to any plant biomass comprising cellulose and hemicellulose bound to lignin. In some embodiments the biomass may optionally be pretreated to increase the susceptibility of cellulose to hydrolysis by chemical physical and biological pretreatments such as steam explosion pulping grinding acid hydrolysis solvent exposure and the like as well as combinations thereof . Various lignocellulosic feedstocks find use including those that comprise fresh lignocellulosic feedstock partially dried lignocellulosic feedstock fully dried lignocellulosic feedstock and or any combination thereof. In some embodiments lignocellulosic feedstocks comprise cellulose in an amount greater than about 20 more preferably greater than about 30 more preferably greater than about 40 w w . For example in some embodiments the lignocellulosic material comprises from about 20 to about 90 w w cellulose or any amount therebetween although in some embodiments the lignocellulosic material comprises less than about 19 less than about 18 less than about 17 less than about 16 less than about 15 less than about 14 less than about 13 less than about 12 less than about 11 less than about 10 less than about 9 less than about 8 less than about 7 less than about 6 or less than about 5 cellulose w w . Furthermore in some embodiments the lignocellulosic feedstock comprises lignin in an amount greater than about 10 more typically in an amount greater than about 15 w w . In some embodiments the lignocellulosic feedstock comprises small amounts of sucrose fructose and or starch. The lignocellulosic feedstock is generally first subjected to size reduction by methods including but not limited to milling grinding agitation shredding compression expansion or other types of mechanical action. Size reduction by mechanical action can be performed by any type of equipment adapted for the purpose for example but not limited to hammer mills tub grinders roll presses refiners and hydrapulpers. In some embodiments at least 90 by weight of the particles produced from the size reduction have lengths less than between about 1 16 and about 4 in the measurement may be a volume or a weight average length . In some embodiments the equipment used to reduce the particle size reduction is a hammer mill or shredder. Subsequent to size reduction the feedstock is typically slurried in water as this facilitates pumping of the feedstock. In some embodiments lignocellulosic feedstocks of particle size less than about 6 inches do not require size reduction.

As used herein the term lignocellulosic feedstock refers to any type of lignocellulosic biomass that is suitable for use as feedstock in saccharification reactions.

As used herein the term pretreated lignocellulosic feedstock refers to lignocellulosic feedstocks that have been subjected to physical and or chemical processes to make the fiber more accessible and or receptive to the actions of cellulolytic enzymes as described above.

As used herein the term recovered refers to the harvesting isolating collecting or recovering of protein from a cell and or culture medium. In the context of saccharification it is used in reference to the harvesting of fermentable sugars produced during the saccharification reaction from the culture medium and or cells. In the context of fermentation it is used in reference to harvesting the fermentation product from the culture medium and or cells. Thus a process can be said to comprise recovering a product of a reaction such as a soluble sugar recovered from saccharification if the process includes separating the product from other components of a reaction mixture subsequent to at least some of the product being generated in the reaction.

As used herein the term slurry refers to an aqueous solution in which are dispersed one or more solid components such as a cellulosic substrate.

As used herein increasing the yield of a product such as a fermentable sugar from a reaction occurs when a particular component of interest is present during the reaction e.g. beta xylosidase causes more product to be produced compared with a reaction conducted under the same conditions with the same substrate and other substituents but in the absence of the component of interest e.g. without beta xylosidase .

As used herein a reaction is said to be substantially free of a particular enzyme if the amount of that enzyme compared with other enzymes that participate in catalyzing the reaction is less than about 2 about 1 or about 0.1 wt wt .

As used herein fractionating a liquid e.g. a culture broth means applying a separation process e.g. salt precipitation column chromatography size exclusion and filtration or a combination of such processes to provide a solution in which a desired protein such as beta xylosidase a cellulase enzyme and or a combination thereof comprises a greater percentage of total protein in the solution than in the initial liquid product.

As used herein the term enzymatic hydrolysis refers to a process comprising at least one cellulases and at least one glycosidase enzyme and or a mixture glycosidases that act on polysaccharides e.g. cellulose to convert all or a portion thereof to fermentable sugars. Hydrolyzing cellulose or other polysaccharide occurs when at least some of the glycosidic bonds between two monosaccharides present in the substrate are hydrolyzed thereby detaching from each other the two monomers that were previously bonded.

It is intended that the enzymatic hydrolysis be carried out with any suitable type of cellulase enzymes capable of hydrolyzing the cellulose to glucose regardless of their source including those obtained from fungi such as spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. and as well as those obtained from bacteria of the genera and . Cellulase compositions typically comprise one or more cellobiohydrolase endoglucanase and beta glucosidase enzymes. In some cases the cellulase compositions additionally contain hemicellulases esterases swollenins cips etc. Many of these enzymes are readily commercially available.

Fungi bacteria and other organisms produce a variety of cellulases and other enzymes that act in concert to catalyze decrystallization and hydrolysis of cellulose to yield fermentable sugars. One such fungus is which is described herein. The variant beta xylosidase sequences provided herein are particularly useful for the production of fermentable sugars from cellulosic biomass and other feedstocks.

In some embodiments the variant beta xylosidases of the present invention further comprise additional sequences which do not alter the encoded activity of the enzyme. For example in some embodiments the variant beta xylosidases are linked to an epitope tag or to another sequence useful in purification.

In some embodiments the variant beta xylosidase polypeptides of the present invention are secreted from the host cell in which they are expressed e.g. a yeast or filamentous fungal host cell and are expressed as a pre protein including a signal peptide i.e. an amino acid sequence linked to the amino terminus of a polypeptide and which directs the encoded polypeptide into the cell secretory pathway .

In some embodiments the present invention provides polynucleotides encoding variant beta xylosidase polypeptides and or biologically active fragments thereof as described herein. In some embodiments the polynucleotide is operably linked to one or more heterologous regulatory or control sequences that control gene expression to create a recombinant polynucleotide capable of expressing the polypeptide. In some embodiments expression constructs containing a heterologous polynucleotide encoding a variant beta xylosidase is introduced into appropriate host cells to express the variant beta xylosidase.

Those of ordinary skill in the art understand that due to the degeneracy of the genetic code a multitude of nucleotide sequences encoding variant beta xylosidase polypeptides of the present invention exist. For example the codons AGA AGG CGA CGC CGG and CGU all encode the amino acid arginine. Thus at every position in the nucleic acids of the invention where an arginine is specified by a codon the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described above without altering the encoded polypeptide. It is understood that U in an RNA sequence corresponds to T in a DNA sequence. The invention contemplates and provides each and every possible variation of nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide of the invention that could be made by selecting combinations based on possible codon choices.

A DNA sequence may also be designed for high codon usage bias codons codons that are used at higher frequency in the protein coding regions than other codons that code for the same amino acid . The preferred codons may be determined in relation to codon usage in a single gene a set of genes of common function or origin highly expressed genes the codon frequency in the aggregate protein coding regions of the whole organism codon frequency in the aggregate protein coding regions of related organisms or combinations thereof. A codon whose frequency increases with the level of gene expression is typically an optimal codon for expression. In particular a DNA sequence can be optimized for expression in a particular host organism. A variety of methods are well known in the art for determining the codon frequency e.g. codon usage relative synonymous codon usage and codon preference in specific organisms including multivariate analysis e.g. using cluster analysis or correspondence analysis and the effective number of codons used in a gene. The data source for obtaining codon usage may rely on any available nucleotide sequence capable of coding for a protein. These data sets include nucleic acid sequences actually known to encode expressed proteins e.g. complete protein coding sequences CDS expressed sequence tags ESTs or predicted coding regions of genomic sequences as is well known in the art. Polynucleotides encoding variant beta xylosidases can be prepared using any suitable methods known in the art. Typically oligonucleotides are individually synthesized then joined e.g. by enzymatic or chemical ligation methods or polymerase mediated methods to form essentially any desired continuous sequence. In some embodiments polynucleotides of the present invention are prepared by chemical synthesis using any suitable methods known in the art including but not limited to automated synthetic methods. For example in the phosphoramidite method oligonucleotides are synthesized e.g. in an automatic DNA synthesizer purified annealed ligated and cloned in appropriate vectors. In some embodiments double stranded DNA fragments are then obtained either by synthesizing the complementary strand and annealing the strands together under appropriate conditions or by adding the complementary strand using DNA polymerase with an appropriate primer sequence. There are numerous general and standard texts that provide methods useful in the present invention are well known to those skilled in the art.

Methods for recombinant expression of proteins in fungi and other organisms are well known in the art and a number expression vectors are available or can be constructed using routine methods. In some embodiments nucleic acid constructs of the present invention comprise a vector such as a plasmid a cosmid a phage a virus a bacterial artificial chromosome BAC a yeast artificial chromosome YAC and the like into which a nucleic acid sequence of the invention has been inserted. In some embodiments polynucleotides of the present invention are incorporated into any one of a variety of expression vectors suitable for expressing variant beta xylosidase polypeptide s . Suitable vectors include but are not limited to chromosomal nonchromosomal and synthetic DNA sequences e.g. derivatives of SV40 as well as bacterial plasmids phage DNA baculovirus yeast plasmids vectors derived from combinations of plasmids and phage DNA viral DNA such as vaccinia adenovirus fowl pox virus pseudorabies adenovirus adeno associated virus retroviruses and many others. Any suitable vector that transduces genetic material into a cell and if replication is desired which is replicable and viable in the relevant host finds use in the present invention. In some embodiments the construct further comprises regulatory sequences including but not limited to a promoter operably linked to the protein encoding sequence. Large numbers of suitable vectors and promoters are known to those of skill in the art. Indeed in some embodiments in order to obtain high levels of expression in a particular host it is often useful to express the variant beta xylosidases of the present invention under the control of a heterologous promoter. In some embodiments a promoter sequence is operably linked to the 5 region of the variant beta xylosidase coding sequence using any suitable method known in the art. Examples of useful promoters for expression of variant beta xylosidases include but are not limited to promoters from fungi. In some embodiments a promoter sequence that drives expression of a gene other than a beta xylosidase gene in a fungal strain finds use. As a non limiting example a fungal promoter from a gene encoding an endoglucanase may be used. In some embodiments a promoter sequence that drives the expression of a beta xylosidase gene in a fungal strain other than the fungal strain from which the beta xylosidases were derived finds use.

In some embodiments host cells are genetically modified to have characteristics that improve protein secretion protein stability and or other properties desirable for expression and or secretion of a protein. For example knockout of Alp1 function results in a cell that is protease deficient. Knockout of pyr5 function results in a cell with a pyrimidine deficient phenotype. In some embodiments the host cells are modified to delete endogenous cellulase protein encoding sequences or otherwise eliminate expression of one or more endogenous cellulases. In some embodiments expression of one or more endogenous cellulases is inhibited to increase production of cellulases of interest. Genetic modification can be achieved by genetic engineering techniques and or classical microbiological techniques e.g. chemical or UV mutagenesis and subsequent selection .

Arch Micriobiol. 191 615 622 2009 all of which are incorporated by reference herein . Random mutagenesis followed by screening for desired mutations also finds use See e.g. Combier et al. FEMS Microbiol Lett 220 141 8 2003 and Firon et al. Eukary. Cell 2 247 55 2003 both of which are incorporated by reference . In some embodiments the host cell is modified to reduce production of endogenous cellobiose dehydrogenases. In some embodiments the cell is modified to reduce production of cellobiose dehydrogenase e.g. CDH1 or CDH2 . In some embodiments the host cell has less than 75 sometimes less than 50 sometimes less than 30 sometimes less than 25 sometimes less than 20 sometimes less than 15 sometimes less than 10 sometimes less than 5 and sometimes less than 1 of the cellobiose dehydrogenase e.g. CDH1 and or CDH2 activity of the corresponding cell in which the gene is not disrupted.

In some embodiments cells expressing the variant beta xylosidase polypeptides of the invention are grown under batch or continuous fermentations conditions. Classical batch fermentation is a closed system wherein the compositions of the medium is set at the beginning of the fermentation and is not subject to artificial alternations during the fermentation. A variation of the batch system is a fed batch fermentation which also finds use in the present invention. In this variation the substrate is added in increments as the fermentation progresses. Fed batch systems are useful when catabolite repression is likely to inhibit the metabolism of the cells and where it is desirable to have limited amounts of substrate in the medium. Batch and fed batch fermentations are common and well known in the art.

Continuous fermentation systems strive to maintain steady state growth conditions. Methods for modulating nutrients and growth factors for continuous fermentation processes as well as techniques for maximizing the rate of product formation are well known in the art of industrial microbiology.

After 24 hours the reaction mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 4000 rpm 4 C. and 100 l was transferred into 100 l of water in a round bottom 96 well plate. The plate was mixed gently then centrifuged for 1 min and subjected to sugar analysis using standard HPLC methods known in the art.

The beneficial mutations for stability and or activity found in a set of variants are shown in Table 2 2. The improvements are shown in comparison with wild type beta xylosidase.

The beta xylosidase variants were analyzed using various assays such as those described below. In addition some of the thermostable variants were sequenced as described below.

To assess the thermostability of beta xylosidase variants expressed in CF 410 broth supernatants were diluted 1 9 in 100 mM MES pH 6.0 and heated to either 22 C. or 55 C. for 20 h. Samples were diluted 1 1 with water and 10 uL of diluted sample was added to 90 ul of 5 mM pNPX in 100 mM MES pH 6.0. Samples were incubated for 15 minutes at 37 C. quenched with 150 uL of 1 M NaCO and absorbance was measured at 400 nm. The results are shown in the graph presented in . The best variants lie above the diagonal defined by the positive control.

Assessment of the thermoactivity of the best variants on xylose oligosaccharides was performed. Reactions were set up containing 10 mg ml xylooligosaccharides 100 mM sodium acetate pH 6.0 and 1 CF 410 supernatant from the best strains. Reactions were incubated at 37 C. or 57 C. for 4 h heated to 95 C. for 5 minutes to inactivate the enzymes and then analyzed by HPLC using standard methods known in the art. The results are shown in .

The corresponding plasmid samples transformed into CF 410 that produced heat stable xylosidase activities were sequenced. Briefly the gene encoding the wild type beta xylosidase were PCR amplified from the plasmid templates using the following oligos 5 tgtgctgatcctcttccgtcatgaaggcctctgtatcatgcct SEQ ID NO 131 and 5 gaggttcgtttacttacttattacctgtgcctccccctggc SEQ ID NO 132 . Each PCR reaction was set up using 16.8 ul water 5 ul of 5 Kapa buffer B Kappa Biosystems 0.5 ul of dNTP CleanAmp 7 deaza dGTP mix TriLink 1.25 ul of each oligo indicated above 20 M stock concentration 1 ul of plasmid DNA and 0.2 ul of Kapa 2G robust hot start polymerase Kapa Biosystems . Thermocycler conditions were 95 C. 3 cycles of 95 C. 30 72 C. 2 with a final extension at 72 C. 5 . After the PCR reaction was completed 8 ul of ExoSAP IT USB was added into each sample and incubated at 37 C. for 20 minutes followed by enzyme denaturation at 80 C. for 15 minutes. The oligonucleotides shown in Table 2 3 were used to sequence the variants. Ten variants were sequenced and the amino acid modifications are shown in Table 2 6 as compared with the wild type .
