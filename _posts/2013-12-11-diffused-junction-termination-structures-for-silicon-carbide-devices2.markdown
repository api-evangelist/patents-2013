This is a divisional application of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 719 497 filed Mar. 8 2010 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 637 386 which claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 177 372 filed May 12 2009 the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. DAAL01 97 C 0108 awarded by Army Research Laboratories. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates microelectronic devices and more particularly to edge termination for silicon carbide devices.

High voltage silicon carbide SiC devices can be capable of handling high voltages and may handle as much as about 100 amps or more of current depending on the size of their active area. High voltage SiC devices have a number of important applications particularly in the field of power conditioning distribution and control.

A conventional power device structure has an n type SiC substrate on which an n epitaxial layer which functions as a drift region is formed. The device typically includes a P N and or Schottky junction on the n layer which acts as a main junction for blocking voltage in the reverse bias direction and providing current flow in the forward bias direction. A p type junction termination extension JTE region which is typically formed by ion implantation may surround the main junction. The implants used to form the JTE region may be aluminum boron or any other suitable p type dopant. The purpose of the JTE region is to reduce or prevent the electric field crowding at the edges and to reduce or prevent the depletion region from interacting with the surface of the device. Surface effects may cause the depletion region to spread unevenly which may adversely affect the breakdown voltage of the device. Other termination techniques include guard rings and floating field rings that may be more strongly influenced by surface effects. A channel stop region may also be formed by implantation of n type dopants such as nitrogen or phosphorus in order to prevent reduce extension of the depletion region to the edge of the device.

Additional conventional terminations of SiC Schottky diodes are described in Planar Terminations in 4H SiC Schottky Diodes With Low Leakage And High Yields by Singh et al. ISPSD 97 pp. 157 160. A p type epitaxy guard ring termination for a SiC Schottky Barrier Diode is described in The Guard Ring Termination for High Voltage SiC Schottky Barrier Diodes by Ueno et al. IEEE Electron Device Letters Vol. 16 No. 7 July 1995 pp. 331 332. Additionally other termination techniques are described in published PCT Application No. WO 97 08754 entitled SiC Semiconductor Device Comprising A PN Junction With A Voltage Absorbing Edge. 

In addition to junction termination extension JTE multiple floating guard rings MFGR and field plates FP are commonly used termination schemes in high voltage silicon carbide devices. Another conventional edge termination technique is a mesa edge termination.

Field plate termination is also a conventional technique for edge termination of a device and may be cost effective. In conventional field plate devices high fields are supported by the oxide layer under the metal field plate. This technique performs well for silicon devices where the highest field in the semiconductor is relatively low. However in SiC devices the electric fields in the blocking state may be very high 2 MV cm which multiplies by a factor of 2.5 at the oxide semiconductor interface. This leads to very high oxide fields and may result in long term reliability problems. Thus field plate terminations may be unsuitable for use in SiC devices.

The use of multiple floating guard rings in addition to JTE has been proposed as a technique for reducing the sensitivity of the JTE to implant dose variation. See Kinoshita et al. Guard Ring Assisted RESURF A New Termination Structure Providing Stable and High Breakdown Voltage for SiC Power Devices Tech. Digest of ISPSD 02 pp. 253 256. Kinoshita et al. reported that such techniques reduced the sensitivity to implant dose variation. However the area utilized for termination was increased to almost three times the area of JTE alone as the guard rings are added to both the inner edge of the JTE and the outside of the JTE.

A conventional JTE terminated PIN diode is illustrated in . As shown therein a PIN diode includes an n drift layer between a p layer and an n substrate . illustrates one half of a PIN structure the structure may include mirror image portions not shown . An anode contact is on the p layer and a cathode contact is on the n substrate . A junction termination extension JTE region including a plurality of JTE zones A B C is provided in the n drift layer adjacent the p layer . The JTE zones A B C are p type regions that may have levels of charge that decrease outwardly in a stepwise fashion with distance from the PN junction between the p layer and the n drift layer . Although three JTE zones A B C are illustrated more or fewer JTE zones may be provided.

The JTE zones A B C may be formed by successive implantation of ions into the n drift layer . However such implantation may require multiple mask and implantation steps increasing the complexity and expense of production. This may be exacerbated as the number of JTE zones is increased. Furthermore the stepwise doping gradient provided by such an approach may not provide an ideal termination.

Some embodiments provide methods of forming a junction termination extension for an electronic device including a main junction region. The methods include forming a mask on a semiconductor layer adjacent the main junction region the semiconductor layer having a first conductivity type and the mask including a plurality of openings.

In some embodiments Ld may vary from about 2.5 m to about 1 m. Furthermore Lnd may be about 2 m.

The mask may include a plurality of zones including a first zone closest to the main junction region and a second zone that is farther from the main junction region from the first zone. In the first zone the spacing Lnd between adjacent openings may remain constant with distance from the main junction region and the lateral width Ld of the openings may decrease with distance from the main junction region. In the second zone the spacing Lnd between adjacent openings may increase with distance from the main junction region and the lateral width Ld may remain constant with distance from the main junction region.

The mask may include a third zone that is farther from the main junction than the second zone and in the third zone the lateral width Ld of the openings may remain constant with distance from the main junction and the spacing Lnd between adjacent openings increases by an increasing amount with distance from the main junction region.

An electronic device according to some embodiments includes a silicon carbide layer having a first conductivity type and including a main junction adjacent a surface of the silicon carbide layer and a junction termination region at the surface of the silicon carbide layer adjacent the main junction. The charge in the junction termination region decreases with lateral distance from the main junction and a charge in the junction termination region may be less than about 2 10cm.

The junction termination region may have a lateral width L. In some embodiments a maximum charge in the junction termination region may be less than about 1 10cm. A maximum doping concentration in the junction termination region may be about 5 10cm.

The electronic device may further include a semiconductor mesa at a surface of the silicon carbide layer and the junction termination region may be adjacent the semiconductor mesa.

A charge in the junction termination region near a surface of the silicon carbide layer may decrease laterally in a smooth fashion from the maximum charge near the main junction down to about 5 10cm.

An electronic device according to further embodiments includes a silicon carbide layer having a first conductivity type and including a main junction adjacent a surface of the silicon carbide layer. A junction termination region is at a surface of the silicon carbide layer adjacent the main junction.

This invention may however be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.

It will be understood that although the terms first second etc. may be used herein to describe various elements these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example a first element could be termed a second element and similarly a second element could be termed a first element without departing from the scope of the present invention. As used herein the term and or includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.

The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein the singular forms a an and the are intended to include the plural forms as well unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms comprises comprising includes and or including when used herein specify the presence of stated features integers steps operations elements and or components but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features integers steps operations elements components and or groups thereof.

It will be further understood that terms used herein should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of this specification and the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.

It will be understood that when an element such as a layer region or substrate is referred to as being on or extending onto another element it can be directly on or extend directly onto the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast when an element is referred to as being directly on or extending directly onto another element there are no intervening elements present.

Relative terms such as below above upper lower horizontal lateral vertical beneath over etc. may be used herein to describe a relationship of one element layer or region to another element layer or region as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that these terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures.

Embodiments of the invention are described herein with reference to cross section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments and intermediate structures of the invention. The thickness of layers and regions in the drawings may be exaggerated for clarity. Additionally variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result for example of manufacturing techniques and or tolerances are to be expected. Thus embodiments of the invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result for example from manufacturing. For example an implanted region illustrated as a rectangle will typically have rounded or curved features and or a gradient of implant concentration at its edges rather than a discrete change from implanted to non implanted region. Likewise a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation takes place. Thus the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

Some embodiments of the invention are described with reference to semiconductor layers and or regions which are characterized as having a conductivity type such as n type or p type which refers to the majority carrier concentration in the layer and or region. Thus n type material has a majority equilibrium concentration of negatively charged electrons while p type material has a majority equilibrium concentration of positively charged holes. Some material may be designated with a or as in n n p p n n p p or the like to indicate a relatively larger or smaller concentration of majority carriers compared to another layer or region. However such notation does not imply the existence of a particular concentration of majority or minority carriers in a layer or region.

As is described in more detail below embodiments of the present invention may provide improved edge termination of semiconductor devices such as P N Schottky PiN or other such semiconductor devices. Particular embodiments of the present invention provide edge termination for silicon carbide SiC devices. For example embodiments of the present invention may be utilized as edge termination for SiC Schottky diodes junction barrier Schottky JBS diodes PiN diodes thyristors transistors or other such SiC devices.

According to some embodiments a junction termination extension that has a smoothly graded doping profile in both lateral and vertical directions can be provided in a silicon carbide device by controlled diffusion of dopants. As used herein a smoothly graded doping profile refers to a doping profile that is graded in a non stepwise fashion so that it is not characterized by having sharp changes in doping concentration. A smoothly graded doping profile may for example be graded in a linear quasi linear and or log linear fashion.

The dopants may be provided adjacent a main or primary junction in a silicon carbide layer by diffusion or implantation through a plurality of openings in a mask formed on the silicon carbide layer. The openings may be formed to expose portions of the silicon carbide layer that have areas that decrease with distance from the junction. The silicon carbide layer may be annealed to cause the dopants introduced through the plurality of openings to diffuse out and form a single doped JTE region within the silicon carbide layer. Stated differently doped regions in the silicon carbide layer corresponding to the mask openings are expanded by controlled diffusion so that they coalesce to form a single junction termination region that has a doping concentration that may be smoothly graded and in some cases linearly or nearly linearly graded in the vertical and or lateral directions. In particular embodiments the JTE can extend a distance Lof about 200 m or more from a main junction area with a linearly graded doping profile that decreases laterally with distance from the main junction from about 5 10cmnear the main junction down to about 5 10cmassuming a JTE depth of 0.5 m. Such a device may have superior junction termination characteristics compared to a conventional implanted JTE which may require multiple masks for implantation and may not be able to obtain a linearly graded doping profile in a lateral dimension.

Exemplary embodiments are illustrated in . Referring to an n silicon carbide drift layer is formed on an n silicon carbide substrate . The substrate may include on or off axis silicon carbide of the 4H 6H 3C and or 15R polytype. A graphite mask including mask openings and A to E is formed on a surface of the drift layer . The mask opening corresponds to the location of a main junction of the device. For example in a PIN device the main junction would correspond to the PN junction through which a majority of conduction occurs in the forward operating state. It will be appreciated that in some devices such as Schottky diodes the main junction may include a metal semiconductor junction instead of or in addition to a P N junction.

The mask openings A to E are located adjacent to the main junction and are formed to expose areas of the surface of the drift layer that decrease with lateral distance from the main junction. That is the mask openings A to E that are closer to the main junction may be wider and or spaced closer together than mask openings A to E that are farther away from the main junction which may be smaller and or spaced farther apart from one another.

Each of the openings A to E has a first width Ld and is spaced apart from an adjacent opening by a second width Lnd. As illustrated in the first width Ld may decrease with lateral distance from the main junction while the second width Lnd may increase with lateral distance from the main junction.

Referring to in some embodiments p type dopants may be introduced into the drift layer by ion implantation to form doped regions A to E corresponding to the mask openings A to E respectively. The doped regions A to E may have a doping profile in the vertical direction perpendicular to the surface of the drift layer that has a box retrograde or buried profile.

Ions may be implanted into the drift layer to form doped regions A to E that have a sufficient amount of total charge to be diffused to form a desired JTE doping profile in the drift layer during a subsequent thermal drive in anneal. In some embodiments the doped regions A to E may have a peak doping concentration prior to the drive in anneal that is in excess of 10cm. Exemplary implantation conditions that can be employed to obtain a desired amount of charge are shown in Table 1.

Table 1 shows an implant schedule for obtaining a box profile of aluminum ions in 4H SiC having a peak doping concentration of about 1 10cm.

As illustrated in p type dopants may in some embodiments be introduced into the drift layer by diffusion doping. Diffusion doping of silicon carbide is described for example in Y. Gao et al. Selective doping of 4H SiC by codiffusion of aluminum and boron J. of Appl. Phys. col. 90 no. 11 pp. 5647 5651 2001 S. I. Soloviev et al. Doping of 6H SiC by selective diffusion of boron Appl. Phys. Letters vol. 77 no. 4 pp. 4004 4006 2000 and Y. Gao et al. Investigation of boron diffusion in 6H SiC Appl. Phys. Letters vol. 83 no. 5 pp. 905 907 2003 .

Diffusion doping of SiC may have some advantages compared to ion implantation. In particular diffusion doping does not introduce radiation damage to the SiC lattice. Diffusion doping also may be suitable for forming deep linearly graded p n junctions in SiC. Furthermore diffused boron is able to compensate n type doping forming a buried intrinsic layer. However diffusion doping of SiC requires extremely high processing temperatures e.g. above 1800 C. which can cause the SiC substrate being doped to physically degrade. Furthermore it is desirable to establish equilibrium conditions of SiC source materials in the crucible to avoid or discourage either sublimation or epitaxial growth during the sublimation process.

For example in some embodiments a silicon carbide substrate including a silicon carbide drift layer thereon may be exposed to a gas phase source of p type dopants at a pressure of 500 Torr in an argon ambient at temperatures of from about 1800 C. to about 2200 C. for a time of about 5 to 30 minutes. In order to protect the surface of the drift layer the mask may include a graphite film on the surface of the drift layer. The diffusion process may be carried out in some embodiments using an inductively heated vertical quartz chamber with water cooled walls.

Boron and or aluminum vapor can be generated by sublimation from solid sources. For example boron can be sublimated from elemental boron while aluminum can be sublimated from AlC. In particular embodiments boron atoms may be doped into the drift layer and the gas phase source may include 2.5 elemental boron.

In order to sustain the equilibrium condition of the process a graphite crucible with a mixture of silicon carbide powder and elemental boron as a source of the doping atoms may be used with zero temperature gradient between the gas phase and the substrate. Once the equilibrium condition is established inside the crucible the velocity of sublimation and epitaxial growth of SiC on the substrate may be equal and the p type impurities will be diffused into the drift layer . Diffusion of the impurities into the drift layer is believed to be aided by silicon vacancies in the SiC layer.

Unintentional diffusion of boron on the back side of the substrate opposite the drift layer can be removed by lapping the substrate with a diamond paste. Furthermore after diffusion the graphite mask can be removed by burning in an oxygen environment.

Following formation of the doped regions A to E through ion implantation and or diffusion of dopants a drive in anneal is performed to diffuse the dopants into the drift layer to form a graded JTE profile that is relatively smoothly graded from a high doping concentration to a low doping concentration in both the lateral X and vertical Y directions as illustrated in . In some embodiments the doped regions A to B may be annealed at a temperature greater than 1600 C. and in some embodiments greater than 1800 C. The doped regions may be annealed for 5 minutes or more and in some embodiments for 30 minutes or more. In particular embodiments the doped regions A to B may be annealed at a temperature of about 1800 C. for about 30 minutes. A blanket graphite cap layer may be formed on the surface of the drift layer prior to the anneal to protect the surface of the drift layer .

During the drive in anneal process dopants in the doped regions and A to E diffuse further into the drift layer . For example dopants in the doped region diffuse out to form doped region . Similarly dopants in the doped region A diffuse out to form doped region A dopants in the doped region B diffuse out to form doped region B etc. However even after the drive in anneal non diffused dopant concentration peaks A E remain in a near surface region of the drift layer . In particular when the doped regions A to E are formed in a layer of silicon carbide or another semiconductor material in which dopants do not readily diffuse dopant concentration peaks may remain even after the drive in anneal.

The diffused doped regions A to E merge together to form a continuously doped JTE region that has a doping concentration that may decrease smoothly with lateral distance from the main junction as well as with vertical distance from the surface of the drift layer . For example curves and represent curves of relatively constant p type doping concentration in the drift layer . The doping concentration along curve is less than the doping concentration along curve . A PN junction is formed along the contour where the p type doping concentration of the JTE region is equal to the n type doping concentration of the drift layer .

In the case of boron the diffusion coefficient in SiC is 4 to 5 times higher in the lateral direction than in the vertical c axis direction. Thus the lateral diffusion of boron may provide a good overlap or lateral merging of diffused regions in the lateral direction resulting in the formation of larger regions with smaller average doping compared to for example blanket diffusion of dopants. That is in blanket diffusion of dopants i.e. only a single JTE opening is used the dopants may diffuse laterally by a certain distance but the average doping may not decrease significantly as a result of this lateral diffusion. In contrast when multiple JTE openings are used more of the resulting JTE region is doped due to lateral diffusion of dopants resulting in smaller average doping in the JTE region.

Several different doping profiles of p type dopants in 4H SiC as measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry SIMS are illustrated in . In particular FIG. A illustrates four different doping profiles of boron in 4H SiC. Details of the profiles are shown in Table 2.

Referring to the initial charge of boron in the silicon carbide diffusion was determined by the pressure and temperature in the quartz reactor in the case of curves and . In the case of curve the initial charge was provided and precisely controlled by ion implantation and the doped silicon carbide layer was annealed at a temperature of 1800 C. for five minutes in an atmosphere of argon to redistribute and activate the dopants.

As is apparent from the dopant profile extends deeper for higher diffusion temperatures. However the peak concentration of dopants near the surface of the silicon carbide layer remains relatively high in each case. Such a high concentration of dopants may be undesirable in a junction terminal extension because the JTE region may not become fully depleted at the design blocking voltage. However beyond the regions of peak concentration near the surface the dopant concentrations in each case decrease with depth in a generally log linear fashion.

In order to reduce or avoid a problem of less than full depletion at the design blocking voltage a surface portion of the drift layer may be removed for example by selective etching. Referring to an etch mask which may be photoresist is formed on the drift layer over the main junction of the device and the highly doped surface portion of the drift layer is selectively etched away. In some embodiments about 0.2 m of material may be etched from the surface of the drift layer . Selective etching may be performed for example using reactive ion etch techniques which are well known in the art.

A semiconductor mesa is thereby formed to define the main junction of the device that includes the highly doped region while a graded JTE region with a much lower peak concentration of p type dopants is defined because the surface region of the drift layer with a high concentration of p type dopants has been removed. The mesa may have a height of about 0.2 m. The graded JTE region may extend laterally from the mesa by a distance L. The surface doping concentration in the JTE region may be greatest near the main junction of the device and may decrease laterally outward from the junction.

In some embodiments the JTE region may have a maximum concentration of p type dopants that permits the JTE region to be fully depleted at the design blocking voltage. In particular embodiments the JTE region may have a maximum charge of p type dopants that is about 1 10cmor less depending on how much of the drift layer is removed. In further embodiments the JTE region may have a maximum charge of p type dopants that is about 2 10cmor less and in some embodiments about 1 10cmor less. Furthermore the charge of p type dopants in the JTE region may decrease laterally in a smooth fashion from the maximum charge near the main junction down to about 5 10cmat a point distal from the main junction.

In some embodiments the surface doping charge in the JTE region may decrease from about 1 10cmnear the main junction down to about 1 10cmat the outer edge of the JTE region .

In some embodiments the surface doping concentration in the JTE region may decrease from about 5 10cmnear the main junction down to about 10cmat the outer edge of the JTE region . In still further embodiments the surface doping concentration in the JTE region may decrease from about 10cmnear the main junction down to about 10cmat the outer edge of the JTE region .

In some embodiments the JTE region may have a total charge near the main junction of about 2 10cm and in some embodiments a total charge near the main junction of about 5 10cm.

Accordingly a JTE region that has a peak doping concentration that permits the JTE region to be fully depleted at the design blocking voltage and that has a graded dopant profile that decreases in a relatively smooth fashion both laterally and vertically with distance from the main junction can be formed using only a single masking step a single doping step and a single drive in diffusion step.

As noted above in order to provide a JTE region that has a graded doping concentration in both the lateral and vertical directions the amount of charge in the doped regions A E can be reduced with distance from the main junction. For both ion implantation and diffusion doping the amount of charge that is doped into the drift layer can be controlled by varying the size shape spacing and or distribution of the doped regions A E. The size shape spacing and distribution of the doped regions A E is determined by the size shape spacing and or distribution of the mask openings A E shown in . Masks having various patterns of mask openings A E can be used. For example the mask patterns A D shown in include mask openings light areas that expose progressively smaller areas of an underlying drift layer with distance from a main junction.

As illustrated in the mask openings can be any geometric shape such as linear square triangular curvilinear etc. In each case the density and or size of the mask openings can be reduced with distance from the main junction to expose smaller and smaller amounts of the drift layer . In this manner the doped regions in the drift layer corresponding to the mask openings will contain smaller and smaller amounts of total charge assuming that they are doped from the same implantation and or gas phase source.

Referring to in some embodiments the doping mask can include generally linear mask openings . Each of the generally linear mask openings may have a lateral width Ld and may be spaced apart from an adjacent opening by a width Lnd. In some embodiments the doping mask can be organized into a plurality of zones based on distance from the main junction area illustrated in as Zones to . In a given zone the lateral width Ld of the mask openings may decrease with distance from the main junction and or the lateral width Lnd between adjacent mask openings may increase with distance from the main junction area.

For example in the embodiments illustrated in in Zone which in is closest to the main junction area the lateral width Ld of the mask openings decreases with distance from the main junction while Lnd remains constant. In the next zone Zone the lateral width Lnd between adjacent mask openings increases with distance from the main junction while the lateral width Ld of the mask openings remains constant. In Zone the lateral width Lnd between adjacent mask openings increases with distance from the main junction by an increasing amount with each step while the lateral width Ld of the mask openings remains constant and or decreases.

In some particular embodiments in Zone the lateral width Ld of the mask openings may start at 2.5 m close to the junction and may decrease in 0.05 m steps down to 1 m with increasing distance from the main junction while the width Lnd between adjacent mask openings may remain constant at 2 m.

In Zone the lateral width Ld of the mask openings may remain constant at 1 m while the width Lnd between adjacent mask openings may increase in 0.2 m steps with increasing distance from the main junction.

In Zone the lateral width Ld of the mask openings may remain constant at 1 m while the lateral width Lnd between adjacent mask openings increases with distance from the main junction by an amount Lnd that increases with each step. For example in Zone Lnd may increase in steps from 3.6 m to 4.4 m Lnd 0.8 m then from 4.4 M to 5.4 m Lnd 1.0 m then from 5.4 m to 6.6 m Lnd 1.2 m etc. It will be appreciated that although a general pattern as described above may be employed to provide decreasing levels of charge in the JTE region with distance from the main junction there may be some deviations in the pattern while still achieving a generally linearly graded JTE region.

In particular embodiments the mask can be designed to provide a doping profile in the JTE region that decreases with distance from the junction in a linear non linear or nearly linear fashion depending on the doping and or annealing conditions. For example a simulated doping profile that decreases in a quasi linear fashion and that can be generated using a mask pattern as described above is illustrated in . The simulated doping profile shown in is based on an anneal of a doped silicon carbide layer at 1800 C. for 30 minutes.

It will be appreciated that a junction termination extension as described above can be used in connection with many different kinds of unipolar and or bipolar power devices such as metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors MOSFETs insulated gate bipolar transistors IGBTs gate turn off thyristors GTOs bipolar junction transistors BJTs MOS controlled thyristors MCTs PIN diodes Schottky diodes junction barrier Schottky JBS diodes and others. Furthermore a junction termination extension as described above can be used in connection with power devices fabricated using other semiconductor materials. For example a junction termination extension as described herein could be used in connection with power devices fabricated using other wide bandgap semiconductor materials such as gallium nitride based materials or other semiconductor materials such as silicon germanium gallium arsenide etc.
