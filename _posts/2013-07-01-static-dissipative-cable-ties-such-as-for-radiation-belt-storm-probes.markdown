This invention was made with government support under contract number NAS5 01072 awarded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA . The government has certain rights in the invention.

Methods of processing an article formed of a static dissipative ethylene tetrafluoroethylene ETFE resin such an such as to reduce an electrical resistivity and or to increase a tensile strength of the article and ETFE based articles produced in accordance with methods disclosed herein.

Poly ethylene co tetrafluoroethylene commonly referred to as ethylene tetrafluoroethylene or ETFE is a polymer having a relatively high melting temperature relatively high corrosion resistance and strength over a relatively wide temperature range and relatively high electrical and high energy radiation resistance properties. ETFE also tends to have better mechanical toughness and chemical resistance compared to polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE a synthetic fluoropolymer of tetrafluoroethylene such as DuPont Teflon .

ETFE is used in space nuclear and aviation industries for cable ties and wire coatings. ETFE based cable ties tend to have a relatively high strength to weight ratio and relatively low outgassing characteristics.

ETFE also tends to have relatively high volumetric and surface electrical resistivity which may lead to electrical charging or static build up. For example in an extraterrestrial environment elements of a spacecraft or satellite may become electrically charged due to photoelectric effects sunlight and or electron flux. Satellites in geosynchronous orbits are particularly susceptible to electron flux found in outer regions of the outer radiation belt.

Another concern is deep dielectric discharge DDD . In a flux of relatively high energy electrons electrons may penetrate an outer surface of a spacecraft and enter dielectric materials such as circuit boards and coaxial cable insulation.

When the charge build up exceeds a threshold such as a dielectric strength of a material the charge may suddenly discharge to and or through other elements such as electrical circuits and or sensors. This may cause severe and potentially catastrophic damage.

An ETFE resin may include carbon black or other additive to provide a measure of static dissipation. For example a Tefzel HT 2170 fluoropolymer is marketed by E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company of Wilmington Del. U.S.A. as a static dissipating semi conductive resin. According to marketing materials DuPont Tefzel fluoropolymers are melt processible thermoplastics and are part of a family of fluorine based products that include Teflon PTFE Teflon FEP and Teflon PFA fluoropolymers resins.

It has been observed that while a sheet formed of such a static dissipative resin may have an electrical resistivity as low as 1.4 Mega Ohms as measured between points located over approximately 4 inches apart cable ties formed from the resin have been observed to have an electrical resistivity several orders of magnitude greater.

Disclosed herein are methods of processing an article formed of a static dissipative ethylene tetrafluoroethylene ETFE resin such an such as to reduce an electrical resistivity and or to increase a tensile strength of the article and ETFE based articles produced in accordance with methods disclosed herein.

An article formed of a static dissipative ETFE resin may include for example and without limitation a cable strap to wrap support and or secure one or more wires or cables such as a cable tie.

An article formed of a static dissipative ETFE resin may be processed with repeated heating and cooling cycles such as to reduce an electrical resistivity and or to increase a tensile strength of the article.

An upper temperature of a heating and cooling cycle may be within a range of approximately 150 C. and a melting point of the article. The melting point of the article may be in a range of for example approximately 220 C. to 250 C. The upper temperature may be within a range of approximately 180 C. and 200 inclusively.

A lower temperature of a heating and cooling cycle may correspond to an ambient or room temperature which may be approximately 25 C.

An article formed of a static dissipative ETFE resin may be irradiated such as to increase a tensile strength of the article. An ETFE based article may be irradiated to within a range of approximately 5 mega rads Mrads to 10 Mrads inclusively wherein a rad is a measurement of radiation equal to 10 milligrays of radiation.

In the drawings the leftmost digit s of a reference number identifies the drawing in which the reference number first appears.

Disclosed herein are methods of processing articles formed from static dissipative ethylene tetrafluoroethylene ETFE resin such as to improve one or more of electrical conductivity and tensile strength. Such an article may include for example and without limitation a cable strap to wrap support and or secure one or more wires or cables such as a cable tie.

Lock portion further includes a lock mechanism which may include a frangible tab such as illustrated in to lockingly engage features of a first surface of strap portion as strap portion is inserted through lock portion .

Lock portion or portions thereof such as lock mechanism may include and or may be implemented with metal.

Cable tie is an example article having a strap portion to wrap support and or secure one or more wires or cables.

A plurality of cable straps such as cable ties may be used to bundle wires or cables of wires in an electrical assembly or system such as to reduce or eliminate movement of the wires relative to one another and or to guide the wires in accordance with a wire routing plan.

Where the electrical resistivity of a cable strap is relatively significant electrical charge may accumulate on the cable strap until a critical charge level is reached at which point a sudden discharge may occur.

For some environments such as extraterrestrial environments wires or cables may be wrapped with a static dissipative covering such as electrically conductive metal foil and or other electrically conductive material. This may help to reduce or prevent charge buildup on wire insulation and or other dielectric materials. Additionally cable straps formed from a static dissipative resin such as for example and without limitation DuPont Tefzel HT 2170 resin may be utilized.

A cable strap formed of static dissipative EFTE resin may be evaluated with respect to one or more properties including without limitation resistivity tensile strength and outgassing characteristics. One or more such properties may be of relatively critical importance to an application. For example specifications for an extraterrestrial application may include a relatively low resistivity and a relatively high tensile strength. With respect to outgassing an extraterrestrial application may call for a relatively low total mass loss TML and relatively low collected volatile condensable materials CVCM .

As disclosed herein an article formed of a static dissipative ETFE resin may be heat treated such as to reduce an electrical resistivity and or to increase a tensile strength.

As further disclosed herein an article formed of a static dissipative ETFE resin may be irradiated such as to increase tensile strength.

At an article formed of a static dissipative ETFE resin is heated to a temperature within a range of approximately 150 C. and a melting point of the article. The melting point of the article may be in a range of for example approximately 220 C. to 250 C.

At the heating at and the cooling at may be repeated in a cyclical fashion. Subsequent iterations of the heating at and or the cooling at may be performed with respect to one or more other temperatures within the corresponding ranges.

Thermal cycling in accordance with method may reduce electrical resistivity of an article by reducing residual stress in the ETFE polymer of the article. As the polymer chains move or adjust to relieve stress static dissipative and or electrically conductive elements of the ETFE resin which may include carbon black particles may be segregated away from the polymer. This may lead to longer chains of static dissipative or conductive particles and may improve the strength of the polymer. A lower bulk resistivity of the article is measurable. Measured resistivity values of a control group of cable straps and groups of heat treated cable straps are disclosed below with respect to Tables 1 3 4 5 and .

Thermal cycling in accordance with method may increase tensile strength of an article. Measured tensile strengths of control groups of cable straps and groups of heat treated cable straps are disclosed below with respect to Tables 6 and 7.

In heating at and cooling at may end at when an electrical resistivity of the article is lower than an initial electrical resistivity of the article.

Method or portions thereof may be performed in accordance with a thermal cycling profile which may be implemented under control of a computer system. For example and without limitation heating at may include maintaining the article at the heated temperature for a pre determined period of time. Similarly cooling at may include maintaining the article at the cooled temperature for a pre determined period of time.

Heating at may include controlling a heating rate of the article such as by increasing the temperature gradually over a predetermined period of time. Similarly cooling at may include controlling a cooling rate of the article. Controlling of a heating and or cooling rate may include holding the article at one or more intermediate temperatures for a per determined period of time.

Table 1 lists electrical resistivity measurements of a control group of cable ties referred to herein as Group A and formed from DuPont Tefzel HT 2170 static dissipative resin. The resistivity measurements are provided in mega Ohms or M with respect to first second and third resistivity measurements described below with respect to .

A first resistivity measurement corresponds to points and in which may be separated by a distance of approximately 5 to 6 inches. A second resistivity measurement corresponds to points and in which may be separated by a distance of approximately 3 to 4 inches. A third resistivity measurement corresponds to points and in which may be separated by a distance of approximately 3 to 4 inches.

As illustrated in Table 1 average resistivity measurements of cable ties A1 through A10 for the first second and third measurements is 181 M 5 417 M and 1 905 M respectively with corresponding standard deviations of 196 9 316 and 1 536.

A group of ten 10 cable ties identified herein as Group B cable ties B1 through B10 were cyclically heat treated in accordance with a first profile.

Table 6 lists measured tensile strengths of five 5 control groups of cable ties referred to herein as Group A cable ties A1 A7 of Group A and Groups F G H and I all formed from DuPont Tefzel HT 2170 static dissipative resin. Groups A H and I were manufactured from the same lot of resin. Groups A H and I were evaluated at different times and in different ways such as described below.

Tensile strengths of Groups A G and I were measured at ambient or room temperature. Tensile strengths of Groups F and H were observed at an elevated temperature.

Group A cable ties were manufactured in accordance with a well known industry specification TYZ25M SF as 7 long cable ties nominally rated for a tensile strength of 50 pounds.

Group F and G cable ties were manufactured in accordance with a well known industry specification TYZ23M SF which is well known in the art. Group H and I cable ties were manufactured in accordance with a TYZ25M SF specification which is well known in the art.

Tensile strengths of cable tie Groups F G H and I were manufacturer measured in accordance with industry standards.

Tensile strengths of Group A cable ties were measured with a modified version of a specification SAE AS 23190 promulgated by SAE International of Warrendale Pa. U.S.A. as published on Jun. 1 2008. Under the modified version of the specification a crosshead speed of one inch per minute was used with a 1.5 diameter mandrel. The cable ties were pulled to failure and the corresponding failure loads were recorded.

Table 7 lists tensile strengths of two groups of heat treated cable ties Group B and Group C measured in accordance with the modified version of specification SAE AS 23190. Group B includes heat treated cable ties B1 B7. Group C includes heat treated cable ties C1 C7.

Group B and C cable ties were also manufactured in accordance with the industry standard specification TYZ25M SF as 7 long cable ties nominally rated for a tensile strength of 50 pounds.

As can be seen from Table 7 heat treatment in accordance with profile 1 increased tensile strength by 5.6 . Heat treatment in accordance with profile 2 increased tensile strength by 8.5 .

At an article formed of a static dissipative EWE resin is irradiated until a tensile strength of the article is increased.

The article may be irradiated at a radiation rate and for a time sufficient to irradiate the article with a selected or desired amount of radiation. The radiation rate may include for example and without limitation approximately 17 rads second wherein a rad is a measurement of radiation equal to 10 milligrays of radiation. The amount of radiation may be within a range of approximately 5 Mrads to 10 Mrads inclusively.

Table 8 lists tensile strengths of two groups D and E of irradiated cable ties. Group D includes cable ties D1 D5. Group E includes cable ties E1 E10. Table 8 further lists corresponding tensile strength increases relative to control Group A .

Cable tie Groups D and E were irradiated with a Cobalt 60 Gamma irradiator. The cable ties were placed in a nitrogen purged sealed bag to minimize effects of oxygen during testing. The samples were irradiated at a rate of approximately 17.7 rad sec using two 3000 Curie Co 60 Gamma sources at a distance of approximately 200 mm. The gamma rays from Co 60 have an average energy of 1.25 MeV per photon.

Group E cable ties were irradiated to 10 Mrad which may correspond to a maximum expected unshielded irradiation level of a radiation belt storm environment.

As can be seen from Table 8 irradiation to 5 Mrads increased mean tensile strengths by 6.8 . Irradiation to 10 Mrads increased mean tensile strength by 6.4 .

A sample of a static dissipative resin of the type that was used to manufacture the cable ties of Groups A through I was evaluated with respect to thermal vacuum outgassing behavior. The thermal vacuum outgassing was determined in accordance with a ASTM E595 standard titled Standard Test Method for Total Mass Loss and Collected Volatile Condensable Materials from Outgassing in a Vacuum Environment promulgated by ASTM International 100 Barr Harbor Drive PO Box C700 West Conshohocken Pa. 19428 2959.

As specified in ASTM E595 a specimen was exposed to 50 relative humidity at 23 C. for 24 hours. An initial mass of the sample was measured. The sample was then heated to 125 C. in a vacuum of at least 5 10 5 Torr for 24 hours. Some of the outgassed vapor condensed on a separate collector plate. A final weight was then recorded for the sample.

The weight increase of the collector plate was used to determine the collected volatile condensable materials CVCM .

The sample may then be stored for 24 hours at 50 relative humidity and 23 C. After this another weight may be recorded to determine a percentage of water vapor regained WVR .

Specifications for spacecraft materials may specify a TML of less than 1.0 and a CVCM of less than 0.10 . When water vapor contamination is not a concern it may be acceptable to have a TMLWVR of less than 1.0 .

Results of outgassing evaluation of the sample of the static dissipative resin used to manufacture the cable ties of Groups A through I are provided in Table 9.

As can be seen from Table 9 the sample of the static dissipative resin has suitable outgassing TML and CVCM properties for extraterrestrial applications.
