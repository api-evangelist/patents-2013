This invention was made with government support from the National Institute on Drug Abuse under Grant No. PO1 DA08924. The U.S. government has certain rights in this invention.

Mitochondria are essential to cell survival as the main producers of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. However the mitochondria respirator chain is also a major source of oxidative free radicals. For example radical production can occur as a result of the reaction of mitochondrial electron carriers such as ubiquinol with oxygen to form a superoxide. Superoxides react by dismutation to hydrogen peroxide which can decompose to hydroxyl radical. In addition superoxides react with nitric oxide to form peroxynitrite and other reactive oxidants.

Aging is associated not only with increased reactive oxygen species ROS production but also a decrease in the endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms. Mitochondria are particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress because they are continuously exposed to ROS. As a consequence mitochondria decay is often associated with aging.

Free radicals including ROS and reactive nitrogen species RNS produce diverse non specific damage to biological molecules including lipids proteins RNA and DNA. Such damage of these molecules has been implicated in numerous clinical disorders such as atherosclerosis preeclampsia Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease and arthritis.

Antioxidant therapy can potentially delay the aging process and be beneficial in a host of human diseases and conditions such as those described above. However the development of specific mitochondrial therapies has been hampered by the difficulty of delivering antioxidant molecules to mitochondria in vivo. For example the molecule must first be taken up across the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm and then targeted selectively to mitochondria.

None of the currently available antioxidant compounds specifically target mitochondria. The endogenous antioxidants superoxide dismutase and catalase are poorly absorbed orally have short half lives and do not cross the blood brain barrier. The natural antioxidants e.g. Vitamin E coenzyme Q polyphenols are not water soluble and tend to accumulate in cell membranes and only cross the blood brain barrier slowly.

Therefore there is a need for improved methods of reducing oxidative damage with antioxidative compounds that cross cell membranes. In addition it would also be beneficial for the antioxidative compounds to specifically target mitochondria.

These and other objectives have been met by the present invention which provide a method for reducing oxidative damage in a mammal in need thereof. The method comprises administering to the mammal an effective amount of an aromatic cationic peptide.

The method comprises administering to the removed organ an effective amount of an aromatic cationic peptide. The aromatic cationic peptide have a at least one net positive charge b a minimum of three amino acids c a maximum of about twenty amino acids d a relationship between the minimum number of net positive charges p and the total number of amino acid residues r wherein 3pis the largest number that is less than or equal to r 1 e a relationship between the minimum number of aromatic groups a and the total number of net positive charges p wherein 3a is the largest number that is less than or equal to p 1 except that when a is 1 pmay also be 1 and f at least one tyrosine or tryptophan amino acid.

The invention is based on the surprising discovery by the inventors that certain aromatic cationic peptides reduce oxidative damage. Reducing oxidative damage is important since free radicals such as ROS and RNS produce diverse non specific damage to lipids proteins. RNA and DNA oxidative damage caused by free radicals is associated with several diseases and conditions in mammals.

The aromatic cationic peptides useful in the present invention are water soluble and highly polar. Despite these properties the peptides can readily penetrate cell membranes.

The aromatic cationic peptides useful in the present invention include a minimum of three amino acids and preferably include a minimum of four amino acids covalently joined by peptide bonds.

The maximum number of amino acids present in the aromatic cationic peptides of the present invention is about twenty amino acids covalently joined by peptide bonds. Preferably the maximum number of amino acids is about twelve more preferably about nine and most preferably about six. Optimally the number of amino acids present in the peptides is four.

The amino acids of the aromatic cationic peptides useful in the present invention can be any amino acid. As used herein the term amino acid is used to refer to any organic molecule that contains at least one amino group and at least one carboxyl group. Preferably at least one amino group is at the a position relative to the carboxyl group.

The amino acids may be naturally occurring. Naturally occurring amino acids include for example the twenty most common levorotatory L amino acids normally found in mammalian proteins i.e. alanine Ala arginine Arg asparagine Asn aspartic acid Asp cysteine Cys glutamine Glu glutamic acid Glu glycine Gly histidine His isoleucine Ileu leucine Leu lysine Lys methionine Met phenylalanine Phe proline Pro serine Ser threonine Thr trypotophan Trp tyrosine Tyr and valine Val .

Other naturally occurring amino acids include for example amino acids that are synthesized in metabolic processes not associated with protein synthesis. For example the amino acids ornithine and citrulline are synthesized in mammalian metabolism during the production of urea.

The peptides useful in the present invention can contain one or more non naturally occurring amino acids. The non naturally occurring amino acids may be L dextrorotatory D or mixtures thereof. Optimally the peptide has no amino acids that are naturally occurring.

Non naturally occurring amino acids are those amino acids that typically are not synthesized in normal metabolic processes in living organisms and do not naturally occur in proteins. In addition the non naturally occurring amino acids useful in the present invention preferably are also not recognized by common proteases.

The non naturally occurring amino acid can be present at any position in the peptide. For example the non naturally occurring amino acid can be at the N terminus the C terminus or at any position between the N terminus and the C terminus.

The non natural amino acids may for example comprise alkyl aryl or alkylaryl groups. Some examples of alkyl amino acids include aminobutyric acid aminobutyric acid aminobutyric acid aminovaleric acid and aminocaproic acid. Some examples of aryl amino acids include ortho meta and para aminobenzoic acid. Some examples of alkylaryl amino acids include ortho meta and para aminophenyleacetic acid and phenyl aminobutyric acid.

Non naturally occurring amino acids also include derivatives of naturally occurring amino acids. The derivatives of naturally occurring amino acids may for example include the addition of one or more chemical groups to the naturally occurring amino acid.

For example one or more chemical groups can be added to one or more of the 2 3 4 5 or 6 position of the aromatic ring of a phenylalanine or tyrosine residue or the 4 5 6 or 7 position of the benzo ring of a tryptophan residue. The group can be any chemical group that can be added to an aromatic ring. Some examples of such groups include branched or unbranched C Calkyl such as methyl ethyl n propyl isopropyl butyl isobutyl or t butyl C Calkyloxy i.e. alkoxy amino C Calkylamino and C Cdialkylamino e.g. methylamino dimethylamino nitro hydroxyl halo i.e. fluoro chloro bromo or iodo . Some specific examples of non naturally occurring derivatives of naturally occurring amino acids include norvaline Nva norleucine Nle and hydroxyproline Hyp .

Another example of a modification of an amino acid in a peptide useful in the methods of the present invention is the derivatization of a carboxyl group of an aspartic acid or a glutamic acid residue of the peptide. One example of derivatization is amidation with ammonia or with a primary or secondary amine e.g. methylamine ethylamine dimethylamine or diethylamine. Another example of derivatization includes esterification with for example methyl or ethyl alcohol.

Another such modification includes derivatization of an amino group of a lysine arginine or histidine residue. For example such amino groups can be acylated. Some suitable acyl groups include for example a benzoyl group or an alkanoyl group comprising any of the C Calkyl groups mentioned above such as an acetyl or propionyl group.

The non naturally occurring amino acids are preferably resistant and more preferably insensitive to common proteases. Examples of non naturally occurring amino acids that are resistant or insensitive to proteases include the dextrorotatory D form of any of the above mentioned naturally occurring L amino acids as well as L and or D naturally occurring amino acids. The D amino acids do normally occur in proteins although they are found in certain peptide antibiotics that are synthesized by means other than the normal ribosomal protein synthetic machinery of the cell. As used herein the D amino acids are considered to be non naturally occurring amino acids.

In order to minimize protease sensitivity the peptides useful in the methods of the invention should have less than five preferably less than four more preferably less than three and most preferably less than two contiguous L amino acids recognized by common proteases irrespective of whether the amino acids are naturally or non naturally occurring. Optimally the peptide has only D amino acids and no L amino acids.

If the peptide contains protease sensitive sequences of amino acids at least one of the amino acids is preferably a non naturally occurring D amino acid thereby conferring protease resistance. An example of a protease sensitive sequence includes two or more contiguous basic amino acids that are readily cleaved by common proteases such as endopeptidases and trypsin. Examples of basic amino acids include arginine lysine and histidine.

It is important that at least one of the amino acids present in the aromatic cationic peptide is a tyrosine or tryptophan residue or a derivative thereof.

It is also important that the aromatic cationic peptides have a minimum number of net positive charges at physiological pH in comparison to the total number of amino acid residues in the peptide. The minimum number of net positive charges at physiological pH will be referred to below as p . The total number of amino acid residues in the peptide will be referred to below as r .

The minimum number of net positive charges discussed below are all at physiological pH. The term physiological pH as used herein refers to the normal pH in the cells of the tissues and organs of the mammalian body. For instance the physiological pH of a human is normally approximately 7.4 but normal physiological pH in mammals may be any pH from about 7.0 to about 7.8.

 Net charge as used herein refers to the balance of the number of positive charges and the number of negative charges carried by the amino acids present in the peptide. In this specification it is understood that net charges are measured at physiological pH. The naturally occurring amino acids that are positively charged at physiological pH include L lysine L arginine L histidine. The naturally occurring amino acids that are negatively charged at physiological pH include L aspartic acid and L glutamic acid.

Typically a peptide has a positively charged N terminal amino group and a negatively charged C terminal carboxyl group. The charges cancel each other out at physiological pH.

In one embodiment of the present invention the aromatic cationic peptides have a relationship between the minimum number of net positive charges at physiological pH p and the total number of amino acid residues r wherein 3pis the largest number that is less than or equal to r 1. In this embodiment the relationship between the minimum number of net positive charges p ad the total number of amino acid residues r is as follows 

In another embodiment the aromatic cationic peptides have a relationship between the minimum number of net positive charges p and the total number of amino acid residues r wherein 2pis the largest number that is less than or equal to r 1. In this embodiment the relationship between the minimum number of net positive charges p and the total number of amino acid residues r is as follows 

In one embodiment the minimum number of net positive charges p and the total number of amino acid residues r are equal. In another embodiment the peptides have three or four amino acid residues and a minimum of one net positive charge preferably a minimum of two net positive charges and more preferably a minimum of three net positive charges.

It is also important that the aromatic cationic peptides have a minimum number of aromatic groups in comparison to the total number of net positive charges p . The minimum number of aromatic groups will be referred to below as a .

Naturally occurring amino acids that have an aromatic group include the amino acids histidine tryptophan tyrosine and phenylalanine. For example the hexapeptide Lys Gln Tyr Arg Phe Trp has a net positive charge of two contributed by the lysine and arginine residues and three aromatic groups contributed by tyrosine phenylalanine and tryptophan residues .

In one embodiment of the present invention the aromatic cationic peptides useful in the methods of the present invention have a relationship between the minimum number of aromatic groups a and the total number of net positive charges at physiological pH p wherein 3a is the largest number that is less than or equal to p 1 except that when pis 1 a may also be 1. In this embodiment the relationship between the minimum number of aromatic groups a and the total number of net positive charges p is as follows 

In another embodiment the aromatic cationic peptides have a relationship between the minimum number of aromatic groups a and the total number of net positive charges p wherein 2a is the largest number that is less than or equal to p 1. In this embodiment the relationship between the minimum number of aromatic amino acid residues a and the total number of net positive charges p is as follows 

In another embodiment the number of aromatic groups a and the total number of net positive charges p are equal.

Carboxyl groups especially the terminal carboxyl group of a C terminal amino acid are preferably amidated with for example ammonia to form the C terminal amide Alternatively the terminal carboxyl group of the C terminal amino acid may be amidated with any primary or secondary amine. The primary or secondary amine may for example be an alkyl especially a branched or unbranched C Calkyl or an aryl amine. Accordingly the amino acid at the C terminus of the peptide may be converted to an amido N methylamido N ethylamido N N dimethylyamido N N diethylamido N methyl N ethylamido N phenylamido or N phenyl N ethylamido group.

The free carboxylate groups of the asparagine glutamine aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues not occurring at the C terminus of the aromatic cationic peptides of the present invention may also be amidated wherever they occur within the peptide. The amidation at these internal positions may be with ammonia or any of the primary or secondary amines described above.

In one embodiment the aromatic cationic peptide useful in the methods of the present invention is a tripeptide having two net positive charges and at least one aromatic amino acid. In a particular embodiment the aromatic cationic peptide useful in the methods of the present invention is a tripeptide having two net positive charges and two aromatic amino acids.

Aromatic cationic peptides useful in the methods of the present invention include but are not limited to the following peptide examples 

In one embodiment the peptides useful in the methods of the present invention have mu opioid receptor agonist activity i.e. activate the mu opioid receptor . Activation of the mu opioid receptor typically elicits an analgesic effect.

In certain instances an aromatic cationic peptide having mu opioid receptor activity is preferred. For example during short term treatment such as in an acute disease or condition it may be beneficial to use an aromatic cationic peptide that activates the mu opioid receptor. For example the acute diseases and conditions can be associated with moderate or severe pain. In these instances the analgesic effect of the aromatic cationic peptide may be beneficial in the treatment regiment of the patient or other mammal although an aromatic cationic peptide which does not activate the mu opioid receptor may also be used with or without an analgesic according to clinical requirements.

Alternatively in other instances an aromatic cationic peptide that does not have mu opioid receptor activity is preferred. For example during long term treatment such as in a chronic disease state or condition the use of an aromatic cationic peptide that activates the mu opioid receptor may be contraindicated. In these instances the potentially adverse or addictive effects of the aromatic cationic peptide may preclude the use of an aromatic cationic peptide that activates the mu opioid receptor in the treatment regimen of a human patients or other mammal.

Potential adverse effects may include sedation constipation nervous system depression and respiratory depression. In such instances aromatic cationic peptide that does not activate the mu opioid receptor may be an appropriate treatment.

Examples of acute conditions include heart attack stroke and traumatic injury. Traumatic injury may include traumatic brain and spinal cord injury.

Examples of chronic diseases or conditions include coronary artery disease and any neurodegenerative disorders such as those described below.

Peptides useful in the methods of the present invention which have mu opioid receptor activity are typically those peptides which have a trysine residue or a tyrosine derivative at the N terminus i.e. the first amino acid position . Preferred derivatives of tyrosine include 2 methyltyrosine Mmt 2 6 dimethyltyrosine 2 6 Dmt 3 5 dimethyltyrosine 3 5 Dmt N 2 6 trimethyltyrosine Tmt and 2 hydroxy 6 methyltryosine Hmt .

In a particular preferred embodiment a peptide that has mu opioid receptor activity has the formula Tyr D Arg Phe Lys NH for convenience represented by the acronym DALDA which is referred to herein as SS 01. DALDA has a net positive charge of three contributed by the amino acids tyrosine arginine and lysine and has two aromatic groups contributed by the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. The tyrosine of DALDA can be a modified derivative of tyrosine such as in 2 6 dimethyltyrosine to produce the compound having the formula 2 6 Dmt Arg Phe Lys NH i.e. Dmt DALDA which is referred to herein as SS 02 .

Peptides that do not have mu opioid receptor activity generally do not have a tyrosine residue or a derivative of tyrosine at the N terminus i.e. amino acid position one . The amino acid at the N terminus can be any naturally occurring or non naturally occurring amino acid other than tyrosine.

In one embodiment the amino acid at the N terminus is phenylalanine or its derivative. Preferred derivatives of phenylalanine include 2 methylphenylalanine Mmp 2 6 dimethylphenylalanine Dmp N 2 6 trimethylphenylalanine Tmp and 2 hydroxy 6 methylphenylalanine Hmp . In another preferred embodiment the amino acid residue at the N terminus is arginine. An example of such a peptide is D Arg 2 6 Dmt Lys Phe NH referred to in this specification as SS 31 .

Another aromatic cationic peptide that does not have mu opioid receptor activity has the formula Phe D Arg Dmt Lys NH. Alternatively the N terminal phenylalanine can be a derivative of phenylalanine such as 2 6 dimethylphenylalanine 2 6 Dmp . DALDA containing 2 6 dimethylphenylalanine at amino acid position one has the formula 2 6 Dmp D Arg Dmt Lys NH.

In a preferred embodiment the amino acid sequence of Dmt DALDA SS 02 is rearranged such that Dmt is not at the N terminus. An example of such an aromatic cationic peptide that does not have mu opioid receptor activity has the formula D Arg 2 6 Dmt Lys Phe NH SS 31 .

DALDA SS 31 and their derivatives can further include functional analogs. A peptide is considered a functional analog of DALDA or SS 31 if the analog has the same function as DALDA or SS 31. The analog may for example be a substitution variant of DALDA or SS 31 wherein one or more amino acid is substituted by another amino acid.

Suitable substitution variants of DALDA or SS 31 include conservative amino acid substitutions. Amino acids may be grouped according to their physicochemical characteristics as follows 

Substitutions of an amino acid link peptide by another amino acid in the same group is referred to as a conservative substitution and may preserve the physicochemical characteristics of the original peptide. In contrast substitutions of an amino acid in a peptide by another amino acid in a different group is generally more likely to alter the characteristics of the original peptide.

Examples of analogs useful in the practice of the present invention that activate mu opioid receptors include but are not limited to the aromatic cationic peptides shown in Table 1.

Examples of analogs useful in the practice of the present invention that do not activate mu opioid receptors include but are not limited to the aromatic cationic peptides shown in Table 2.

The amino acids of the peptides shown in table 1 and 2 may be in either the L or the D configuration.

The peptides described above are useful in reducing oxidative damage in a mammal in need thereof. Mammals in need of reducing oxidative damage are those mammals suffering from a disease condition or treatment associated with oxidative damage. Typically the oxidative damage is caused by free radicals such as reactive oxygen species ROS and or reactive nitrogen species RNS . Examples of ROS and RNS include hydroxyl radical HO superoxide anion radical O nitric oxide NO hydrogen peroxide HO hypochlorous acid HOCl and peroxynitrite anion. ONOO .

In one embodiment a mammal in need thereof may be a mammal undergoing a treatment associated with oxidative damage. For example the mammal may be undergoing reperfusion. Reperfusion refers to the restoration of blood flow to any organ or tissue in which the flow of blood is decreased or blocked. The restoration of blood flow during reperfusion leads to respiratory burst and formation of free radicals.

Decreased or blocked blood flow may be due to hypoxia or ischemia. The loss or severe reduction in blood supply during hypoxia or ischemia may for example be due to thromboembolic stroke coronary atherosclerosis or peripheral vascular disease.

Numerous organs and tissues are subject to ischemia or hypoxia. Examples of such organs include brain heart kidney intestine and prostate. The tissue affected is typically muscle such as cardiac skeletal or smooth muscle. For instance cardiac muscle ischemia or hypoxia is commonly caused by atherosclerotic or thrombotic blockages which lead to the reduction or loss of oxygen delivery to the cardiac tissues by the cardiac arterial and capillary blood supply. Such cardiac ischemia or hypoxia may cause pain and necrosis of the affected cardiac muscle and ultimately may lead to cardiac failure.

Ischemia or hypoxia in skeletal muscle or smooth muscle may arise from similar causes. For example ischemia or hypoxia in intestinal smooth muscle or skeletal muscle of the limbs may also be caused by atherosclerotic or thrombotic blockages.

The restoration of blood flow reperfusion can occur by any method known to those in the art. For instance reperfusion of ischemic cardiac tissues may arise from angioplasty coronary artery bypass graft or the use of thrombolytic drugs. Reducing oxidative damage associated with ischemia hypoxia and reperfusion is important because the tissue damage associated with ischemia hypoxia and reperfusion is associated with for example myocardial infarction stroke and hemorrhagic shock.

In another embodiment a mammal in need thereof can be a mammal with a disease or condition associated with oxidative damage. The oxidative damage can occur in any cell tissue or organ of the mammal. Examples of cells tissues or organs include but are not limited to endothelial cells epithelial cells nervous system cells skin heart lung kidney and liver. For example lipid peroxidation and an inflammatory process are associated with oxidative damage for a disease or condition.

Lipid peroxidation refers to oxidative modification of lipids. The lipids can be present in the membrane of a cell. This modification of membrane lipids typically results in change and or damage to the membrane function of a cell. In addition lipid peroxidation can also occur in lipids or lipoproteins exogenous of a cell. For example low density lipoproteins are susceptible to lipid per oxidation. An example of a condition associated with lipid peroxidation is atherosclerosis. Reducing oxidative damage associated with atherosclerosis is important since atherosclerosis is implicated in for example heart attacks and coronary artery disease.

Inflammatory process refers to the activation of the immune system. Typically the immune system is activated by an antigenic substance. The antigenic substance can be any substance recognized by the immune system and include self derived particles and foreign derived particles. Examples of diseases or conditions occurring from an inflammatory process to self derived particles include arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Examples of foreign particles include viruses and bacteria.

The virus can be any virus which activates an inflammatory process and associated with oxidative damage. Examples of viruses include hepatitis A B or C virus human immunodeficiency virus influenza virus and bovine diarrhea virus. For example hepatitis virus can elicit an inflammatory process and formation of free radicals thereby damaging the liver.

The bacteria can be any bacteria and include gram negative or gram positive bacteria. Gram negative bacteria contain lipopolysaccharide in the bacteria wall. Examples of gram negative bacterial include species and . Examples of gram positive bacteria include and

An example of an inflammatory process associated with oxidative stress caused by a bacteria is sepsis. Typically sepsis occurs when gram negative bacteria enter the bloodstream.

Liver damage caused by a toxic agent is another condition associated with an inflammatory process and oxidative stress. The toxic agent can be any agent which causes damage to the liver. For example the toxic agent can cause apoptosis and or necrosis of liver cells. Examples of such agents include alcohol and medication such as prescription and non prescription drugs taken to treat a disease or condition.

The methods of the present invention can also be used in reducing oxidative damage associated with any neurodegenerative disease or condition. The neurodegenerative disease can affect any cell tissue or organ of the central and peripheral nervous system. Examples of such cells tissues and organs include the brain spinal cord neurons ganglia Schwann cells astrocytes oligodendrocytes and microglia.

The neurodegenerative condition can be an acute condition such as a stroke or a traumatic brain or spinal cord injury. In another embodiment the neurodegenerative disease or condition can be a chronic neurodegenerative condition. In a chronic neurodegenerative condition the free radicals can for example cause damage to a protein. An example of such a protein is amyloid protein. Examples of chronic neurodegenerative diseases associated with damage by free radicals include Parkinson s disease Alzheimer s disease Huntington s disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis also known as Lou Gherig s disease .

Other conditions which can be treated in accordance with the present invention include preeclampsia diabetes and symptoms of and conditions associated with aging such as macular degeneration wrinkles.

In another embodiment the peptides useful in the present invention may also be used in reducing oxidative damage in an organ of a mammal prior to transplantation. For example a removed organ when subjected to reperfusion after transplantation can be susceptible to oxidative damage. Therefore the peptides can be used to reduce oxidative damage from reperfusion of the transplanted organ.

The removed organ can be any organ suitable for transplantation. Examples of such organs include the heart liver kidney lung and pancreatic islets. The removed organ is placed in a suitable medium such as in a standard buffered solution commonly used in the art.

For example a removed heart can be placed in a cardioplegic solution containing the peptides described above. The concentration of peptides in the standard buffered solution can be easily determined by those skilled in the art. Such concentrations may be for example between about 0.01 nM to about 10 M preferably about 0.1 nM to about 10 M more preferably about 1 M to about 5 M and even more preferably about 1 nM to about 100 nM.

In yet another embodiment the invention provides a method for reducing oxidative damage in a cell in need thereof. Cells in need of reducing oxidative damage are generally those cells in which the cell membrane or DNA of the cell has been damaged by free radicals for example ROS and or RNS. Examples of cells capable of being subjected to oxidative damage include the cells described herein. Suitable examples of cells include pancreatic islet cells myocytes endothelial cells neuronal cells stem cells etc.

The cells can be tissue culture cells. Alternatively the cells may be obtained from a mammal. In one instance the cells can be damaged by oxidative damage as a result of an insult. Such insults include for example a disease or condition e.g. diabetes etc. or ultraviolet radiation e.g. sun etc. . For example pancreatic islet cells damaged by oxidative damage as a result of diabetes can be obtained from a mammal.

The peptides described above can be administered to the cells by any method known to those skilled in the art. For example the peptides can be incubated with the cells under suitable conditions. Stick conditions can be readily determined by those skilled in the art.

Due to reduction of oxidative damage the treated cells may be capable of regenerating. Such regenerated cells may be administered back into the mammal as a therapeutic treatment for a disease or condition. As mentioned above one such condition is diabetes.

Oxidative damage is considered to be reduced if the amount of oxidative damage in a mammal a removed organ or a cell is decreased after administration of an effective amount of the aromatic cationic peptides described above. Typically the oxidative damage is considered to be reduced if the oxidative damage is decreased by at least about 10 preferably at least about 25 more preferably at least about 50 even more preferably at least about 75 and most preferably at least about 90 .

The peptides useful in the methods of the present invention may be chemically synthesized by any of the methods well known in the art. Suitable methods for synthesizing the protein include for example those described by Stuart and Young in Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis Second Edition Pierce Chemical Company 1984 and in Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis 289 Academic Press Inc New York 1997 .

The peptide useful in the methods of the present invention is administered to a mammal in an amount effective in reducing oxidative damage. The effective amount is determined during pre clinical trials and clinical trials by methods familiar to physicians and clinicians.

An effective amount of a peptide useful in the methods of the present invention preferably in a pharmaceutical composition may be administered to a mammal in need thereof by any of a number of well known methods for administering pharmaceutical compounds.

The peptide may be administered systemically or locally. In one embodiment the peptide is administered intravenously. For example the aromatic cationic peptides useful in the methods of the present invention may be administered via rapid intravenous bolus injection. Preferably however the peptide is administered as a constant rate intravenous infusion.

The peptide can be injected directly into coronary artery during for example angioplasty of or coronary bypass surgery or applied onto coronary stents.

The peptide may also be administered orally topically intranasally intramuscularly subcutaneously or transdermally.

On day 4 cells were washed twice with pre warmed HBSS and then incubated with 0.2 ml of HBSS containing either 250 nM H Dmt DALDA at 37 C. for 4 C. for various times up to 1 h.

 H Dmt DALDA was observed in cell lysate as early as 5 min and steady state levels were achieved by 30 min. The total amount of H Dmt DALDA recovered in the cell lysate after 1 h incubation represented about 1 of the total drug. The uptake of H Dmt DALDA was slower at 4 C. compared to 37 C. but reached 76.5 by 45 min and 86.3 by 1 h. The internalization of H Dmt DALDA was not limited to Caco 2 cells but was also observed in SH SY5Y HEK293 and CRFK cells. The intracellular concentration of Dmt DALDA was estimated to be approximately 50 times higher than extracellular concentration.

CLSM showed the uptake of fluorescent Dmt AtnDap DALDA into Caco 2 cells after incubation for as little as 15 min at 37 C. The uptake of dye was completely excluded from the nucleus but the blue dye showed a streaky distribution within the cytoplasm. Mitochondria were labeled red with TMRM. The distribution of Dmt AtnDap DALDA to mitochondria was demonstrated by the overlap of the Dmt AtnDap DALDA distribution and the TMRM distribution.

Incubation of NA cells with 50 mM tBHP for 6 h resulted in Annexin V staining on the membranes of most cells . Combined staining with Annexin V and propidium iodide red showed many late apoptotic cells . Concurrent treatment of NA cells with 1 nM SS 31 and 50 M tBHP resulted in a reduction in Annexin V positive cells and no propidium iodide staining suggesting that SS 31 protected against tBHP induced apoptosis.

The morphological appearance of cells treated with tBHP was also consistent with apoptosis. NA cells incubated with 50 M tBHP for 12 h became rounded and shrunken panel b .

The cell loss was significantly ameliorated by administration of SS 31 . Immunostaining for markers of oxidative and nitrosative stress 4 hydroxynonenenal 3 nitrotyrosine showed increased levels of lipid peroxidation and protein nitration in the spinal cord of G93A as compared to control mice. This was markedly reduced in the SS 31 treated mice 4 hydroxynonenenal 3 nitrotyrosine .

Ascorbate and GSH in addition to cysteine were determined in the postischemic cortex and striatum. While cysteine levels were generally decreased in both hemispheres after ischemia they were significantly higher in the ipsilateral side compared to the contralateral side and B . By contrast the levels of ascorbate and GSH the major water soluble intracellular antioxidants in brain were progressively decreased in the ipsilateral side within a few hours of reperfusion . Antioxidant reduction was significant in both cortex and striatum at 6 h and was further reduced at 24 h at a time when the infarct is visible.

To test the efficacy of SS 31 on redox status cysteine ascorbate and GSH levels were determined 6 h after 30 min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion MCAO in mice treated intraperitoneally i.p. with saline vehicle SS 31 2 mg kg or SS 20 2 mg kg upon reperfusion. Values in are expressed as percent increase cysteine and percent depletion ascorbate and GSH in the ipsilateral side compared to the contralateral side. Absolute values were originally expressed as nmoles mg protein as shown in and converted to percent difference. The percent ipsilateral cysteine increase was similar among vehicle SS 31 and SS 20 treated groups . Percent ipsilateral depletion of ascorbate was marginally but not significantly affected in both SS 31 and SS 20 treated animals . In contrast ischemia induced GSH depletion in the cortex was significantly attenuated in SS 31 treated animals compared to the vehicle treated group .

The degree of ipsilateral GSH depletion in SS 20 treated mice was not significantly different from that of vehicle treated mice . The data show that SS 31 assists in maintaining antioxidant status and protects against ischemia induced depletion of GSH in the cortex.

To address whether SS 31 induced attenuation in GSH depletion is associated with neuroprotection mice were subjected to 30 or 20 min MCAO and then treated with vehicle or SS 31 2 mg kg i.p. upon reperfusion and at 6 h 24 h 48 h after MCAO.

SS 31 treatment resulted in moderate but significant reduction in infarct volume following both 30 min 24 reduction and 20 min 30 reduction ischemia . Treatment with SS 31 also significantly attenuated hemispheric swelling in both 30 and 20 min ischemic paradigms . There was no difference in cerebral blood flow CBF reduction during MCAO and reperfusion at 10 min between vehicle and SS 31 treated groups indicating that the neuroprotective effect by SS 31 occurs via mechanisms other than altered CBF during and after the ischemic insult.

Islets are tightly adherent cell clusters and entry of peptides proteins may be impaired given their architecture. shows that SS 31 readily penetrates intact mouse islets in four consecutive experiments the mean SE of H SS 31 uptake was 70.2 10.3 pmol mg of protein.

Mitochondrial depolarization and the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm are critical antecedent events to cell death. TMRM a fluorescent cationic indicator is taken up into mitochondria in a potential dependent manner. confocal laser scanning microscopic imaging of TMRM treated islets shows that the islets from mice treated with SS 31 exhibit greater uptake of TMRM compared to islets from mice not treated with SS 31.

To investigate whether the SS 31 optimizes islet isolation and results in increased islet yield islet donor mice were pre treated with SS 31. SS 31 resulted in a significantly higher islet cell yield compared to untreated mice the mean SE islet yield from the pancreata harvested from SS 31 pre treated mice was 291 60 islets per pancreas N 6 separate islet isolations from 28 pancreata compared to 242 53 islets per pancreas retrieved from the control mice N 6 separate islet isolations from 30 pancreata P 0.03 Two tailed Pvalue calculated with Mann Whitney test .

SS 31 treatment in addition to enhancing islet yield resulted in a significant decrease in early as well as late islet cell apoptosis. Dual parameter flow cytometry analyses of islet cells stained with both Annexin V and propidium iodide demonstrated that the treatment of islet donor mice with SS 31 reduced the percentage of early apoptotic cells Annexin V alone positive cells from 11.4 2.4 to 5.5 1.0 P 0.03 . SS 31 treatment reduced late apoptosis early necrosis Annexin V PI cells from 22.7 4.7 to 12.6 1.8 P 0.03 and increased islet cell viability Annexin V PI cells from 47 5.1 to 62 3.5 P 0.03 . SS 31 treatment of islet donor mice however did not reduce the percentage of necrotic cells PI cells 20 3.2 vs. 19 4.7 P 1.0 .

The SS 31 treatment associated decrease in islet cell apoptosis and enhanced viability had a beneficial functional consequence. In a marginal islet cell mass transplantation model 0 of 8 recipients of islets isolated from pancreas harvested from the control mice had successful reversal of hyperglycemia defined as three consecutive blood glucose levels
