The present application is a non provisional of and claims the benefit and priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of the following applications the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes 

The present disclosure relates to computer systems and software and more particularly to techniques for facilitating and automating the provision of services in a cloud environment.

Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources e.g. networks servers storage applications and services . The services provided or accessed through the cloud or network are referred to as cloud services. There is a lot of processing that needs to be performed by a cloud service provider to make cloud services available to a subscribing customer. Due to its complexity much of this processing is still done manually. For example provisioning resources for providing such cloud services can be a very labor intensive process.

Embodiments of the present invention are directed to systems and methods for providing archival support for one or more services provided by a cloud infrastructure system. The increasing use of services offered in the cloud has led to large amounts of a customer s data being stored remotely in the cloud. Archival support enables customers to retrieve copies of their information associated with each cloud service. This allows for customers to back up their data periodically or on demand and save data upon termination or suspension of service. This provides customers with control over their information reduces risks which some customers may associate with cloud services and enables customers to easily exit cloud services without a loss of data.

In accordance with an embodiment for a given service an archival process may be performed in response to certain trigger situations. For example an archival process may be executed upon the termination of a service suspension of a service upon a customer request and the like. Once a trigger event has occurred a message is received related to the trigger event. For example if a service is being terminated a request to terminate the service is received. The message can be analyzed to determine which services are to be archived and instructions can be sent to those services to generate archives. Once the archives are generated they can be moved to a customer accessible location such as a secure file server.

This summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used in isolation to determine the scope of the claimed subject matter. The subject matter should be understood by reference to appropriate portions of the entire specification of this patent any or all drawings and each claim.

The various modules of the cloud infrastructure system depicted in are meant for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of embodiments of the present invention. Alternative embodiments may include more or fewer modules than those shown in .

In an exemplary operation at a customer using a client device such as client device or may interact with cloud infrastructure system by browsing the various services provided by cloud infrastructure system and placing an order for a subscription for one or more services offered by cloud infrastructure system . In certain embodiments the customer may access store UI or cloud UI and place a subscription order via these user interfaces.

The order information received by cloud infrastructure system in response to the customer placing an order may include information identifying the customer and one or more services offered by the cloud infrastructure system that the customer intends to subscribe to. A single order may include orders for multiple services. For instance a customer may login to cloud UI and request a subscription for a CRM service and a Java cloud service in the same order.

Additionally the order may also include one or more service levels for the ordered services. As used herein and as will be discussed in greater detail below a service level for a service determines the amount of resources to be allocated for providing the requested service in the context of the subscription such as the amount of storage amount of computing resources data transfer facilities and the like. For example a basic service level may provide a minimum level of storage data transmission or number of users and higher service levels may include additional resources.

In addition in some instances the order information received by cloud infrastructure system may include information indicative of a customer level and the time period during which the service is desired. The customer level specifies the priority of the customer making the subscription request. In one example the priority may be determined based on the quality of service that the cloud infrastructure system guarantees or promises the customer as specified by a Service Level Agreement SLA agreed to between the customer and the provider of the cloud services. In one example the different customer levels include a basic level a silver level and a gold level. The time period for a service may specify the start date and time for the service and the time period for which the service is desired e.g. a service end date and time may be specified .

In one embodiment a customer may request a new subscription via store UI or request for a trial subscription via cloud UI . In certain embodiments store UI may represent the service provider s eCommerce store front e.g. www.oracle.com store for Oracle Cloud services . Cloud UI may represent a business interface for the service provider. Consumer can explore available services and sign up for interested services through cloud UI . Cloud UI captures user input necessary for ordering trial subscriptions provided by cloud infrastructure system . Cloud UI may also be used to view account features and configure the runtime environment located within cloud infrastructure system . In addition to placing an order for a new subscription store UI may also enable the customer to perform other subscription related tasks such as changing the service level of a subscription extending the term of the subscription increasing the service level of a subscription terminating an existing subscription and the like.

After an order has been placed per at the order information that is received via either store UI or cloud UI is stored in order database which can be one of several databases operated by cloud infrastructure system and utilized in conjunction with other system elements. While order database is shown logically as a single database in in actual implementation this may comprise one or more databases.

At the order is forwarded to order management module . Order management module is configured to perform billing and accounting functions related to the order such as verifying the order and upon verification booking the order. In certain embodiments order management module may include a contract management module and an install base module. The contract management module may store contract information associated with the customer s subscription order such as the customer s service level agreement SLA with cloud infrastructure system . The install base module may include detailed descriptions of the services in the customer s subscription order. In addition to order information the install base module may track installation details related to the services product status and support service history related to the services. As a customer orders new services or upgrades existing ones the install base module may automatically add new order information.

At information regarding the order is communicated to TAS module . In one embodiment TAS module utilizes the order information to orchestrate the provisioning of services and resources for the order placed by the customer. At TAS component orchestrates the provisioning of resources to support the subscribed services using the services of SDI module . At TAS module provides information related to the provisioned order received from SDI module to services module . In some embodiments at SDI module may also use services provided by services module to allocate and configure the resources needed to fulfill the customer s subscription order.

At services module sends a notification to the customers on client devices and regarding the status of the order.

In certain embodiments TAS module functions as an orchestration component that manages business processes associated with each order and applies business logic to determine whether an order should proceed to provisioning. In one embodiment upon receiving an order for a new subscription TAS module sends a request to SDI module to allocate resources and configure those resources needed to fulfill the subscription order. SDI module enables the allocation of resources for the services ordered by the customer. SDI module provides a level of abstraction between the cloud services provided by cloud infrastructure system and the physical implementation layer that is used to provision the resources for providing the requested services. TAS module may thus be isolated from implementation details such as whether or not services and resources are actually provisioned on the fly or pre provisioned and only allocated assigned upon request.

In certain embodiments a user may use store UI to directly interact with order management module to perform billing and accounting related functions such as verifying the order and upon verification booking the order. In some embodiments instead of a customer placing an order at the order may instead be placed by sales personnel on behalf of the customer such as a customer s service representative or sales representative. Sales personnel may directly interact with order management module via a user interface not shown in provided by order management module for placing orders or for providing quotes for the customer. This for example may be done for large customers where the order may be placed by the customer s sales representative through order management module . The sales representative may set up the subscription on behalf of the customer.

EM module is configured to monitor activities related to managing and tracking a customer s subscription in cloud infrastructure system . EM module collects usage statistics for the services in the subscription order such as the amount of storage used the amount data transferred the number of users and the amount of system up time and system down time. At a host operator personnel who may be an employee of a provider of cloud infrastructure system may interact with EM module via an enterprise manager user interface not shown in to manage systems and resources on which services are provisioned within cloud infrastructure system .

Identity management IDM module is configured to provide identity services such as access management and authorization services in cloud infrastructure system . In one embodiment IDM module controls information about customers who wish to utilize the services provided by cloud infrastructure system . Such information can include information that authenticates the identities of such customers and information that describes which actions those customers are authorized to perform relative to various system resources e.g. files directories applications communication ports memory segments etc. IDM module can also include the management of descriptive information about each customer and about how and by whom that descriptive information can be accessed and modified.

In one embodiment information managed by the identity management module can be partitioned to create separate identity domains. Information belonging to a particular identity domain can be isolated from all other identity domains. Also an identity domain can be shared by multiple separate tenants. Each such tenant can be a customer subscribing to services in the cloud infrastructure system . In some embodiments a customer can have one or many identity domains and each identity domain may be associated with one or more subscriptions each subscription having one or many services. For example a single customer can represent a large entity and identity domains may be created for divisions departments within this large entity. EM module and IDM module may in turn interact with order management module at and respectively to manage and track the customer s subscriptions in cloud infrastructure system .

In one embodiment at support services may also be provided to the customer via a support UI . In one embodiment support UI enables support personnel to interact with order management module via a support backend system to perform support services at . Support personnel in the cloud infrastructure system as well as customers can submit bug reports and check the status of these reports via support UI .

Other interfaces not shown in may also be provided by cloud infrastructure system . For example an identity domain administrator may use a user interface to IDM module to configure domain and user identities. In addition customers may log into a separate interface for each service they wish to utilize. In certain embodiments a customer who wishes to subscribe to one or more services offered by cloud infrastructure system may also be assigned various roles and responsibilities. In one embodiment the different roles and responsibilities that may be assigned for a customer may include that of a buyer an account administrator a service administrator an identity domain administrator or a user who utilizes the services and resources offered by cloud infrastructure system . The different roles and responsibilities are described more fully in below.

At a customer s subscription order is processed. The processing may include validating the order in one example. Validating the order includes ensuring that the customer has paid for the subscription and ensuring that the customer does not already have subscriptions with the same name or that the customer is not attempting to create multiple subscriptions of the same type in the same identity domain for subscription types for which this is disallowed such as in the case of a CRM service . Processing may also include tracking the status of an order for each order that is being processed by cloud infrastructure system .

At a business process associated with the order is identified. In some instances multiple business processes may be identified for an order. Each business process identifies a series of steps for processing various aspects of the order. As an example a first business process may identify one or more steps related to provisioning physical resources for the order a second business process may identify one or more steps related to creating an identity domain along with customer identities for the order a third business process may identify one or more steps for related to performing back office functions such as creating a customer record for the user performing accounting functions related to the order and the like. In certain embodiments different business processes may also be identified for processing different services in an order. For example different business process may be identified to process a CRM service and a database service.

At the business process identified for the order in is executed. Executing the business process associated with the order may include orchestrating the series of steps associated with the business process identified in step . For example executing a business process related to provisioning physical resources for the order may include sending a request to SDI module to allocate resources and configure those resources needed to fulfill the subscription order.

At a notification is sent to the customer regarding the status of the provisioned order. Additional description related to performing steps and is provided in detail in .

In one embodiment order processing module receives an order from a customer from one or more input sources . For example order processing module may directly receive an order via cloud UI or store UI in one embodiment. Alternatively order processing module may receive an order from order management module or order database . Order processing module then processes the order. In certain embodiments processing the order includes generating a customer record which includes information about the order such as a service type a service level a customer level the type of resources the amount of the resources to be allocated to the service instance and a time period during which the service is desired. As part of the processing order processing module also determines whether the order is a valid order. This includes ensuring that the customer does not already have subscriptions with the same name or that the customer is not attempting to create multiple subscriptions of the same type in the same identity domain for subscription types where this is disallowed such as in the case of a fusion CRM service .

Order processing module may also perform additional processing on the order. Processing may include tracking the status of an order for each order that is being processed by cloud infrastructure system . In one embodiment order processing module may process each order to identify a number of states pertaining to the order. In one example the different states of an order may be an initialized state a provisioned state an active state an administration required state an error state and the like. An initialized state refers to the state of a new order a provisioned state refers to the state of an order once the services and resources for the order have been provisioned. An order is in an active state when the order has been processed by TAS module and a notification to that effect has been delivered to the customer. An order is in an administration required state when intervention by an administrator is needed to resolve the issue. The order is in an error state when the order cannot be processed. In addition to maintaining the order progress status order processing module also maintains detailed information about any failures encountered during process execution. In other embodiments and as will be discussed in detail below the additional processing performed by order processing module may also include changing the service level for a service in the subscription changing the services included in the subscription extending the time period of the subscription and canceling the subscription or specifying different service levels for different time periods in the subscription.

After an order has been processed by order processing module business logic is applied to determine whether the order should proceed to provisioning. In one embodiment as part of orchestrating the order business process identifier receives the processed order from order processing module and applies business logic to identify a particular business process to use for the order being processed. In one embodiment business process identifier may utilize information stored in a service catalog to determine the particular business process to be used for the order. In one embodiment and as discussed in multiple business processes may be identified for an order and each business process identifies a series of steps for processing various aspects of the order. In another embodiment and as discussed above different business processes may be defined for different types of services or combinations of services such as a CRM service or a database service. In one embodiment service catalog may store information mapping an order to a particular type of business process. Business process identifier may use this information to identify a specific business process for the order being processed.

Once a business process has been identified business process identifier communicates the particular business process to be executed to business process executor . Business process executor then executes steps of the identified business process by operating in conjunction with one or more modules in the cloud infrastructure system . In some embodiments business process executor acts as an orchestrator for performing the steps associated with a business process. For example the business process executor may interact with order processing module to execute steps in a business process that identifies workflows related to the order determines the overage of services in the order or identifies service components related to the order.

In one example business process executor interacts with SDI module to execute steps in a business process for allocating and provisioning resources for services requested in the subscription order. In this example for each step in the business process business process executor may send a request to SDI component to allocate resources and configure resources needed to fulfill the particular step. SDI component is responsible for the actual allocation of the resources. Once all the steps of the business processes of an order have been executed business process executor may send a notification to the customer of the processed order by utilizing the services of services component . The notification may include sending an email notification to the customer with details of the processed order. The email notification may also include deployment information related to the order to enable the customer to access the subscribed services.

In certain embodiments TAS module may provide one or more TAS Application Programming Interfaces APIs that enable TAS module to interact with other modules in cloud infrastructure system and for other modules to interact with TAS module . For example the TAS APIs may include a system provisioning API that interacts with SDI module via an asynchronous Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP based web services call to provision resources for the customer s subscription order. In one embodiment TAS module may also utilize the system provisioning API to accomplish system and service instance creation and deletion switch a service instance to an increased service level and associate service instances. An example of this is the association of a Java service instance to a fusion applications service instance to allow secure web service communications. The TAS APIs may also include a notification API that interacts with the services module to notify the customer of a processed order. In certain embodiments the TAS module also periodically propagates subscription information outages and notifications e.g. planned downtime to services component .

In certain embodiments TAS module periodically receives usage statistics for each of the provisioned services such as the amount of storage used the amount data transferred the number of users and the amount of system up time and system down time from EM module . Overage framework utilizes the usage statistics to determine whether over use of a service has occurred and if so to determine how much to bill for the overage and provides this information to order management module .

In certain embodiments TAS module includes an order workflow identification module that is configured to identify one or more workflows associated with processing a customer s subscription order. In certain embodiments TAS module may include a subscription order generation framework for generating subscription orders for a customer when the customer places a subscription order for one or more services offered by the cloud infrastructure system . In one embodiment a subscription order includes one or more service components responsible for providing the services requested by a customer in the subscription order.

Additionally TAS module may also interact with one or more additional databases such as a Tenant Information System TIS database to enable the provisioning of resources for one or more services subscribed by the customer while taking into consideration historical information if any available for the customer. TIS database may include historical order information and historical usage information pertaining to orders subscribed by the customer.

TAS module may be deployed using different deployment models. In certain embodiments the deployment includes a central component that interfaces with one or more distributed components. The distributed components may for example be deployed as various data centers and accordingly may also be referred to as data center components. The central component includes capabilities to process orders and co ordinate services in cloud infrastructure system while the data center components provide capabilities for provisioning and operating the runtime system that provides the resources for the subscribed services.

In one embodiment the responsibilities of TAS central component include without limitation to provide a centralized component for receiving customer orders performing order related business operations such as creating a new subscription changing the service level for a service in the subscription changing the services included in the subscription and extending the time period of the subscription or canceling the subscription. The responsibilities of TAS central component may also include maintaining and serving subscription data needed by cloud infrastructure system and interfacing with order management module support UI cloud UI and store UI to handle all the back office interactions.

In one embodiment the responsibilities of TAS DCs and include without limitation performing runtime operations for orchestrating the provisioning the resources for one or more services subscribed by the customer. TAS DCs and also include capabilities to perform operations such as locking unlocking enabling or disabling a subscription order collecting metrics related to the order determining the status of the order and sending notification events related to the order.

In an exemplary operation of the distributed TAS system shown in TAS central component initially receives an order from a customer via cloud UI store UI via order management system or via order database . In one embodiment the customer represents a buyer who has financial information and the authority to order and or change a subscription. In one embodiment the order information includes information identifying the customer the type of services that the customer wishes to subscribe to and an account administrator who will be responsible for handling the request. In certain embodiments the account administrator may be nominated by the customer when the customer places an order for a subscription to one or more services offered by cloud infrastructure system . Based on the order information the TAS central component identifies the data region of the world such as Americas EMEA or Asia Pacific in which the order originates and the particular TAS DCs for e.g. or that will be deployed for provisioning the order. In one embodiment the particular TAS DC for e.g. from among DCs or that will be deployed for provisioning the order is determined based on the geographical data region in which the request originated.

TAS central component then sends the order request to the particular TAS DC in which to provision services for the order request. In one embodiment TAS DCs or identify a service administrator and an identity domain administrator responsible for processing the order request at the particular TAS DC. The service administrator and the identity administrator may be nominated by the account administrator identified in the subscription order. TAS DCs or communicate with SDI module to orchestrate the provisioning of physical resources for the order. SDI component in respective TAS DCs or allocates resources and configures those resources needed to fulfill the subscription order.

In certain embodiments TAS DCs or identify an identity domain associated with the subscription. SDI component may provide the identity domain information to IDM component shown in for identifying an existing identity domain or creating a new identity domain. Once the order is provisioned by the SDI module at respective TAS DCs or TAS central component may place information regarding the provisioned resources in a support system via support UI . Information may include for example displaying resource metrics related to the services and usage statistics of the services.

Once in operation at each data center EM module to periodically collects usage statistics for each of the provisioned services provisioned at that data center such as the amount of storage used the amount data transferred the number of users and the amount of system up time and system down time. These statistics are provided to the TAS DC that is local to EM module i.e. at the same data center .

At the subscription order is provisioned based on the series of tasks. In one embodiment and as discussed in SDI connector module includes one or more connectors for handling the deployment of tasks specified by SDI task manager module to provision resources for the services in the subscription order.

As described above with respect to SDI task manager module translates each step specified in a business process into a series of tasks by utilizing the services of SDI connector module which may include one or more connectors for handling the deployment of tasks specified by SDI task manager module to provision one or more services related to the order request. One or more of the connectors may handle tasks that are specific to a particular service type while other connectors may handle tasks that are common across different service types. In one embodiment SDI connector module includes a set of connectors wrapper APIs that interface with one or more of the external modules shown in in cloud infrastructure system to provision the services and resources related to the order request. For example a NUVIAQ connector interfaces with VAB module to provision Java services.

In certain embodiments Nuviaq system may be configured to provide a runtime engine for orchestrating PaaS operations. Nuviaq system may provide a web service API to facilitate integration with other products and services. Nuviaq system also provides support for complex workflows in system provisioning application deployment and associated lifecycle operations and integrates with management and monitoring solutions.

In the embodiment depicted in Nuviaq system comprises a Nuviaq proxy a Nuviaq manager and a Nuviaq database . In certain embodiments Nuviaq manager provides an entry point into Nuviaq system providing secure access to PaaS operations via the web service API. Internally it tracks system state in the database and controls job execution on the workflow engine. In a public cloud Nuviaq manager may be accessed by the Tenant Provisioning system SDI and the Tenant Console to drive provisioning and deployment operations respectively.

In one embodiment Nuviaq manager executes jobs asynchronously via an internal workflow engine. A job may be a sequence of actions specific to a given PaaS workflow. Actions may be performed in order with failure in any step resulting in failure of the overall job. Many workflow actions delegate to external systems relevant to the workflow such as the EM command line interface cli . In one implementation Nuviaq manager application may be hosted in a 2 node WebLogic cluster with associated HTTP server e.g. Oracle HTTP Server or OHS instance running inside a firewall.

In certain embodiments Nuviaq proxy is the public access point to the Nuviaq API. In one embodiment only Public API may be exposed here. Requests received by proxy may be forwarded to Nuviaq manager . In one embodiment Nuviaq proxy runs outside the firewall whereas manager runs within the firewall. In one implementation Nuviaq proxy application runs on a WebLogic cluster running outside the firewall.

In certain embodiments Nuviaq database tracks various domain entities such as without limitation platform instance deployment plan application WebLogic domain jobs alerts and the like. Primary keys may be aligned with the Service Database where appropriate.

In one embodiment Platform Instance may contain all resources required for a WebLogic service for a given tenant.

Nuviaq system may rely on additional systems of cloud infrastructure system to carry out the workflows used the WebLogic cloud service. These dependencies may include dependencies on SDI IDM a virus scan system a service database CRM instances and the like. For example Nuviaq system may depend upon functions performed by an Assembly Deployer in SDI . In one embodiment the Assembly Deployer is a system to manage interactions with OVAB Oracle Virtual Assembly Builder and OVM Oracle Virtual Machine . Capabilities of the Assembly Deployer used by Nuviaq system may include without limitation functions for deploying an assembly un deploying an assembly describing assembly deployment scaling appliance and the like. In one implementation Nuviaq system accesses the Assembly Deployer via a web service API.

In certain embodiments security policies may require certain artifacts to be scanned for viruses before being deployed to an application. Cloud infrastructure system may provide a virus scan system for this purpose that provides scanning as a service for multiple components of the public cloud.

In certain embodiments a public cloud infrastructure may maintain a Service Database containing information about tenants e.g. customers and their service subscriptions. Nuviaq workflows may access to this data in order to properly configure a WebLogic service as a client to other services that the tenant also subscribes to.

Nuviaq system may depend on IDM for its security integration. In certain embodiments Java Service instances can be associated with a CRM instance. The association allows user applications deployed to their Java Service instance to access a CRM instance though Web Service calls.

Various entities may use services provided by Nuviaq system . These clients of Nuviaq system may include a Tenant Console which is an management server e.g. Oracle Management Server based user interface that customers may access to manage their applications on their platform instances several IDEs such as Oracle IDEs JDeveloper NetBeans and OEPE have been extended to offer access to application lifecycle management operations one or more Command Line Interfaces CLIs that are available to access lifecycle operations on the platform instances.

Provisioning use case for Nuviaq system A Provision Platform Instance use case is realized via the Create Platform Instance operation of the Nuviaq API. In the context of cloud infrastructure system a service instance with respect to the Nuviaq system corresponds to a Nuviaq platform instance. A platform instance is assigned a unique identifier is used on all subsequent operations related to this instance. A Platform Deployment descriptor provided to the Create Platform Instance action allows for properties to be set that modify the configuration of the platform instance to meet the subscription requirements of the tenant. These properties may include for example 

Install Update Application use case The Install Application operation deploys an application to a running WebLogic Server after validating that the application archive meets the security requirements of the Public Cloud. In one embodiment the Application Deployment descriptor provided to the Install Application action allows for properties to be set that modify the configuration of the application to meet the subscription requirements of the tenant. These properties may include for example 

Accordingly in certain embodiments TAS and SDI working in cooperation are responsible for provisioning resources for one or more services ordered by a customer from a set of services offered by cloud infrastructure system . For example in one embodiment for provisioning a database service the automated provisioning flow may be as follows for a paid subscription 

 3 When services are available TAS initiates provisioning by using the services of SDI . TAS may perform business process orchestration which will execute the relevant business process to complete the provisioning aspect of the order. In one embodiment TAS may use a BPEL Business Process Execution Language Process Manager to orchestrate the steps involved in the provisioning and handle the lifecycle operations. 4 In one embodiment to provision a database service SDI may call PLSQL APIs in the CLOUD UI to associate a schema for the requesting customer. 5 After successful association of a schema to the customer SDI signals TAS and TAS send a notification to the customer that the database service is now available for use by the customer. 6 The customer may log into cloud infrastructure system e.g. using an URAL such as cloud.oracle.com and activate the service.

In some embodiments a customer may also be allowed to subscribe to a service on a trial basis. For example such a trial order may be received via cloud UI e.g. using cloud.oracle.com .

In certain embodiments cloud infrastructure system enables underlying hardware and service instances to be shared between customers or tenants. For example the database service may be provisioned as shown in in one embodiment. depicts multiple Exadata compute nodes and each providing a database instance provisioned for the database service. For example compute node provides a database instance for a database service. Each Exadata compute node may have multiple database instances.

In certain embodiments each database instance can comprise multiple schemas and the schemas may be associated with different customers or tenants. For example in database instance provides two schemas and each with its own tables. Schema may be associated with a first customer or tenant subscribing to a database service and schema may be associated with a second customer or tenant subscribing to the database service. Each tenant gets a completely isolated schema. Each schema acts like a container that can manage database objects including tables views stored procedures triggers etc. for the associated tenant. Each schema may have one dedicated tablespace with each tablespace having one data file.

In this manner a single database instance can provide database services to multiple tenants. This not only enables sharing of underlying hardware resources but also enables sharing of service instance between tenants.

In certain embodiments such a multi tenancy system is facilitated by IDM which beneficially enables multiple separate customers each having their own separate identity domains to use hardware and software that is shared in the cloud. Consequently there is no need for each customer to have its own dedicated hardware or software resources and in some cases resources that are not being used by some customers at a particular moment can be used by other customers thereby preventing those resources from being wasted. For example as depicted in a database instance can service multiple customers each with their respective identity domains. Although each such database service instance can be a separate abstraction or view of a single physical multi tenant database system that is shared among the many separate identity domains each such database service instance can have a separate and potentially different schema than each other database service instance has. Thus the multi tenant database system can store mappings between customer specified database schemas and the identity domains to which those database schemas pertain. The multi tenant database system can cause the database service instance for a particular identity domain to use the schema that is mapped to that particular identity domain.

The multi tenancy can also be extended to other services such as the Java Service. For example multiple customers can have a JAVA service instance placed within their respective identity domains. Each such identity domain can have a JAVA virtual machine which can be viewed as being a virtual slice of hardware. In one embodiment a job monitoring service e.g. Hudson can be combined with a JAVA enterprise edition platform e.g. Oracle WebLogic in the cloud to enable each separate identity domain to have its own separate virtual slice of the JAVA enterprise edition platform. Such a job monitoring service can for example monitor the execution of repeated jobs such as building a software project or jobs run by an operating system s time based job scheduler. Such repeated jobs can include the continuous building and or testing of software projects. Additionally or alternatively such repeated jobs can include the monitoring of executions of operating system run jobs that are executed on machines that are remote from the machine on which the job monitoring service executes.

In accordance with an embodiment a cloud infrastructure system can provide archival support for one or more services provided by the cloud infrastructure system. Use of cloud services results in can result in substantial portions if not all of a customer s data to be stored entirely in the cloud infrastructure. Each service a customer subscribes to may include a different subset of customer information. Archival support enables customers to retrieve copies of their information associated with each cloud service. This allows for customers to back up their data periodically save data upon termination or suspension of service and otherwise exercise control over their information. For a given service the archival process may be performed in response to certain trigger situations. For example an archival process may be executed upon the termination of a service suspension of a service upon a customer request and the like.

In certain embodiments TAS can handle both immediate de provisioning calls as well as notifications about data archive download options. TAS may capture the business level policies related to archival for a service. This may include for example the retention period for the archive e.g. 30 days corresponding customer notifications and the like. Additionally policies may be provided which define different archival options for different types of subscriptions. For example trial subscriptions may have no or limited archival support while other subscription levels may have more robust archival support including e.g. longer retention periods and archive format options.

SDI may receive the archival related policies from TAS and implement all physical and technical details of archive maintenance and access. SDI can support various archive files including but not limited to Web Application Archive WAR and Enterprise Archive EAR files. Additionally the service archive operation notifies TAS after validating that the archive meets the security requirements of the Public Cloud.

In certain embodiments SDI provides for automatic packaging of customer data either at the end of a subscription or on demand snapshot archive . Archives can be made available to customers or former customers via a variety of standard mechanisms e.g. SFTP HTTP download . SDI automates the archive data handling e.g. moving archive data to a customer accessible location . Individual services need only to produce a packaged archive such as a zip or tar file of customer data on a shared file system and indicate a location of the archive. Business policies in TAS control archive retention customer notification etc. So handling is a complete business process not just a manual FTP site.

In accordance with an embodiment the SDI can receive information about the archival request from the TAS. The SDI can identify the one or more services associated with the archival request and instruct those services using one or more service specific archive interfaces to archive any associated customer data artifacts and or other information. Each service can generate an archive and store it in an archive staging area. In accordance with an embodiment the archive staging area can be defined by the SDI prior to instructing the one or more services to archive the customer information. Each service can notify the SDI once the archival process is complete and provide the SDI with details about the archive such as the archive s location file name and file type. The SDI can then automatically move the archive from the provided location to a customer accessible location such as an SFTP server. The SDI can additionally automatically generate account credentials and log in information associated with the customer accessible location and provide the account credentials and log in information to the customer. Access to the customer accessible location and retention of the archives can be controlled by policies in the TAS. These policies can further include customer notification settings such as reminders to retrieve the archived data.

In some embodiments archives can be formatted to more readily facilitate a customer to restore a terminated or suspended service by uploading or importing the archived data.

In accordance with an embodiment the TAS module can pass the archive request information to the SDI module . The archive request information can identify each service to be archived. An archive module can use the archive request information to send an archive instruction to each identified service. The SDI module can include a plurality of service archive interfaces which can communicate archive instructions to a plurality of services provided by the cloud infrastructure system. As described above each service is responsible for archiving its customer data and storing the archive in a shared directory accessible to the SDI. Each service can communicate the information about the archive such as the archive s location name and file type to the SDI module. Alternatively the archive can be stored in a location designated by the SDI in the archive instruction. The SDI module can then retrieve each archive and move it to an archive directory . This can be a designated database tape drive or other storage device which is accessible to the customer through a customer interface such as a secure file server. Access to the archive directory by the customer can be secured using SSH FTP SFTP or other secure protocol. After the archives associated with the trigger event have been moved to the archive directory the resources in the cloud infrastructure system associated with the now archived services can be freed and made available for other customers.

In accordance with an embodiment the TAS module can monitor each archive in the archive directory. Using the archive policies stored in the archive policy module the TAS can determine whether a given archive should be retained or discarded. Each archive can be associated with a different archive policy and or each archive associated with a particular type of service can be associated with a policy associated with that service.

In accordance with an embodiment trigger events can include back up requests. These can include regularly scheduled back ups which occur periodically according to a predefined temporal pattern or on demand back ups which may occur at arbitrary intervals upon request of the customer or an administrator or other cloud infrastructure system personnel. In accordance with an embodiment back ups can be performed online or offline. An online backup refers to taking a backup while the environment is up and running Different services can be more effectively and consistently backed up under different conditions. For example database backups can be performed online with reliable results. Other services may require some operations be suspended or disabled during the back up process. An offline backup can include shutting down the environment before taking a backup including shutting down database and other server instances within a domain.

In accordance with an embodiment backups can include full backups and incremental backups. A full backup refers to taking a complete backup of a defined system or service. This backup archive is useful by itself for a restore process. An incremental backup is a backup of the difference delta between a system or service s current state and that of its last full backup or last incremental backup. Using incremental backups to restore a system or service may require additional backup archives such as past full or incremental archives.

In some embodiments one or more services and associated databases in a customer deployment may form a single logical set. This set can be backed up as a composite backup set. Such a backup can include additional data and artifacts to preserve the relationships between databases and services in the customer deployment. In accordance with an embodiment services can be backed up on a per tenant basis. For services which are single tenant in nature backup and restore can be performed on a per tenant basis. Examples include HCM and CRM. For services which are multi tenant in nature a backup can include artifacts for multiple tenants.

In accordance with an embodiment databases can be backed up in one of several ways. A full database backup backs up the entire database with no tie in into for a specific customer or his her middle tier backup. A logical level backup exports data for each customer based on their specific customer schema s . A database physical level backup can be performed if the database is architected such that each customer gets their own tablespace s each tablespace can then be backed up.

Archives for some services can include additional settings data. For example web tier services archives can include routing and security configuration data. Identity management services archives can include identity relationship information for each tenant. In accordance with an embodiment restore operations based on archives can be performed at the same level of granularity as the level of the backup done. Accordingly if a human capital management service HCM is backed up at the customer level then an individual customer can be restored.

Table 1 shows a plurality of backup artifacts which can be backed up during an archival process in accordance with an embodiment.

In accordance with an embodiment archival processes can be provided for the Java Service HCM and CRM services Web Center Connect Service Database Service and Identity Management services. Archival processes are hardware agnostic and can be used with a variety of different underlying hardware technologies.

Backup policies can be defined by each service. These policies can include details around frequency of full incremental backup scheduling of online offline backups retention period etc. Each policy can also define what credentials are required to initiate an archive process. Policies can also define particular files and file types to be backed up based on the host environment being backed up. For example Java Service Adminserver VMs may be associated with one file backup list while CRM service Managed server VMs may be associated with a different list etc. These policies can be maintained by the TAS and can be backed up at a plurality of locations throughout the cloud infrastructure system.

In accordance with an embodiment on the application tier a Java Service archive can include backups of the Adminserver Domain Home directory log directories of the Managed server Domain Home and transaction logs. A Database Service can include details about an associated Web Logic Domain and backups of the Adminserver Domain and any additional files on the file system outside of the Adminserver Domain. In accordance with an embodiment by default a managed server domain may not be backed up but can be configured to be backed up upon request. Web Center Connect archives can include backups of the Adminserver Domain Home and logs for the Managed Server Domain Home. HCM and CRM archives can include a copies of the Applications Configuration Directory managed server logs and instance data specific to each machine. Identity Management archives can include copies of the Adminserver Domain home and instance data. For Web Tier services each instance can be archived separately.

In accordance with an embodiment on the database tier each database can be backed up independently. These databases can include separate tenant specific databases for HCM and CRM applications a Web Center Connect database with a schema per tenant a database per tenant in the Java service a single database for all tenants in the database service with no isolation of the tenant specific data and one or more identity management databases. A dedicated database recovery manager application can be used for backing up each database in the database tier.

As described above the archive trigger event can include one of a request to terminate the one or more services from the customer s subscription a request to suspend the one or more services a periodically scheduled backup and an on demand backup. Additionally the archive directory can provide a secure location such as an SFTP file server from which the customer can access the archives. Each service can automatically archive and store its customer information in response to the instruction. The service can store its archive in a default location and send a message to the SDI module indicating the location of its archive. Alternatively the instruction to the services can include a location designated by the SDI module to store the archive. Further each archive can be stored in the archive directory for a predetermined period of time based on a policy associated with the archive. In accordance with an embodiment the predetermined period of time can be determined based on the customer s subscription.
