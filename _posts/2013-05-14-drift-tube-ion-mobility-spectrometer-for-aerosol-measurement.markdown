title: Drift tube ion mobility spectrometer for aerosol measurement
abstract: A drift tube ion mobility spectrometry sample introduction scheme allows introduction of a sample packet at ground voltages. The sample packet of ionized particles is captured by subjecting particles within a defined region to an electric field at an elevated voltage. The ionized particles in the captured packet then migrate through the drift tube down the voltage gradient according to their electrical mobility. The particles are directed to a high sensitivity detector, such as a condensation particle counter (CPC), for detection.

This invention was made with government support under CHE 1011810 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in the invention

The present disclosure relates generally to ion mobility spectrometry and particularly to drift tube ion mobility spectral analysis of samples containing ionized species prior to analysis.

Ion mobility spectrometers IMSs are used to measure the electrical mobility of charged molecules or particles. Currently two main types of IMS devices exist crossflow type and drift tube type.

Crossflow type IMSs are commonly used in aerosol science the most common of which are differential mobility analyzers DMAs . In DMAs ions or charged particles are introduced into a stream of gas between two parallel plates or concentric cylinders across which a voltage differential is applied. The ions or charged particles are introduced through an inlet opening at one of the plates and migrate to the opposing plate following different trajectories according to their electrical mobility which is a function of the drag coefficient. Particles within a given mobility range exit the DMA via a slit in the opposing plate. The voltage differential carrier gas flow exit slit size and location etc. may be varied to select the electrical mobility range of particles that exit the DMA. The particles exiting the DMA may be directed to an ion detector or other instrument for further analysis.

The inlet plate or cylinder of a DMA is typically grounded while the opposing plate or cylinder is typically at a negative or positive voltage. Thus charged particles may readily enter the inlet of a DMA because there is no voltage potential to overcome. Accordingly samples containing ionized species such as ambient environmental aerosols may be readily introduced into DMAs.

DMAs however have some drawbacks. First the carrier gas flow rate tends to be quite high in order to effectively separate smaller charged particles such as particles within the 1 10 nm range. In addition DMAs tend to have a low resolving power for such smaller particles.

Drift tube type IMSs DT IMSs do not tend to suffer from the drawbacks of DMAs which include low resolving power for small particles high gas flow rates and long measurement times. However DT IMSs present obstacles for aerosol measurements or sampling of particles that are charged prior to entering the DT IMS. This feature is important for sampling aerosols where the user does not wish to alter the charge distribution or in cases where a charged aerosol has been selected by an upstream tandem device. Another obstacle of DT IMSs for aerosol measurements is that DT IMSs typically employ ion detectors having a low sensitivity. Ambient aerosols have ion concentrations that are often several orders of magnitude lower than molecular ion concentrations traditionally measured with DT IMSs.

As indicated above DT IMSs are typically used for measurement of molecules or particles that are not initially charged. The uncharged molecules or particles enter a chamber across which an elevated voltage is applied. As the molecules are uncharged their entry into the chamber is not significantly impeded by the voltage difference. However particles that are charged or ionized prior to entering the chamber cannot readily cross the voltage barrier and thus cannot readily enter the chamber for analysis. Sampling of charged particles by a common DTIMS is possible through the use of a dielectric sampling port although the losses of charged particles would likely be high.

A schematic diagram that illustrates a generic DT IMS is shown in with the voltage differential across the device shown. The molecules or particles to be analyzed are introduced through inlet to enter a chamber or portion of the drift tube held at an elevated voltage. While in the chamber an ionization source is employed to ionize the particles. Once ionized the particles migrate in the drift tube down the voltage differential which is applied by a plurality of axially aligned conductive drift rings not shown . An electronic gate is typically employed to precipitate the particles until the gate is opened. The gate is opened and then closed allowing a packet of particles to enter the drift zone in which particles migrate towards a detector down the voltage differential. A carrier gas is introduced through inlet parallel to but in opposing direction of the direction of particle migration to purge the measurement region of unionized species. Particles reaching the ion detector at various times after the opening of the gate are detected and data regarding the electrical mobility of the particle which is proportional to the drift time may be collected or analyzed. As shown in the device may include an outlet for the carrier gas and may include an aperture grid upstream of the detector . Most commonly the detector of a DT IMS is a Faraday plate which tends to be insufficiently sensitive for the detection of ions or charged particles in concentrations typically found in aerosols.

Various embodiments of methods devices and systems that provide for ambient sampling of aerosols containing ionized particles in a DT IMS are described herein. A sample introduction scheme that allows introduction of a sample packet at ground voltages is described. The sample packet of ionized particles is captured by subjecting particles within a defined region to an electric field at an elevated voltage. The ionized particles in the captured packet then migrate through the drift tube down a voltage gradient at a velocity dependent upon their electrical mobility. In embodiments the particles are directed to a high sensitivity detector such as a condensation particle counter CPC for detection. CPCs may have sensitivities in the range desired for detecting particles in concentrations typically present in ambient environmental samples. Embodiments of the devices methods and systems described herein allow for fast high resolution measurement of aerosol distributions in the 2 30 nm size range which is desirable for among other things environmental monitoring process control and high throughput screening.

In embodiments described herein a method includes i introducing a sample aerosol into a drift tube of an ion mobility spectrometer and ii introducing a carrier gas into the drift tube such that at least a portion of the carrier gas flows through the drift tube in a direction generally opposing migration of ionized particles through the drift tube. The sample aerosol and carrier gas are introduced into the drift tube such that the sample aerosol circulates within the drift tube in a manner such that i a portion of the sample aerosol circulation is within a region of the drift tube to which an electrostatic field is capable of being applied for purposes of ion mobility separation and ii a portion of the sample aerosol circulation is in a portion of the drift tube in which the electrostatic field when applied effectively blocks migration of additional ions into the separation region. The method further comprises applying an electric field to the drift tube for purposes of ion mobility separation wherein the application of the electric field increases the electrical potential of ionized particles within the sample circulation in the region of the drift tube to which the electrostatic field is applied. The ionized particles to which the electric field for the purposes of ion mobility separation is applied migrate in the tube down a gradient of the applied field against the flow of the carrier gas to separate according to their ion mobility.

Another advantage that may be realized by one or more embodiments described herein is the ability to measure vapor uptake by aerosol particles introduced into the DT IMS. Such measurements are made possible because of the improved resolving power of DT IMSs relative to DMAs for small

Many of the devices articles or systems described herein may be used in a number of directions and orientations.

The present disclosure describes among other things methods devices and systems that provide for sampling of aerosols containing ionized particles in a DT IMS. Schemes that allow introduction of pre charged particles into a DT IMS are described in more detail below. Schemes that channel separated particles to a particle counter are also described in more detail below.

Referring now to an embodiment of a DT IMS is shown along with an example of voltage along the length of the drift tube which is applied via a plurality of axially aligned conductive drift rings not shown . The voltage is shown below the schematic of the device. Initially the voltage across the device may be at ground. A voltage scheme as depicted in may then be applied to capture a sample packet present with a capture zone driving ionized particles within the packet to a higher electrical potential. A gradient defining screen such as a wire mesh or the like may optionally be disposed at or near the voltage peak location to more sharply defined the profile. While not depicted or described with regard to some other embodiments described herein it will be understood that a gradient defining screen may optionally be used with these other embodiments.

It will also be understood that the applied voltage shown in or other figures presented herein may be of positive or negative polarity. The depicted voltage may be considered to represent the absolute value of the voltage. The dashed line depicted in the voltage scheme represents ground. While shown as linear it will be understood that the voltage profile may be non linear. The magnitude of the applied voltage may also change throughout the measurement time.

Once the voltage scheme is applied ionized particles migrate within the drift tube down the voltage potential to an ion detector which may be a Faraday plate positioned in the drift tube. As described in more detail below other detection schemes may be employed including schemes where the detector is located outside of the drift tube. An aperture grid or screen may be present upstream relative to flow of ionized particles of the detector .

The captured ionized particles separate within the drift zone according to their electrical mobility against a stream of carrier gas introduced at inlet . The carrier gas may exit the device at outlet . The flow of carrier gas through the inlet and outlet may be controlled to achieve desired flow characteristics such as laminar flow within the drift zone .

Aerosol samples are introduced through inlet in a circulating pattern near a point in the device where the electrostatic field in the direction of the axis of the drift tube is at zero even when the voltage is applied as will be described in more detail below with regard to . While only one inlet is shown it will be understood that in the various embodiments described herein more than one inlet may be present and may be used to achieve desired flow and circulation. The flow of the carrier gas that is introduced at inlet helps define the circulatory pattern of the sample. At the start of analysis the voltage is applied to the electrodes e.g. drift rings not shown and only aerosol particles that are downstream relative to flow of ionized particles in drift tube when voltage applied i.e. from direction of inlet to detector of the zero electrostatic potential gradient region are captured and subjected to IMS separation through the drift zone . Once the voltage is applied charged species in the sample will not enter the capture zone due to the voltage barrier. The voltage may be returned to ground and voltage scheme reapplied to capture another sample packet.

Sample introduction shown in is gateless. Such a gateless introduction is possible because the capture zone can be well defined by controlling flows of the carrier gas and the sample aerosol. Thus the captured sample packet that is subjected to separation according to electrical mobility is geometrically restricted and may not in some cases significantly adversely affect resolving power.

Of course it is possible to employ a gate in a DT IMS as described herein. For example and with reference to an example of a DT IMS that includes a gate is shown. The device in is similar to the device shown in with like numbers referring to like components regions or the like. As with the device in the device in is configured to allow sample introduction into capture zone at zero voltage. A loading voltage V is then applied e.g. as depicted below the device schematic to increase the electrical potential of charged particles within capture zone which migrate down the drift tube until they reach the electronic gate . The gate may be opened to allow a packet of ionized sample particles to enter the drift zone and then closed. Once in the drift zone particles migrate in the drift tube against the flow of carrier gas down the voltage potential V . Timing of particle detection at detector may then be correlated to timing of opening of gate as is currently done with most DT IMS devices. An advantage of this configuration is that the drift field does not abruptly change at the start of a sample which may cause adverse effects on certain detectors such as Faraday plate electrometers. Of course the use of separate capture and separation voltages may be employed with or without an electronic gate.

Referring now to a reverse field e.g. ground at the inlet and higher voltage at the detector may also be used to introduce charged samples into the drift zone . In such cases an electronic gate such as described above may be desirable to introduce packets of sample. In the embodiment depicted in the gate may be placed in proximity to the inlet . In this case the capture zone not shown in which is located upstream of the gate is not as dependent on the flow pattern of analyte into the tube . Any aerosol that i enters through the inlet ii is captured by the electric field which may extend to the inlet and iii passes the gate may serve as analyte.

In embodiments such as those depicted in a detector that is not significantly adversely affected by such voltages is preferably employed. One of skill in the art will understand that Faraday plate detectors and condensation particle counters CPCs can in theory be operated at high voltage.

While not shown it will be understood that a DT IMS as described herein may include an ionization source to ionize sample particles within drift tube. While the aerosol sample entering the drift tube may already contain charged particles it may be desirable to further ionize the particles to obtain a sample with standardized particle ion distribution. The ionization source may be positioned in or upstream relative to ion drift of the capture zone. Of course the ionization may also take place upstream of inlet.

Referring now to simulated sample flow path lines and electrostatic potential contours in a portion of a drift tube around the capture zone is shown. As depicted the drift tube includes a plurality of axially aligned drift tube rings separated by spacers. When a voltage is applied to the rings electrostatic potential contours as shown may result. In the depicted drawing the electrostatic potential contours range from 0V up to the applied operating voltage. Only aerosol sample ion particles that are to the right of the zero gradient region generally those particles within the capture zone will be subjected to ion mobility separation in the drift tube .

Referring now to in which a device similar to the device in is shown the device may include a diffuser to assist in achieving the desired circulation pattern of the sample that is introduced through inlet . The geometry and position of the diffuser the geometry of the drift tube the rate of flow of the sample and the rate of flow of the carrier gas may all affect the circulation pattern of the sample flow and each may be readily varied by those of skill in the art to obtain a sample flow pattern with a defined capture zone at an appropriate point relative to an electric field when applied such as depicted in .

Referring now to a DT IMS device in which a detector is located external to the drift tube is shown. In the depicted embodiment ionized particles that separate as they migrate towards the end of the drift tube are carried by a stream of carrier gas through a conduit . In embodiments the carrier gas that carries the separated ion particles through the conduit to the detector is also the carrier gas that serves as the drift gas for the ion mobility separation. The carrier gas is introduced through inlet . The drift tube conduit and inlet are configured and the gas flow controlled to achieve carrier gas flow that allows the carrier gas to serve as both the drift gas and the carrier gas through the conduit.

By way of example and with reference to a schematic image of a flow path lines in a portion of a DT IMS in which ionized particles are directed towards a detector is shown. The sample flow path lines are shown generally in the center. Preferably the sample flow is directed to conduit at a point at which the sample is no longer under the influence of voltage driven migration. As shown a flow diffuser may be employed to facilitate desired flow paths. In embodiments the carrier gas is introduced through the inlet at a flow rate that equals the detector flow plus the drift gas flow.

In embodiments particles are focused in the drift tube via application of a non linear electric field along the length of the drift tube. Such focusing of particles may be advantageous when an external detector is used e.g. as discussed above with regard to e.g. where it is advantageous or desirable to focus particles to a limited region or area of the drift tube. It should be understood that such focusing of charged particles particularly in aerosols may be useful in applications other than just DT IMS. For example a drift tube may be used with or without counter flow of carrier gas to focus particles for further analysis in nearly any suitable system.

With regard to DT IMS particle trajectory simulations show that a significant portion of sampled aerosol may be deposited on the ground electrode grounded diffuser at the end of the drift region versus being drawn into the detector when an external detector is employed . This effect is in some ways beneficial in that the particles that are ultimately sampled have experienced a more uniform drag force from the drift gas leading to better resolution. For low number concentration aerosols where resolution is not as critical the aerosol can be focused by exploiting the Poisson Laplace equation in the absence of spatial charge 0 1 where V is the voltage potential. The Laplacian can be written in cylindrical coordinates 

Equation 8 shows that when the magnitude of Eis increasing along the axis then there is a corresponding gradient E r that is acting radially in the opposite direction pushing ions towards the center of the drift region .

In the embodiments discussed above the drift voltage is described as being generally on or off instantaneously or nearly instantaneously. However it will be understood that the voltage may be ramped stepped or otherwise changed from off to on. Simulations have shown that for a given drift voltage ions with a high drift velocity relative to the drift gas velocity are not efficiently sampled. Conversely if the ion drift velocity is on the same order as the drift gas velocity the laminar flow profile can negatively impact overall resolution. In order to efficiently sample ions across a wide range of mobilities the drift voltage may be ramped stepped or otherwise changed throughout the analysis such that high mobility ions are sampled under a low field low drift velocity at the early part of the ramp and ions with lower mobility spend a significant portion of their measurement time at a suitably high drift velocity. Laboratory experiments in the context of a test system described herein have shown that ramping linearly from 500V to 9 kV over a span of 20 seconds provides a much more uniform sampling efficiency.

Transmission efficiency measurements of the DTIMS show a dependence on particle size and drift voltage as shown in .

The losses of small particles at high drift voltages are attributed to the increased drift velocity near the detector inlet causing a higher fraction of particles to precipitate at the end of the drift region opposed to being aspirated by the detector. The reduced transmission efficiency for large particles at low drift flows are likely due to the longer drift times and associated diffusion losses to the walls of the device. This effect can be reduced by ramping stepping or otherwise changing the drift voltage from a low value to a higher value linearly non linearly or by some other time dependence throughout the measurement.

As shown in the transmission efficiency for small particles is improved by voltage ramping as is the uniformity of transmission efficiency vs. size. Further improvement should be achievable by those of skill in the art by manipulation of the ramping scheme.

The DT IMS devices and methods described herein include DT IMS with or without gating with an applied electric field that is linear non linear time invariant time variant with a voltage profile that is linear non linear time invariant or time variant or combinations thereof.

Referring now to a schematic cross sectional diagram of an embodiment of a DT IMS similar to the device depicted in is shown. The device may employ one or more principles discussed above e.g. flow rate and geometric control for sample packet capture application of voltage to capture sample packet application of voltage contours for focusing ramping or stepping to increase transmission frequency etc. The device depicted in contains a sample inlet flow outlet an inlet diffuser a screen drift rings an exit diffuser a flow inlet and a detector inlet . In the depicted embodiments the drift zone has a length of 224 mm Of course the drift zone may have any suitable length or other dimension. A gradient defining screen such as screen depicted in may be included in any of the embodiments disclosed herein where suitable or desirable. The screen serves to provide a sharp electromagnetic edge to the packet introduced into the drift tube.

Referring now to block diagrams of various systems employing a DT IMS as described herein are shown. The DT IMS may be coupled to an ion or particle detector which may be located within the drift tube or external to the drift tube. In embodiments the detector is a condensation particle counter CPC such as a TSI Model 3786 CPC or 3788 WCPC. CPCs typically have high ion detection sensitivity often allowing counting of single particles.

In embodiments the DT IMS may be placed in tandem with an upstream particle selector . In embodiments the upstream particle selector is a DMA device such as nDMA device e.g. TSI model 3085 which will feed particles of a preselected size range into DT IMS for analysis of size shifts due to aerosol modification between the DMA and the DT IMS. In embodiments the particles are in the range from about 1 nanometer to about 100 nanometers such as from about 2 nanometers to about 30 nanometers. The ions or charged particles exiting the DMA may be modified in size charge state morphology or chemical composition by an appropriate reaction cell prior to introduction to the drift tube inlet. Of course the drift tube may serve as a reaction cell in which size charge state morphology or chemical composition etc. may be modified regardless of whether the system includes an upstream DMA.

An aerosol generation system such as an electrospray aerosol generator furnace or aerosol nebulizer may be placed upstream of the DT IMS to produce sample aerosols for introduction to the DT IMS or upstream particle separator . However when ambient aerosols are to be sampled the use of an aerosol generation system may be omitted.

Referring now to a schematic block diagram of a tandem nano DMA nDMA DT IMS CPC system in accordance with embodiments described herein. As depicted the system includes a furnace to generate aerosol particles a nDMA a DT IMS and a CPC . A system as depicted in where the DT IMS was generally as depicted in was used in initial characterization as described herein below in the EXAMPLES.

In the following non limiting examples are presented which describe various embodiments of the articles systems and methods discussed above.

A measurement system that is able to measure deliquescence efflorescence and hygroscopic growth of particles down to 2 nm is proposed. The system makes use of a high resolution differential mobility analyzer in tandem with an ion mobility spectrometer IMS designed for use with charged aerosols. The advantages of this system include high resolution low vapor consumption and reduced diffusional losses. A prototype IMS coupled to a condensation particle counter CPC has been constructed and the device has shown good linearity response and high resolving power compared to existing technology. Further modifications to the device are described that should improve resolving power. The system may be used to measure among other things water vapor and particle interactions for furnace generated NaCl and NH SOaerosols for sizes ranging from 2 20 nm. These results may be compared to existing experimental results for particles greater than 5.5 nm and to models for particles smaller than 5.5 nm where no experimental data exists.

The Earth s atmosphere consists of an aerosol solids and or liquids suspended in a gas containing particles of different sizes shapes compositions and concentrations. Understanding the properties of particles in atmospheric aerosols is necessary to determine the role they play in the environment including cloud formation as cloud condensation nuclei and haze. Aerosol particles interact with vapors in different ways based on the properties of the particles and the composition of the gas. The interactions of interest to this work are adsorption where vapor molecules are present on the surface of the particle and adsorption where the vapor molecules are present throughout the particle.

Previous research has shown that some atmospheric particles vary in size as a function of the relative humidity of the aerosol due to hygroscopic growth with or without deliquescence and efflorescence. Hygroscopic growth is a phenomenon where a particle swells to an increasing size as a function of the relative humidity. Deliquescence is described by a sudden jump in a particle diameter at a given relative humidity where a particle changes from a solid core with a saturated liquid shell to a saturated liquid solution. This deliquescence relative humidity DRH is based on the composition temperature size and structure of the dry particle. Efflorescence is the reverse of deliquescence where nucleation of the solute in a saturated liquid particle occurs and the particle then shifts to a smaller size. Efflorescence occurs at a certain relative humidity ERH which is lower than the DRH.

Deliquescence occurs when the Gibbs free energy of the solid core saturated shell is equal to the saturated solution. For given vapor and particle compositions the DRH and ERH are constant as a function of size for particles greater than 100 nm. For particles less than 100 nm the Kelvin effect becomes important. The Kelvin effect takes into account the work done by the change in the surface area at a given surface tension. This effect raises both the DRH and ERH. For particles less than 3 nm the surface tension deviates from bulk value adding a correction to the particle vapor pressure defined by the Kelvin effect. Several models exist to describe the deliquescence behavior of nanoparticles. These theories in general agree with experimental data although there is currently no experimental data to support the models below 5.5 nm.

Techniques for measuring deliquescence and hygroscopic growth of aerosol particles include Tandem Differential Mobility Analysis TDMA Atomic Force Microscopy AFM Electro Dynamic Balances EDB Raman Spectroscopy Ion Mobility Spectroscopy Mass Spectrometry IMSMS and Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy E SEM . The TDMA technique has been able to measure the size effects on DRH and ERH to the smallest sizes down to 5.5 nm. TDMA consists of three major components. The first is a differential mobility analyzer DMA that is used to select a near monodisperse charged particle size based on the electrical mobility Zof the particles. A particle s electrical mobility is a function of the particle diameter number of charges and gas properties as shown in Equation 9.

A limitation of the TDMA technique for measuring the DRH and ERH of nanoparticles is the transmission efficiency of the system. As the size of the particle decreases the diffusion coefficient increases according to Einstein s relation. The increased diffusion coefficient leads to increased losses to the walls of the humidification evaporation section and the transfer tubing as well as causing increased broadening of the diameters selected by the first DMA. Additional experimental errors arise from the fact that DMA selected aerosol is not truly monodisperse. The variability in the diameters present can lead to bi modal deliquescence and complications in interpreting the data. The minimum detected size for the detector used after the second DMA is also a limitation for the system.

A desired system for measuring the deliquescence of nanometer scale particles may have the following features 

For this work a novel measurement system is proposed that will enable measurement of deliquescence and hygroscopic growth of particles down to 2 nm by addressing limitations of current systems.

To address several of the goals of the measurement system a novel application of a drift tube type ion mobility spectrometer is proposed for the reaction region and downstream mobility spectrometer. In Ion Mobility Spectroscopy IMS charged particles ions are introduced at one end of a tube in a packet that is created by an electric gate device. The ions then travel in the direction of a constant axial electric field and reach the other end of the tube at different times based on their electrical mobility Z.

The advantages of ion mobility spectrometers include high resolving power can exceed 100 low drift gas volume and separation of the particles from the carrier aerosol into the drift gas at the start of the mobility separation. The fact that the ions spend the majority of the drift time in the drift gas allows for the spectrometer to be used as the reaction region. Since the electric field is constant it also simplifies any corrections required for non negligible reaction times. Disadvantages of existing ion mobility spectrometers include low sensitivity due to the use of an electrometer as the ion detector. Additionally the shutter mechanism in ion mobility spectrometers require the ions to pass through an array of wires which leads to losses of ions through diffusional deposition. Current IMS technology does not allow sampling of pre charged ions which makes their application in tandem configurations not possible without modification to the sample introduction technique. Design of a IMS for this application including modifications to address the limitations of traditional IMS operation is discussed below.

Design of a prototype ion mobility spectrometer utilized simulation tools to map particle trajectories fluid flow and electrostatic fields. These simulation tools along with analytical expressions for determining resolving power t twere used to determine the geometry of the prototype device and to determine what parameters affected the overall resolving power. The analytical expression used to calculate the resolving power is given by Equation 10

Where tis the half width of the input pulse time V is the drift tube voltage e is the unit charge z in the number of charges k is Boltzmann s constant T is temperature and tis the drift time. This equation shows that the resolving power is independent of particle mobility and increases only with voltage. Fluid flow and electrostatic fields were modeled in Fluent software and particle paths were modeled using a user defined function in Fluent and using code written in Fortran. Both programs applied the Langevin equation to define particle trajectories given by Equation 11. 11 

Where is the friction factor particle mass and X is the random force. The Fortran code applied an algorithm to solve the Langevin equation using an algorithm given by Ermak and Buckholtz. shows simulation results for several different voltages drift tube flowrates and drift lengths. All of the simulations used particle diameters of 7.8 nm drift tube diameter at 4 cm and the flow profile modeled as fully developed laminar. The simulations did not model a timed gate but instead modeled randomly selected starting points in a packet 1 cm in length and 2 cm diameter at the start of the electric field. This length can be converted to pulse time using t x ZE where Zis the electrical mobility of the particle E is the electric field and xis the packet length. The device length can be converted to drift time using a similar equation where td L ZpE where L is the drift tube length.

The simulation results verify the change in resolving power t t with varying drift tube length with values near 20 for the shorter tube and near 40 for the longer for similar field strength and low drift gas to ion drift velocity ratios . The simulations also show that increasing the drift tube flowrate causes the resolving power to drop. To investigate the cause of the reduced resolving power the model was run using a plug flow profile. shows that peak broadening increases at a lower rate using plug flow which confirms that the source of broadening is due to the variability in the flow velocity in the radial direction for fully developed laminar flow. In order to reduce this effect in an instrument design either the sample can be confined towards the center of the tube or the drift velocity must me considerably greater than the gas velocity.

A goal of this device is to have high ion detection sensitivity. To achieve this a condensation particle counter device CPC TSI Model 3786 was used as the detector. The major advantage of this type of detector is the ability to count single particles. Disadvantages include needing to be operated near atmospheric pressure particle size sensitivity detection of 50 of particles at 2.5 nm and upper concentration limit of 100 000 particles cm specifications from instrument brochure . The response time of the CPC can lead to broadening of peaks whose time constants and drift delay times are similar to that of the CPC. Inside the device the detector sampling port was designed to minimize disturbance of the field and to maximize transport of ions to the inlet. Additionally the detector requires a sample flow in contrast to the faraday cups used in commercial IMS devices. To address this a gas is introduced at the end of the drift tube at a flowrate that is equal to the detector flow plus the drift gas flow. shows flow pathlines of the drift and detector gas in red and pathlines of 10 nm particles in blue.

To address diffusional losses in a sample gate a gateless sample introduction scheme can be used. In this configuration the aerosol is introduced in a circulating pattern near a point in the device where the electrostatic field in the axial direction is at zero. At the start of analysis the voltage is applied to the electrodes and only aerosol particles that are downstream of the zero point are sampled. shows the sample flow pathlines superimposed on the electrostatic field. Note that the edge of the electrostatic field contours indicates the zero field boundary. In the drift tube capture zone and spacers and that separate axially aligned rings not shown are labeled.

An overall schematic of the device is shown in . The instrument utilized a modified uni polar charger UPC device for the electrodes and main housing. Modifications to the UPC included the inlet and exit diffusers and the mounts for the sample inlet and detector. The diffusers consist of open cell acoustic foam mounted onto custom fabricated plastic alignment pieces to center the tubes on each end.

The two main performance features of a viable IMS CPC is the linearity of the drift time to particle Zacross different operating conditions and resolving power. The linearity experiments used NaCl particles generated using a tube furnace with an aerosol flow rate ranging from 1 2 liter minute. The aerosol generator utilized a recirculating quench gas flow at 3 liter minute. The aerosol was then passed through an aerosol neutralizer containing a Po 210 radioactive source. The neutralizer gives the test aerosol a known charge distribution allowing for electrical mobility separation. Aerosol particles were mobility selected using a TSI Model 3085 NanoDMA with a sheath flowrate of 15 liters per minute lpm and a sample flowrate of 0.6 lpm unless specified. The instrument flowrates for the majority of the experiments are shown in Table 1. The given flows resulted in a drift gas flow rate of 0.2 lpm and a drift velocity of 0.0052 meter second along the centerline. The drift gas flow rate was chosen arbitrarily. The error in the drift flow rate is 5 if the errors in the detector flows are assumed to be 1 each. A diagram of the experimental setup is shown in .

To investigate the linearity of the device the peak drift time was measured for several different mobilities. The temperature of the tube furnace was adjusted for each calibration point and the selected mobility was set at the peak mobility leaving the furnace. This was done to minimize errors in the peak mobility that can occur when the input aerosol to a DMA has a sloping variability in mobility. The results from the linearity experiments are shown in . The data show Rvalues greater than 99 for the conditions tested.

High resolution mobility spectrometers typically use high molecular weight ions as the standard for measuring resolving power. Unfortunately the condensation particle counter used in the device is unable to detect these ions. Due to this limitation the resolving power was investigated by varying the IMS sample inlet flow rate effectively shortening the introduced sample length. For the sample inlet flow experiments the NanoDMA sample flowrate was fixed at 1.0 lpm to keep the sample aerosol consistent. In general the resolving powers of DMAs are equivalent to the flow ratios when particle diffusion can be neglected although others showed that the maximum resolving power approaches about 17 D. R. Chen and D. Y. H. Pui A High Efficiency High Throughput Unipolar Aerosol Charger for Nanoparticles vol. 1 pp. 115 126 1999 . The results shown in indicate that the resolving power of the device varies strongly with the sample flowrate which effectively changes the sample length . For the lowest sample inlet flow i.e. shortest length the resolving power is measured at 11.1 using a detector delay time of 1 second and the resolving power of the DMA is estimated to be less than 15. This implies qualitatively that the resolving power of the IMS is considerably higher than the NanoDMA resolving power.

The results of the preliminary research show the feasibility of this device for measuring mobility distributions of aerosols and provides a basis for continuing research.

Further optimization of the geometry and operating conditions including modifications to the sample introduction scheme voltage scheme etc. may be readily made by those of skill in the art upon reading the disclosure presented herein. Simulations that include analytical solutions to the mobility distributions resulting from the particle transfer function of this device in a tandem measurement system may be used for purposes of optimization. The resolving power of the device and measurement of DRH ERH and hygroscopic growth of nanometer scale particles among other things may be investigated. Some discussion of additional simulations and optimization that may be performed are discussed below.

While the gateless sample introduction is helpful for limiting diffusional losses the zero field contour is not flat in the radial direction and the gradient near the boundary is not sharp see . These two drawbacks lead to size dependent resolution and overall lower resolution. The size dependent resolution stems from the idea that particles with lower mobilities will require a stronger E field to overcome the drift gas flow than lower mobility particles. The non flat contour leads to a wider variability in particle starting points i.e. longer sample length which proportionally affects the resolving power. To address this issue a wire mesh is placed across the tube to help define a sharper sample packet. The additional diffusion losses due to the screen may be considered in the transfer function calculation. Additional modeling and experimental work may be done to minimize the drift tube flow rate. shows the pathline and field contours when a screen is present.

For such a device to provide useful results it may be important to map the probability distribution of measured mobility for a given input mobility. Variances in the measured mobility arise from size dependent diffusional losses diffusional broadening DMA transfer function IMS sample introduction length and diffusion broadening and detector time constants. The resulting transfer function preferably provides for a given measurement time the distribution of mobilities being detected. The mathematical representation of an overall transfer function is shown in equation 12.

Where n Z is the input aerosol concentration. Where Z Q L is the penetration through a sample tube length L at a flow rate Q. Where Z is the transfer function of the DMA where is the ratio of sample to sheath flows. The diffusional losses between the DMA and the start of the drift region are Z Q L and Z Q respectively. The two penetrations are found using different equations and are therefore separated. The Z n term accounts for vapor particle reactions where nis the vapor concentration. The reaction term assumes that all particles are spherical and of the same composition and charge state. The IMS contribution is given by Z V t where V is the drift tube voltage and tis the sample pulse time i.e. the sample length. The penetration and diffusional broadening of the detector is given by Z t . The detector introduces two mobility dependent errors one is due to mobility dependent diffusional losses to the tube walls and the other is axial diffusion down the length of the device which leads to time dependent errors. The equations that may be used to define each of the transfer function terms are described below 

Where tis the half width of the input pulse V is the drift tube voltage e is the unit charge z in the number of charges k is Boltzmann s constant T is temperature and td is the drift time. The drift time td is given by L vwhere vis given by ZE and E is V L. This simplifies to t L ZPV where L is the drift length and V is the voltage. The resolving power is given by t t. shows a plot of estimated resolving power and drift time for the prototype device operated at different voltages.

If the tis assumed to be a fixed length versus a time then the resolving power is constant for all mobilities. For L 0.225 m and x 0.005 m at 10 kV the resulting resolving power is 44 if diffusion in the detector is neglected. This leads to a desired gating scheme that does not alter the sample packet length as a function of mobility i.e. shutters particles that are traveling at a low velocity e.g. carried with the sample gas. The drift gas velocity can be neglected for high mobility particles but for the operating parameters described above at 20 nm the drift velocity approaches 25 of the drift gas counterflow velocity. The t equation with this correction is given in Equation 18. It can be seen from this equation that increased drift velocity will lead to increased t therefore a lower resolving power. Note that this equation assumes plug flow. Additional broadening will arise if a fully developed flow profile is considered. This effect is shown in the simulation results in .

The transfer function of the system can be applied to two cases generation of molecular ions of a single mobility and sampling from a polydisperse input aerosol. For the molecular ion case since the drift time is a linear function of Zthe transfer function is a Gaussian with Z m t where is the half width and m is the slope of the calibration curve. If the drift gas is neglected and the voltage error is considered to be 1 and the length error is considered to be 1 due to errors in x0 then the error in peak mobility is 1.4 . In cases where the input aerosol is polydisperse the system transfer function must consider the transfer function of the first DMA. An analytical expression for the system transfer function may be determined as part of the proposed work. This analytical expression may include variables that can be used to fit experimental data to the analytical expression. These variables may account for imperfections in the device including flow variability sample shape DMA imperfections and others. The analytical expression can ultimately be used to iteratively determine the input aerosol distribution based on the output results.

The limitations for resolving power and minimum particle size are affected by the detector properties and it may be desirable to develop a fast mixing condensation particle counter that is able to achieve high saturation ratios of the working fluid. The time response performance goals for the device would be similar to a CPC developed by Flagan and co workers. The target minimum detected size may be for example less than 1 nm which has been previously achieved with a mixing type CPC. The analytical expression for the transfer function may be used to determine the necessary detector properties. Measurement of these properties is discussed in the experimental section.

The experimental work for this device may include verification of the resolving power and transfer function. Application experiments may include measurement of mobility shifts due to vapor adsorption and absorption for various combinations of particle materials sizes and vapor concentrations.

The resolving power of an IMS device increases with operating voltage as shown in . The maximum operating voltage is limited by geometry in the case of arcing and by the response time of the detector as the voltage increases the value for t decreases . Experiments to measure the resolving power of the device may be done using Tetra Alkyl molecular ions generated via electrospray. These compounds are beneficial since they produce ions of a single mobility. The disadvantage is they are too small to be seen by conventional condensation particle counters unpublished data by McMurry group . The detectors that are able to see these ions include faraday cage type electrometers and a diethylene glycol CPC that was developed by the McMurry group at the University of Minnesota. A fast response electrometer that utilizes electrostatic precipitation of the ions may be developed for use in these experiments. To determine the response time characteristics of potential detectors an electrostatic precipitator may be fabricated that may be able to rapidly change the aerosol concentration at the detector inlet. Results from these experiments may give the delay time and the time constant of the detectors. These values can be used to determine the theoretical resolving power of the IMS coupled to each detector.

The resolving power measurements may be performed at several IMS operating voltages and inlet flow rates i.e. initial sample length . These data can then be used to back out the value that can be used for t. These data can then be used to fit constants that were determined for the analytical expression for the system transfer function excluding the first DMA. Additional experiments may then be run using polydisperse aerosol generated via a tube furnace. The results may then be used to determine the correction constants in the first DMA. The correction constants may be compared to previously published data for the DMA.

One proposed application of this device is to measure the adsorption of vapors onto the surface of particles in the range of 2 20 nm. The advantages of using this device over previous technology include high resolving power at low sheath drift gas flow rates and a nearly instant exposure to the vapor at the start of mobility separation. The experimental measurements that may be performed may measure the shift in mobility of particles at varying water vapor concentrations. The particle materials may include furnace generated NaCl and NH SOutilizing a conditioning system that cause the particles to deliquesce and effloresce prior to sampling ensuring the particles consist of a single crystal. The furnace generated aerosol reduces errors due to particle contamination seen in nebulized source aerosols. The vapor concentrations may be set using a humidity control system developed for the NanoTDMA system at the University of Minnesota. Experiments may focus on measurement of the relative humidity at the point of deliquescence for NaCl and NH SOand the results may be compared to values that have been measured by several researchers. Measurements of sizes smaller than 6 nm may be compared to theories developed by Russell and Ming L. M. Russell and Y. Ming Deliquescence of small particles vol. 116 pp. 311 321 Jan. 1 2002 and McGraw and Lewis R. McGraw and E. R. Lewis Deliquescence and efflorescence of small particles vol. 131 Nov. 21 2009 and to molecular dynamics simulations done by Russell and Bahadur R. Bahadur and L. M. Russell Water uptake coefficients and deliquescence of NaCl nanoparticles at atmospheric relative humidities from molecular dynamics simulations 129 Sep. 7 2008 . These experiments require that equilibrium is quickly reached in the device and the results will indicate if errors due to equilibration time can be neglected or show that an additional correction is needed or desired. To investigate this the measurements may be made at several drift voltages. Changes in the measured mobility diameter may indicate a reaction time dependence. Molecular dynamics simulations of deliquescence show that the time to reach equilibrium ranges from 1 to 65 s for NaCl particles 1 11 nm in diameter which is short compared to the theoretical drift times which are on the order of ms.

The results of these experiments and the development of this device will be valuable for researchers investigating growth of freshly nucleated atmospheric aerosols due to adsorption of water vapor. They may also provide the first opportunity to test deliquescence models down to 2 nm.

A device that is able to measure the electrical mobility of aerosols with high resolving power across a wide range of mobilities has been developed and initial experimental data show that the performance of the device is near what is theoretically expected. Modifications that may improve the device performance include an alternate sample introduction technique modification of voltage schemes and minimization of the detector response time. A transfer function for the device in a tandem arrangement was shown and a solution to the function is proposed herein. Experiments for the device may focus on measurement of the shift in particle mobility due to the absorption and adsorption of water vapor onto particles as a function of the vapor concentration particle size and particle composition. These data may be taken for a smaller size range than previously investigated and compared to models for predicted behavior.

The prototype DT IMS was used to measure the electrical mobility of Bovine Serum Albumin particles generated via electrospray ionization TSI . The measured mobility distribution can be compared to published measurements made using a High Resolution Differential Mobility Analyzer HR DMA and measurements made using a Nano Differential Mobility Analyzer nDMA TSI . The results from the nDMA measurements are shown in .

To demonstrate the speed of the device measurements of electrosprayed Myoglobin were made at different drift voltages. shows mobility measurements made at 10 and 1 kV. shows the same data with the time axis normalized to the 1 kV scan. For comparison the nDMA results shown above had a 120 second scan time. The HR DMA scan times were on the order of 300 seconds.

Initial tests show that as the measurement time is reduced the resolving power of the instrument decreases. Theoretically the opposite is true. We suspect the observed loss of resolution is due to the long response time of the CPC used TSI compared to the time between peaks. A faster detector may be able to better resolve the peaks at low scan times.

A new drift tube type Ion Mobility Spectrometer DT IMS has been designed and may be particularly useful for aerosol particle measurements from ambient environments. DT IMS devices allow for determination of the electrical mobility of a charged particle through measurement of the time necessary for a particle to travel a fixed distance through a tube in the presence of an electrostatic gradient. These instruments have traditionally been limited to measurements of ionized molecules and small 1 nm charged clusters. Previously developed devices are not able to sample charged aerosol particles from the ambient because of the high electric fields present at the beginning of the drift region. An additional limitation of existing DT IMS devices is the low sensitivity of the Faraday Cup Electrometers at concentrations found in typical aerosols. Conversely DT IMS devices have the advantages of mobility invariant high resolving power R 10 20 low drift gas flow rates compared to DMA sheath gas flowrates and shorter measurement times as compared to most scanning differential mobility analyzers.

The modifications to traditional DT IMS devices that facilitated application for ambient aerosol measurement include a novel gateless sample introduction scheme and the ability to couple to an aspirating Condensation Particle Counter CPC which can detect single particles. The gateless sample introduction in embodiments uses a combination of a controlled flow path and stepped voltage at the start of a measurement to effectively select a packet of aerosol. Additional aerosol does not enter the sample region after the start of a measurement due to the presence of an electrostatic field. The coupling to a CPC in embodiments includes a controlled flow that splits to provide the drift gas and the gas aspirated by the CPC. A prototype device was built and has been tested. The device has a linear relationship between drift time and mobility and a resolving power greater than 10. Measurements of proteins show good peak separation and compare well to DMA measurements.

Previous DT IMS designs were unable to sample charged particles and require high ion concentrations. In contrast the DT IMS devices systems and methods described herein allow for sampling of charged particles at relatively low concentrations.

In embodiments described herein a sample inlet is provided where aerosol may be continuously introduced to the inlet. An electric field is applied at start of measurement and packet of aerosol is selected. Drift gas removes stray particles from the drift region and the field prevents additional aerosol from entering drift region. Inlet flow rate may be modified to adjust the length of aerosol packet. Shorter packets improve resolving power. Longer packets increase sensitivity.

In embodiments described herein the end of the drift region is coupled to aspirating detector. Particle counts time is synced with the start of the application of the field. Drift gas is introduced with the aspirated supply flow. Vapors can be added to the drift gas to study vapor uptake by particles.

Using a system as shown in and a DT IMS as shown in with the following operating parameters inlet flow 800 or 600 cm min drift flow 200 cm min detector flow 600 cm min good linearity R 0.998 for particles up to 6 nm for a wide range of drift voltages was observed. Calibration was dependent on detector. It was found that linearity suffers at long drift times. However higher drift voltages show good linearity to 20 nm see e.g. .

With the prototype system used herein it was found that DMA resolving power was the limiting factor for slow scans low drift voltage while the detector response time was the limiting factor for fast scans. The width of CPC detection time distribution was found to affect the resolving power which was more apparent at faster scan times.

It was found that the transmission of particles varies with voltage and mobility and that calibration may be used to correct. It was also found that higher drift voltages favor transmission of larger particles.

Thus embodiments of DRIFT TUBE ION MOBILITY SPECTROMETER FOR AEROSOL MEASUREMENT are disclosed. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the articles systems and methods described herein can be practiced with embodiments other than those disclosed. The disclosed embodiments are presented for purposes of illustration and not limitation.
