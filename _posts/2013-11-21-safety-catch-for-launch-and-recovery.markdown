This is a division of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 071 075 filed Mar. 28 2011 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 590 473 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application 61 365 800 filed Jul. 20 2010 both of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The following description was made in the performance of official duties by employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the claimed invention may be manufactured used licensed by or for the United States Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.

The following description relates generally to a locking safety catch attachable to a water vessel for launching and recovery operations on an inclined surface the locking safety catch working in conjunction with a notched groove in the inclined surface to prevent rollback of the water vessel.

The recovery of smaller surface water vessels such as manned or unmanned surface water vessels USVs by larger parent ships or on land structures is an emerging technology. Once recovered by the parent ship servicing operations such as fueling and general maintenance may be performed. Traditionally the recovery of a smaller vessel is accomplished by driving the smaller vessel alongside a stationary parent ship or structure and lifted by davit into the ship or structure. Alternatively the smaller water vessel may be driven up a ramp into the larger ship. Ramps are also used to facilitate launching operations where the manned or unmanned surface water vessels are launched into the water.

In launch and recovery operations the water vessel is typically captured by rope or lanyards attached to the parent ship or structure. There are inherent risks associated with the launch and recovery of water vessels up and down ramps. Water vessels may be manned or unmanned aluminum boats that weigh about 20 000 lbs. Any uncontrolled slippage of a water vessel during a launch or recovery operation places operators at jeopardy and may result in damage to the water vessel or the parent ship or the structure on which the water vessel is loaded. The prior art does not teach an operator friendly apparatus that prevents rollback and the adverse effects associated with the rollback of vessels being launched or recovered.

In one aspect the invention is a safety catch. The safety catch includes a mounting bracket and a first support member attached to the mounting bracket. The safety catch also includes a second support member attached to the mounting bracket with the first and second support members forming a groove therebetween. In this aspect the safety catch also includes a catch arm pivotally attached to each of the first support member and the second support member. The catch arm is positioned within the groove and is pivotable between a wedged position and a released position.

In another aspect the invention is a water vessel arrangement for preventing rollback during launch or recovery operations. In this aspect the invention includes a water vessel having a transom surface and at least one safety catch attached to the transom. The at least one safety catch includes a mounting bracket attached to the transom surface and a first support member attached to the mounting bracket. The at least one safety catch also includes a second support member attached to the mounting bracket with the first and second support members forming a groove therebetween. The at least one safety catch also includes a catch arm pivotally attached to each of the first support member and the second support member with the catch arm positioned within the groove and pivotable between a wedged position and a released position.

In another aspect the invention is an arrangement to prevent rollback on an inclined surface. The arrangement includes an inclined surface for launching or retrieving a water vessel with the inclined surface having one or more notched grooves. In this aspect each of the one or more notched grooves includes a first stop surface a second stop surface and a slide surface. The arrangement also include a water vessel having a transom surface with the water vessel movably resting on the inclined surface. The arrangement further includes one or more safety catches attached to the transom with each of the one or more safety catches aligned with one of the one or more notched grooves in the inclined surface. In this aspect each safety catch includes a mounting bracket attached to the transom surface and a first support member attached to the mounting bracket. Each safety catch also includes a second support member attached to the mounting bracket with the first and second support members forming a groove therebetween. Each safety catch also includes a catch arm pivotally attached to each of the first support member and the second support member the catch arm positioned within the groove and pivotable between a wedged position extending fully into the notched groove and a released position above the notched groove.

The safety catch further includes a catch arm . As shown the catch arm is positioned within the groove formed between the support members and . The catch arm is suspended between the first and second support members with a pivot link bar extending through upright plates of each of the first support member and the second support member and through the catch arm . This arrangement allows the catch arm to pivot within the groove between a released position shown in and a wedged position shown in . show a spring biasing member at a first protruding end of the pivot bar . A substantially identical spring may be positioned at the other end of the pivot bar at the second support member . According to this embodiment the springs provide a default bias so that the catch arm is biased towards the wedged position shown in . The safety catch may also include one or more additional tensioning members spring to provide additional biasing of the catch arm towards the wedged position. Each spring may be attached at one end to the catch arm and at the other end to a support member or .

In arrangement as shown in the inclined surface has a cradled design to properly support the water vessel . Thus when designed for receiving for water vessels having for example a substantially V shaped hull underside the inclined surface may be a ramp having a corresponding substantially V shaped cradle design as shown in . The surface may be a smooth slick surface made of for example ultra high molecular weight polyethylene. According to the arrangement shown in the water vessel includes two safety catches attached to the transom of the vessel . As shown the safety catches are located at extreme ends of the transom with a first safety catch located towards the portside edge and a second safety catch towards the starboard edge. This design with safety catches positioned at extreme ends of the transom accommodates for water vessels having single or double engine propulsion devices.

It should be noted that although shows the water vessels having two safety catches the arrangement may have one safety catch or more than two safety catches. Similarly although show water vessels having a single safety catch the water vessels may have more than one safety catch. Whatever the number and arrangement of safety catches the inclined surface is provided with the corresponding matching number of notched grooves .

In operation when the water vessel moves in direction X the actuator maintains the catch arm in the released position so that the catch arm moves without making contact with the inclined surface . However if the catch arm is in the wedged position as shown in when the water vessel is moving in direction X the slide surface of the catch arm slides along the slide surface of the notched groove. When the water vessel slips in direction X the actuator withdraws and because of the biasing as outlined above the catch arm has a spring tensioner to keep catch arm pushed down and thus allows stop surfaces and to engage each other. Because of the slant angle the engagement between first stop surfaces and is secure and the catch arm does not climb out of the notch or suffer disengagement. This prevents the water vessel from sliding downwards and the catch arm moves to the wedged position and enters into the notched groove . The catch arm would also enter the notched groove if the catch arm was in the wedged orientation prior to slipping in direction X. When in the groove the forces of gravity and the weight of the water vessel pushes the first stop surface of the catch arm against the first stop surface of the notched groove . Because of the weight of the water vessel and because of the angled connection between first and second stop surfaces and the second stop surface of the catch arm may also engage the second stop surface of the notched groove locking the catch arm in the position shown. This results in holding the water vessel at the locked location along the inclined surface preventing rollback and the related adverse consequences of rollback.
