The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The present invention provides methods and apparatus of improving both the gain and the bandwidth of a microstrip patch antenna.

A patch antenna also referred to as a rectangular microstrip antenna is a type of radio antenna with a low profile that can be mounted on a flat surface. The patch antenna includes a flat conductor mounted on a dielectric substrate over a larger conductor typically referred to as a ground plane. The two metal sheets of the patch antenna form a resonant piece of microstrip transmission line. The patch is designed to have a length of approximately one half wavelength of the radio waves being transmitted or received. A patch antenna can be constructed using the same technology as that used to make a printed circuit board.

An ordinary patch antenna exhibits resonant behavior characterized by a high Q factor and a relatively narrow impedance bandwidth on the order of 2 6 percent depending on the losses in the antenna. Some patch antennas are formed from two stacked patches and are designed to have a double resonance one corresponding to the L1 frequency 1575 MHz and the other to the L2 frequency 1227 MHz commonly used in global positioning systems. provides an exemplary measured voltage standing wave ratio VSWR plot for such an antenna. A first resonance is indicated at L1 and a second resonance is indicated at L2.

Typical patch antennas are tuned to the L1 and L2 GPS commercial frequencies but they lack performance at the operating frequencies of other desirable services including new and emerging COMMs bands such as Iridium which typically operates between 1616 MHz and 1626.5 MHz.

Thus there is a need for antennas that can receive these new bands. There is a further need for adapting existing patch antennas to accommodate additional services operating at these other frequencies.

Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide a microstrip patch antenna having improved bandwidth and gain.

Another object is to provide method for retrofitting an existing microstrip patch antenna to make an antenna having an improved bandwidth and gain.

Yet another object is to provide a kit that can be used to retrofit an existing microstrip patch antenna.

In view of these objects there is provided a method for improving bandwidth and gain of a microstrip patch antenna. A highly anisotropic superstrate is formed and positioned at a predetermined spacing away from the ground plane side of the microstrip patch antenna. A cover layer can be mounted over the highly anisotropic superstrate. The highly anisotropic superstrate can includes a plurality of conductive strips regularly disposed over a dielectric material. In further embodiments the conductive strips can be provided with a capacitive load region at each end of each conductive strip.

An antenna is further provided including a microstrip patch antenna for mounting on a ground plane and a highly anisotropic superstrate having a predetermined resonance placed at a specific spacing above said microstrip patch antenna in the direction away from the ground plane. A cover layer can be positioned over the highly anisotropic superstrate in the direction away from the ground plan. A spacing layer can be disposed on said microstrip patch antenna in order to maintain the specific spacing between the microstrip patch antenna and the highly anisotropic superstrate. The highly anisotropic superstrate can include a plurality of conductive strips regularly disposed on a dielectric substrate. Each of the conductive strips can be provided with a capacitive load region at each end of each conductive strip. The microstrip patch antenna can be a stacked patch antenna having at least two patches where the highly anisotropic superstrate is positioned at a specific spacing above one of the patches. A kit is further provided for retrofitting an existing patch antenna.

Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to the present invention provides methods and apparatus for improving both the gain and the bandwidth of a microstrip patch antenna .

A microstrip patch antenna includes one or more rectangular conductive surfaces printed on a grounded dielectric substrate and fed by a coaxial probe not shown that penetrates the dielectric substrate from beneath. Patch antenna in use is mounted on a conducting ground plane . For purposes of this description the distance away from the ground plane is referenced as being above the ground plane . The patch antenna shown is a stacked patch antenna having two conductive surfaces and and two substrates and . This is used so that the antenna can have two resonances such as at the L1 GPS frequency and at the L2 GPS frequency as is commonly known in the art.

Above this patch antenna at a spacing h is placed a superstrate of a highly anisotropic superstrate. The spacing h can be provided by for example a layer of foam . Spacing layer can be made from any material that is effectively transparent to electromagnetic radiation at the operating range of the modified antenna. A cover layer can be placed over the superstrate for physical protection. The cover layer can be made from syntactic foam. As used herein a highly anisotropic superstrate is characterized by a relative permittivity tensor 

Without the highly anisotropic superstrate an ordinary patch antenna such as 12 exhibits a resonant behavior characterized by a high Q factor and a relatively narrow impedance bandwidth on the order of 2 6 percent. As described above shows a VSWR plot for a typical stacked patch antenna having two resonances.

The addition of the highly anisotropic superstrate allows for the bandwidth of the antenna to be improved. In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention the superstrate was implemented as an array of copper stripes 0.25 inch wide and 2.75 inches long placed on a 0.25 inch thick piece of syntactic foam as shown in . The length to width ratio of the stripes gives them a static polarizability of approximately 10 times that of free space satisfying the definition of a highly anisotropic superstrate. The stripes were placed 1 inch apart. Experimentation with different heights above the patch antenna showed that the significant improvement in bandwidth occurred for a height h of 0.625 inch. This spacing was obtained by placing a block of milled polystyrene foam between the patch and the syntactic foam layers.

The example VSWR plot for the antenna of is shown in . L1 indicates the resonance at the L1 GPS frequency and L2 indicates the resonance at the L2 frequency. A broadened passband is present between about 1425 MHz and 1870 MHz resulting in approximately a 240 MHz span . This broadened passband allows reception or transmission of frequencies other than those provided by the two microstrip patch antennas and .

The metallic stripes forming the anisotropic superstrate were designed to be sub resonant at the frequencies of interest for the above example. They do not achieve resonance until just above 2100 MHz and therefore act as polarizing shapes and not as parasitic radiators as would be the case in a Yagi Uda configuration or a log periodic array.

In the exemplary embodiment shown in the highly anisotropic layer can be implemented as an array of sub resonant metallic shapes resembling the letter I . The capital and the base of the I identified as serve as capacitive loads at the ends of the lengths of the I . These regions allow the induced current at the end of the shape to be non zero which helps the shapes perform as an anisotropic dielectric over a wider range of frequencies. Regions are thus termed capacitive load regions. 

The sub resonant shapes should be oriented with respect to the microstrip patch antenna relative to the current flowing on the patch antenna to maximize the desired performance. This orientation should be such that induced current in the shapes is maximized.

While not limited to any particular theory or mode of operation in some embodiments the resulting antenna operates by controlling the flow of current on the patch. The presence of the highly anisotropic superstrate and the alignment of the dominant axis of the permittivity tensor with the fields associated with the resonant mode of the patch cause a near field interaction effect. This interaction effect alters the current distribution on the antenna limiting the presence of standing waves on the antenna and improving the bandwidth.

The antenna of the present invention allows for a single simple antenna to cover a much wider bandwidth than it would ordinarily be able to while also providing a modest improvement in gain. This allows the new structure to support more communications channels at greater ranges than is possible with current technology. The highly anisotropic superstrate can be easily retro fitted to existing microstrip patch antennas to accommodate additional communications channels.

Other embodiments of the highly anisotropic superstrate are shown in B C and D. shows an embodiment having only strips A. shows a highly packed configuration having offset strips B. shows a configuration having enlarged capacitive load regions at the end of strips C. shows another embodiment for strips D. The benefits of each of these configurations can be determined by computer modeling. Thus it can be seen that the highly anisotropic superstrate can have a variety of configurations within the scope of the current disclosure.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.

It is not intended to be exhaustive nor to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. Such modifications and variations that may be apparent to a person skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined by the accompanying claims.
