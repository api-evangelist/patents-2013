Embodiments of the implementation generally relate to computer graphics and more particularly relate to sampling and filtering of texture data.

Graphics rendering particularly for three dimensional 3D graphics applications is one of the most processing intensive activities performed by personal computers. Graphics co processors are available on most modern day personal computers. is a system employing a graphics processor and a central processor each coupled to a system memory e.g. DRAM eDRAM etc. by a bus. Central processor and graphics processor may be disposed on a single piece of silicon i.e. a single chip solution or integrated at a package board or system level. Graphics processor includes a plurality of parallel processing sub systems or slices . Each slice may be replicated any number of times for greater parallel graphics processing power. Within slice there are a number of execution units EU also known as shader cores or simply cores. Each EU contains scalar integer and floating point arithmetic units that execute instructions. Each EU has an instruction set architecture ISA may support context switching and pre emptive multi tasking and may be essentially a complete x86 core for example. Along with EUs slice includes a level two L2 cache e.g. SRAM eDRAM etc. and texture sampler . Texture sampler includes fixed function logic e.g. state machines . Texture sampler may communicate with EU via cache . Cache may function as a texture cache that is a read only memory to texture sampler holding large arrays of predetermined texture data for use in texture mapping when a graphic is rendered for display by a platform hosting system .

The transformation of scene information source data into displayable images requires a number of functionalities referred to in aggregate as a 3D graphics rendering pipeline. is flow diagram depicting certain operations particular to a texture mapping portion of the graphics rendering pipeline. Texture mapping generally entails imaging a textured signal onto a primitive s geometry for example giving the appearance of pixel level detail on more coarsely rendered polygon meshes that are manipulated on a vertex basis. At operation texture coordinates are assigned to vertices of a given polygon. Generally a texture is a digital image comprising an array of texels texture elements which may be individually addressed based on location within a two dimensional u v coordinate space or in a three dimensional u v s coordinate space. In the u v coordinate space u is the width and v is the height and may be mapped between 0 and 1 based on the texture width and height. At operation the texture coordinates are interpolated at each pixel within the polygon. At operation a texture color at each pixel is fetched into cache based on the interpolated texture coordinate. At operation the texture is sampled and filtered to arrive at a particular texel color at each pixel. Often there is a disparity between a number of sample texture elements texels and the source texture image and the number of picture elements pixels to which the image is mapped. If a texture is too large or too small for a given polygon the texture is filtered to fit the space. A magnification filter enlarges zooms in a texture a minification filter reduces zooms out the texture to fit into a smaller area. Texture magnification maps few texels to many pixels by repeating the sampled texel for a plurality of addresses for example providing a blurrier image. Texture minification maps many texels to few pixels by combining more than one texel value into a single value. This can cause aliasing or jagged edges and antialiasing techniques become important to reduce visual artifacts. The goal of texture filtering then is to compute the average value of the image over an area around each pixel for example through averaging of many texels associated with a given pixel.

Texture filtering has largely been performed by fixed function logic found in texture sampler . Such texture samplers have a fixed filter footprint shape associated with a type of texture filtering such as point sampling bi linear filtering tri linear filtering and anisotropic filtering. As the filtering methods become increasingly complex and as uses for texture data continues to expand for example being used for lighting and other surface properties in addition to color a sampler with a fixed function filter has become inefficient and or insufficient. As such shader programs instantiated by EU have taken larger roles in texture mapping for example resulting in the architecture of system illustrated in . In system EU implements a filter footprint in an application layer and a plurality of texture requests in u v space associated with footprint are sent to the texture sampler . Texture sampler then fetches texture data into the cache for each of the u v addresses associated with filter footprint . EU executing instructions defined in the application layer then accumulates texture data . As such texture data for an entire footprint is passed through the texture sampler with no data reduction because filtering is off loaded from fixed function logic onto EU . In this configuration however sampler chip area occupied by fixed function logic is wasted. Another issue with this architecture is reduced cache usage efficiency. With multiple sampler messages sent from a kernel there s a higher probability that the interleaved messages from multiple EUs will cause many cache evictions. Furthermore texture mapping bandwidth is potentially constrained with the greater amount of data communicated between EU and texture sampler since texture data is not significantly processed and or reduced by texture sampler . Another disadvantage of the system architecture depicted in is that filtering performed by EU may require more power and may be slower than if implemented with optimized purpose built logic within texture sampler . Therefore the programmability afforded with shader based filtering may be particularly disadvantageous for mobile devices executing graphics intensive applications where the greater power demand translates into reduced battery life.

Systems apparatus articles and methods are described below including a multi mode texture sampler capable of flexible filtering operations providing a high performance and low power solution for 2D and 3D visual computing applications. is a graph comparing certain sampler architectures that may be employed by a graphics processor with respect to their relative power requirements and programmability. Near the origin is a fixed function sampler filter offering for example a bi linear texture filter. Highly optimized filter function logic may implement such a filter very economically for lowest power and high efficiency. However the lack of programmability of this filter is unable to accommodate any application specific filter. On the other extreme is the shader implementing an fully programmable ISA filter which may accommodate any application specific filtering operation but consumes the most power. One step down in power and programmability from the shader filter is a sampler with an ISA filter within sampler. For such an architecture the sampler has some of the functionality currently found in a shader core EU e.g. a programmable register based scalar instruction set integer logic flow control and memory access in addition to the conversion and special functions typical of texture operations. The ISA filter in sampler can be expected to require power similar to the shader core filter implementation and the greater sampler complexity requires significant increases in chip area. For further comparison the power and programmability attributes of the exemplary multi mode MM sampler with a flexible filter in accordance with embodiments herein is also depicted in . The MM sampler embodiments described herein provide a significant increase in filter programmability indeed arguably enabling the sampler to perform most any texture filtering currently implemented on an ISA filter. However with only a slight increase in power if any relative to a fixed function sampler.

Relative to shader based filters the multi mode texture sampler embodiments described herein may further provide more balanced heterogeneous computing for example as depicted in the graphics processor architecture of . In exemplary architecture EU is to perform vector math higher level rendering algorithms and memory writes etc. When texture mapping is needed a texture address u v is communicated to a multi mode MM texture sampler . For a given texture address MM texture sampler is to fetch texture data for a variety of footprints and reduce texture data by processing with MM filter accumulator . MM filter accumulator is suitable for providing output values corresponding to a weighted average over the variety of filter footprints . MM texture sampler returns to the EU reduced data corresponding a sampled filtered pixel color R G B at each pixel. Unlike a fixed function texture sampler MM texture sampler is configurable to accommodate both a wide variety of footprints and allow for a footprint to be significantly wider than the bi linear 2 2 texel footprint often employed in fixed function minification filtering. The MM texture sampler can require less power and reduced EU to sampler communication while still providing a greater level functionality such as lighting shadowing effects heretofore available only through shader based filters. In exemplary embodiments in addition to supporting flexible footprints MM texture sampler further supports legacy fix function modes such as point and or linear sampling and bilinear and or trilinear filter modes.

Filter coefficients are an additional input to MM texture sampler . Filter coefficients may be stored in memory entered for example as one or more coefficient tables through API . API may be implemented for example as a set of extensions to an existing graphics processor API such as but not limited to DirectX and OpenGL. API exposes coefficient tables to an application layer and may allow the tables to be populated with predetermined values appropriate for a given filter. As one example an application layer routine that evaluates a Gaussian blur function may be executed to automatically generate coefficients values stored in coefficient tables . Fixed memory allocations for storing values in coefficient table s may be made based on the size of the predetermined bounding region within which a footprint is defined as well as the mode of the MM texture sampler.

In embodiments MM texture sampler is selectively operable in both a separable filter mode and a non separable filter mode for any of a plurality of programmable filter footprints. In the exemplary embodiment the non separable filter mode implements the filter function 

In embodiments API further exposes a filter type ID that is indicative of the mode in which MM texture sampler is to operate while remaining in a given state. For example filter type ID may store a flag bit etc. specifying the non separable or separable filter mode. In further embodiments API may additionally expose a filter shape ID . MM sampler and more specifically DG may utilize the filter shape ID to efficiently generate contributing sub sample addresses i.e. those addresses within the predetermined bounding region having non zero filter coefficients . In one embodiment of the separable filter mode filter shape ID stores the filter height h and width w of the separable filter. In one embodiment of the non separable filter mode filter shape ID stores a bit mask that specifies filter coefficients within the bounding region that are non zero. Such a bit mask may be generated by a graphics processor driver for example based on entries in the coefficient table s .

As further illustrated in MM texture sampler includes MM filter logic FL unit which performs filtering and returns a color value e.g. R B G R B G A etc. at each pixel based on the filter mode filter footprint texel values and filter coefficient values. This returned value may then be utilized in output pipeline and output to display or utilized in a hidden layer calculation etc. . MM FL includes flexible filter block FFB having logic circuitry to perform filtering over any flexible footprint provided in either separable or non separable filter modes. MM FL further includes accumulator that is to accumulate a plurality of flexible filter block outputs to generate a weighted average over a given flexible filter footprint. MM FL may further include a divider not depicted to normalize output from FFB or accumulator before returning the filter value to EU . As such MM FL is configurable to perform weighted accumulation on colors of all texels within the footprint for example as defined by filter type ID and or filter shape ID . In further embodiments as described elsewhere herein MM FL is sufficiently generalized to also perform conventional bi linear filtering at a rate unimpeded by the more flexible architecture of MM FL unit .

A more detailed description of the texture data processing techniques and microarchitecture of components introduced in exemplary system are now discussed in turn.

Further explanation of an exemplary multi mode flexible texture filter method is described in the context of . In accordance with the exemplary embodiment method is performed by the system depicted in . In accordance with other embodiments a texture sampler having an arbitrary alternative hardware architecture performs method . For example a texture sampler having only one of a separable and non separable filter mode may nonetheless implement certain aspects of the method . In accordance with still other embodiments a graphics processor having alternate arrangements of logic circuitry and application software may perform method . For example a texture sampler may implement only some of the functions described in the context of in hardware while other functions are implemented in software. As such while in one embodiment the method is performed by system system is not required to perform method and system need not perform every operation of method .

Method begins at operation with a texture sampler accessing a filter type identifier to determine whether to enter a non separable filter state or a separable filter state. At operation for either a non separable or a separable filter the texture sampler may further access a filter shape identifier to determine the filter footprint parameters. A footprint includes all texels that contribute to a filtered texture value. illustrates a variety of exemplary footprints that may be programmed within the exemplary 8 8 bounding regions in accordance with embodiments. A large dot in represents an output texel sample associated with a non zero filter coefficient that therefore contributes to the particular filtered value while a small dot is a non contributing texel associated a zero valued coefficient. Notably because embodiments herein enable designation of a vast number of arbitrary footprints the eight examples depicted in do not represent an exclusive listing but instead are merely to show the great variety of permissible filter shapes and sizes. Filter footprint for example has the same size as a conventional bi linear interpolation filter footprint while footprint is useful for a Gaussian filter. Footprints and are all exemplary anisotropic filter shapes. Footprint is useful for a bi cubic filter and footprint illustrates a maximum 8 8 texel filter.

In the exemplary embodiment any of a plurality of filter footprints may be defined within a predetermined bounding region. A particular footprint may be associated with a given sampler state permitting a filter footprint changes with each sampler state change if desired. The number of different filter footprints possible for a given texture sampler is therefore scalable with the number of filter states that are permissible. depicts a plurality of footprints that may each be associated with a given state of a multi mode flexible texture sampler in accordance with embodiments. For each of footprints there are a fixed number of texels within an 8 8 bounding region e.g. N . This dimensionality may vary however as an implementation detail. In one illustrative embodiment a first filter footprint suitable for an anisotropic filter is applied in one filter state while another footprint suitable for a Gaussian filter is applied in another filter state.

Returning to upon receiving a texture request at operation for example in the form of a texture address from a shader core the texture sampler generates a sequence of texel sub sample addresses u v at operation based on the filter footprint. The filter footprint is applied to the input texture address u v by referencing the sampling positions associated with the footprint to the input texture address. In the exemplary embodiment the bounding region e.g. in is centered at the input texture address u v with output sampling positions then referenced to addresses u v . In embodiments sub sample addresses u v are generated for each of a predetermined number of samples associated with a group of neighboring texels that contain at least one contributing texel. This group of neighboring texels represents a minimum granularity for generation of output samples from any given input address and any given footprint. In one embodiment this minimum granularity is a texel quad or 2 2 of neighboring texels. depicts the exemplary texel quad inclusive of texels T T T and Trepresented by a 2 2 of sampling addresses. Embodiments herein leverage the texel quad as an atomic addressing unit advantageous in many respects because of the significant amounts of sampler logic circuitry designed to efficiently utilize pixel locality. For example values associated with a 2 2 address sequence can be efficiently fetched into a single cache line from memory. Hence even where a footprint includes only one texel such as depicted in a sequence of four sub sample addresses u v are generated. For example in texel quad that contains one contributing texel specified by footprint one sub sample address for each of texel T T T and Tis generated for a given input texture address u v .

Dashed boxes in further illustrate exemplary texel quads for each illustrated footprint. For example footprint results in generation of four texel quads and . For each quad through four sub sample addresses are generated for a total of 16 sub samples for a given input texture address u v . Similarly footprint results in generation of 12 u v sub sample addresses corresponding to three texel quads. Generation of sub sample address may proceed over a single or multiple clock cycles. In further embodiments logic circuitry within the texture sampler e.g. within the data generator internally sequences the sub sample addresses following one or more algorithm to minimize the number of texel quads generated for a given footprint and or to maximize coherency of sampling positions etc. In further advantageous embodiments the bounding regions e.g. N in are dimensioned to contain an even multiple of the multi texel sampling group of minimum granularity. For example as shown in for an 8 8 texel bounding region footprint fills the bounding region and a sequence of 16 texel quads are generated corresponding to 64 output sub sample addresses u v for an input texture address u v at each pixel.

Notably any of the footprints depicted in may be implemented in either separable or non separable modes of the texture sampler. In the separable filter mode the footprint is defined as the product of two footprints in 1D space. The filter shape identifier may then be indicative of a 1D width vector associated with a first 1D footprint and a 1D height vector associated with a second 1D footprint for example. The texture sampler then generates four sub sample addresses for each texel quad containing at least one texel specified by a first 1D footprint having a first programmable number of texels e.g. programmable width w and a second 1D footprint having a second programmable number of texels e.g. programmable height h . With the predetermined bounding region referenced to the input texture address u v sub sampling positions specified in the separable filter footprint may be addressed as u v .

In the non separable filter mode where there is one coefficient Cfor each texel within the bounding region four sub sample addresses are generated for each texel quad that contains at least one texel having a non zero coefficient value. In this mode the filter coefficient table may serve to specify the footprint with the non zero coefficient values being the only sampling positions contributing to the filter. For such embodiments all coefficients may be read to generate a sequence of sub sample addresses. In further embodiments a sampling mask may be generated from the coefficient table. As one example 16 bits may specify an 8 8 bounding region with each bit of the mask indicating one or a few coherent sampling positions e.g. one 2 2 quad within the bounding region of the corresponding filter. Notably with all the sub sample addresses u v now generated for all multi texel groupings containing at least one contributing texel processing of each sub sample address can efficiently proceed through the filter logic circuitry for each input texture address communicated between shader core and texture sampler.

Returning to method continues with fetching filter coefficients into the cache. In embodiments coefficient values are fetched for each texel sub sample address in a manner dependent on the filter mode. While at least one filter coefficient is needed for each sub sample address u v only one filter coefficient Cis utilized in the non separable filter mode while two filter coefficients H Vare employed in the separable filter mode. Coefficient precision may vary with implementation. For example 8 bit or 16 bit coefficients may be supported in either separable or non separable modes. In one exemplary embodiment multiple levels of precision e.g. selectable between 8 bit and 16 bit are supported for a coefficient e.g. C . In certain separable mode embodiments values from two coefficient tables one for Hand one for V are cached for each sub sample address. Also in certain non separable filter mode embodiments coefficients are accessed based only on the non fractional portion of the input texture address with any fractional portions of an input texture address ignored e.g. rounded . Hence non separable filters may provide texel level precision. For certain separable filter mode embodiments however the cached coefficients values are based on or a function of or dependent on the fractional portion of the input texture address. Such embodiments offer sub texel precision. Further description of such fractional addressing for filter coefficients and other aspects of the separable filter mode are provided further below in the context of following discussion of method .

Continuing in reference to a texel color value corresponding to each sub sample address u v is fetched from memory into the texel data cache at operation . Any techniques known in the art may be utilized at operation as embodiments are not limited in this respect. At operation sub sampled texture data is filtered based on the texel color value and coefficient value associated with each texel sub sample address. For example the filter function equation provided above may be implemented with filter logic circuitry that multiplies the filter coefficient e.g. C at each sub sample address u v with the color value of the corresponding texel T at each sub sample address u v . The resulting color value for each sub sample address is then passed to an accumulator which may also be implemented in the filtering logic circuitry of the sampler. In the accumulator values are accumulated in each color channel e.g. R B G over all of the sub sample addresses u v . The accumulated color is then returned at operation e.g. to EU as the sampled and filtered color for a pixel which may also be packed along with filtered colors corresponding to other pixels. While method is generally applicable to both non separable and separable filter modes various operations in method e.g. and are dependent on the filter mode. Additional aspects particular to the separable filter mode are now described in greater detail in the context of .

Continuing with description of method using the above technique to properly offset horizontal and vertical coefficients the coefficients are fetched from memory into the coefficient cache following the sequencing of the texel groupings of the minimum granularity that were generated at operation . In the exemplary embodiment where this minimum grouping is the texel quad containing 2 2 neighboring texels four coefficients for each texel quad e.g. the two horizontal coefficients and the two vertical coefficients and in are advantageously fetched from memory into one cache line. A number of such coefficient cache lines may be sequenced over the number of texel quads generated for the specified separable filter footprint e.g. two cache lines for two texel quads sixteen cache lines for sixteen quads etc. . The separable filter equation above may then be implemented with the cached vertical and horizontal coefficient for each sub sample address multiplied together to form a compound 2D coefficient at operation . This is further illustrated for the exemplary 2 2 texel quad in where horizontal coefficients H H are multiplied by vertical coefficients Vand Vto arrive at compound coefficients HVand HV. Horizontal coefficients Hand Hare each similarly multiplied by vertical coefficients Vand Vto arrive at compound coefficients HVand HV. At this point method can return to operation in method where the cached lines of filter coefficients are the compound coefficients output from method . Operations and of method then proceed as further exemplified in where the compound filter coefficients are then multiplied with the texel color values T T T and Tfor the corresponding quad of sub sample addresses which may be similarly stored in a single cache line . The resulting weighted texel color values are then accumulated over all sub sample addresses sequenced for the separable footprint to arrive at the filtered color value output from the texture sampler at operation .

Further description of a multi mode filter logic unit configurable for a weighted averaging of texel colors in addition to bilinear filtering is now provided in the context of . Such multi mode filter logic unit has flexibility to support the multiple sampler modes described above for weighted averaging over any particular filter footprint and also perform efficient bilinear interpolation as needed. For the sake of clarity configurable filter architectures and multi mode filtering methods are described in the context of MM FL unit depicted in . Although one or more of these features so described may be advantageously incorporated into MM FL unit it is noted that one or more of these features may be incorporated into a graphics processing system in a number of alternative manners. As such one or more features found in filter logic unit embodiments may be implemented without one or more of the features described above in the context of a multi mode sampler. For example one or more multi mode filter logic embodiments do not require a flexible footprint mode just as one or more multi mode sampler supporting a flexible footprint does not require multi mode filter logic. Nevertheless embodiments incorporating a multi mode sampler supporting a flexible footprint mode with a multi mode filter logic unit have a synergy that will be clear to one of ordinary skill.

In embodiments a graphics processing system includes a configurable or flexible texture filter suitable for implementing a multi mode filtering method. is a flow diagram illustrating a multi mode filtering method in accordance with an embodiment. Method begins with receiving a filter mode signal at operation . The filter mode signal at least differentiates between a bilinear filter mode and a flexible filter mode. In the bilinear filter mode texel data e.g. color values is weighted at operation with a bilinear filter using the sub texel fractional address to arrive at a filtered color output at operation . In the flexible filter mode texel data is weighted at operation based on predetermined texel weighting coefficient values that may or may not be dependent on the sub texel fractional address. For example in a non separable filter mode as described above the coefficients received at operation in the flexible filter mode are independent of the fractional address while the coefficients have a sub texel dependence in the separable filter mode.

In response to determining the mode signal is indicative of the bilinear filter mode at operation method proceeds to operation where filter logic performs the bilinear interpolation i.e. bilerp over four texel values received at operation . For the exemplary embodiment where a single 2 2 texel quad was sub sampled based on the texture address e.g. equivalent to quad for footprint in a single cache line read includes these four neighboring texel values. The bilerp is performed using coefficients that are indicative of the fractional texture address and which are received at operation .

In response to determining the mode signal is indicative of the flexible filter mode at operation method proceeds to operation where the filter logic generates a weighted average over at least four texel values received at operation . For the exemplary embodiment where a number of 2 2 texel quads were sub sampled as u v based on the texture address and footprint e.g. any of the footprints through depicted in a single cache line read may include the four neighboring texel values. The weighted average over one texel quad is generated using four predetermined weighting coefficients each coefficient being indicative of a weighting associated with the corresponding texel in the quad. Upon arriving at the filtered color at operation method is complete and the weighted average color may be then returned to an accumulator e.g. accumulator in for further averaging over a plurality of texel quads mapped to the filter footprint and or returned to a shader core e.g. EU in for subsequent output of a graphical object to a display screen.

The logic circuitry of filter logic unit further includes at least a pair of flexible filter blocks FFB that are coupled to the filter mode signal input and operable in a plurality of modes selectable by the filter mode signal. In one exemplary embodiment each FFB is configurable to perform a portion of the bilerp or similarly perform a portion of the flexible weighted averaging over a texel quad. As described further below with circuitry of an FFB responsible for only a portion of a given one of the multiple filtering functions each FFB may advantageously include the same circuitry and so represent a scalable filter logic block that is fully utilized regardless of the filtering mode. Such a microarchitecture design makes efficient use of chip area and reduces power consumption. In the exemplary microarchitecture the filtering is apportioned between two FFB such that circuitry represented by a pair of FFB is operable in a first mode to perform the bilinear interpolation over the group of four neighboring texel values based on two input coefficients indicative of a fractional address associated with the four texels read in for a given input address. Similarly circuitry represented by a pair of FFB is also operable in a second mode to generate the weighted average over the group of four neighboring texel values based on four coefficients each indicative of a weighting associated with one of four texel values read in for a given filter footprint. Averaging over four texels may be then further accumulated over the footprint for example by accumulator in .

In the exemplary embodiment depicted in filter logic unit includes four FFB and . Responsive to the filter mode signal circuitry represented by FFB and FFB is operable in a first mode to perform the bilinear interpolation over a group of four neighboring texel values received at texel value input line A using coefficients received from coefficient input line A. Circuitry represented by the FFB and is operable in a second mode to generate the weighted average over the group of four neighboring texel values from input line A using coefficients received from input line A. In this exemplary embodiment an FFB pair is staged in the bilinear filter mode with the bilerp serialized into a horizontal phase handled by one FFB and a vertical phase handled by the second FFB. In the flexible filter mode FFB pairs are not so staged but rather each FFB instead generates a weighted average over two of the four texels in parallel. The weighted average is then accumulated to arrive at a weighted average of one four texel quad. With this microarchitecture multiplexer distributes coefficients received on input line A to each of FFB and . In the bilinear filter mode the coefficients are associated with a first dimension of a fractional address e.g. . Multiplexer similarly distributes coefficients associated with the second dimension of the fractional address e.g. from coefficient input line B. Coefficients based on are output to FFB for use in the second phase of the staged bilerp filtering.

In embodiments a selector is coupled between a pair of filter logic blocks to selectively stage two flexible filter blocks. The selector may either pass output from an upstream filter block to a downstream filter block or to an output stage responsible for further processing such as accumulation. In the exemplary embodiment depicted in output from FFB is passed to selector . Selector is further coupled to filter mode signal input and in response to a bilinear filter mode signal passes output from FFB to an input of FFB . Similarly output from FFB is coupled to selector which like selector is further coupled to filter mode signal input . In response to a bilinear filter mode signal selector passes output from FFB to an input of FFB . FFB is coupled to output stage and outputs a result of the second phase of the staged bilerp filtering based the coefficient received from multiplexer for a first texel quad. FFB similarly provides to output stage results of the second phase of the staged bilerp filtering with the coefficient received from multiplexer for a second texel quad.

Alternatively in response to a flexible filter mode signal selectors pass output from FFB respectively to output stage .

Where 8 bit logic is employed in the FFB and each texel value T T T Tand has an 8 bit representation and the interpolated values T and T have 16 bit representations and likewise for T T .

In the bilinear filter mode this coefficient is for example. FFB further includes two texel value inputs A B each to receive a texel color value. A first multiplier has a first input coupled to the coefficient input and a second input coupled to texel value input A. A second multiplier has a first input coupled to the first coefficient input through an invertor and a second input coupled to the second texel value input B. An adder is coupled to an output of first multiplier and an output of second multiplier . The coupling between multiplier and adder is through a switch that is responsive to the filter mode signal. In the bilinear mode switch is closed to pass a texel value e.g. T as scaled by the complement of or which is added to the product of another texel value e.g. T as scaled by or to generate the first interpolated value e.g. T . This logic is replicated within the filter block by inputs A and B multipliers invertor adder and switch to generate the second interpolated value e.g. T thereby implementing one phase of a bilinear interpolation.

Coupled to output the adders and is accumulator which is further coupled to the filter mode signal and is to either add together or pass the outputs of the adders based on the filter mode signal and whether the first or second lerp phase is being performed.

In this state switches and are open and coefficients received at inputs and are each multiplied by texel values received at inputs A and A respectively. These scaled values pass through to accumulator . In the flexible filter mode accumulator is to sum the received values and output a weighted average of two texels as described elsewhere herein.
