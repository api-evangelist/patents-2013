The promotional or voucher information may include a virtual bonus game a virtual promotional game a virtual base game or combinations thereof.

Features and advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example the features of the various embodiments.

Various embodiments are directed to a game gaming machine gaming systems and method for playing a game wherein the gaming system includes augmented reality that interacts with a player card. The embodiments are illustrated and described herein by way of example only and not by way of limitation. Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to there are shown illustrative examples of games gaming machines gaming systems and methods for playing a game in accordance with various aspects of the gaming system which includes augmented reality that interacts with a player card.

Examples in accordance with one or more aspects of the augmented reality player card system are shown in . One embodiment of an augmented reality player card system includes an augmented reality application that interacts with a player card . Such an embodiment may be employed in casinos where carded play is allowed and a player is given a player card . This type of player card typically contains information e.g. an identification code that is used for retrieving player information from the backend system. In the embodiments of the augmented reality player card system described below this Augmented Reality technology may be used to leverage this player card information in order to provide enhanced presentation of this information in an augmented reality construct along with additional features that leverage a virtual format.

These features of the augmented reality player card system that are presented in a virtual format include by way of example only and not by way of limitation 1 displaying player card information on an Augmented Reality display of a mobile device s camera 2 displaying promotions available in the casino on an Augmented Reality display of a mobile device s camera and 3 displaying bonus games which can be played using Augmented Reality technology on an Augmented Reality display of a mobile device s camera. In one embodiment of the augmented reality player card system awards credits points are added to the game when a player next uses the player card . These features may be enabled when the player sees his player card through a camera in an Augmented Reality equipped mobile device such as a smart phone tablet or HUD Heads Up Display of a mobile device.

In one embodiment of an augmented reality player card system applications are incorporated using Augmented Reality technology over a player card . Typically an Augmented Reality enabled mobile device or Augmented Reality system is equipped with Augmented Reality applications that may be used to leverage information on the player card .

In the augmented reality player card system the Augmented Reality applications may be downloaded to the Augmented Reality mobile device using an automatic approach or a manual approach. In the automatic approach a patron s Augmented Reality enabled mobile device is identified by an ID system. The ID system prompts the Augmented Reality system for the patron s permission to download the Augmented Reality application. The actual download from the ID system to the Augmented Reality mobile device may be performed through Wi Fi BlueTooth or other wired wireless communication mechanisms. In the automatic approach the patron may download the Augmented Reality application at a kiosk. The Augmented Reality mobile device may communicate with the kiosk through a wireless protocol WiFi BlueTooth or a wired protocol. Patron can initiate the download of the application from the kiosk.

As shown in the player card contains information such as a patron s account number as well as potential other gaming and or non gaming information. Using the account number the following applications may be made available 1 displaying player specific information 2 showing promotions and or 3 enabling game play. These applications are explained in detail below 

Referring now to one embodiment of the of the Augmented Reality Player Card system shown in when the Augmented Reality device scans the player card the Augmented Reality device recognizes that the object is a player card belonging to the particular casino. The Augmented Reality mobile device then reads the player code from the face of the player card and sends the code to the backend of the Augmented Reality system. In some embodiments of the augmented reality player card system the player code may be in the form of a QR code . Alternatively the player code may be read from the card through Optical Character Recognition.

Once the player code is obtained the Augmented Reality mobile device sends the code to the backend of the Augmented Reality system. In one embodiment of the augmented reality player card system the backend of the Augmented Reality system authenticates the player through a PIN Personal Identification Number entry. The PIN entry may be implemented using a virtual Augmented Reality image. Once the PIN is authenticated the backend of the Augmented Reality system sends the player card details to the Augmented Reality mobile device . In this embodiment the Augmented Reality mobile device then superimposes the player information above the player card as viewed through the display of the mobile device or other suitable viewing device . In such an embodiment the player can virtually view all the details stored on the player card with unique 3D graphical representations as shown in simply by directing the display of the mobile device towards the player card.

Referring now to in some embodiments of the Augmented Reality Player Card system the player may choose to view the promotional offers that have been acquired e.g. the player may have an offer for a complementary drink movie ticket restaurant voucher or promotional points . This promotional information may be displayed after the player has seen the other player specific information e.g. credits available . In one embodiment of the Augmented Reality Player Card system the promotions being offered and or related information may be displayed as a superimposed 3D image over the player card as shown in . In one aspect of this embodiment the player may choose any of these offers by selecting the virtual buttons superimposed over the player card video.

Once the player chooses an option by selecting a virtual button on the display screen of the Augmented Reality mobile device the mobile device communicates with the backend of the Augmented Reality system to take the corresponding action. For example if the player chooses the complementary drink option the Augmented Reality mobile device can present an e voucher with a message stating that the player can pick up the order a specific counter. If the player chooses the movie ticket the Augmented Reality mobile device can talk to the backend of the Augmented Reality system and issue an e ticket voucher as an MMS which the player can take to the movie theater. In this same manner other promotional offers can be exercised by the player using the Augmented Reality mobile device and the selection of a virtual button in the augmented reality environment.

Referring now to in some embodiments of the Augmented Reality Player Card system the Augmented Reality device can be used to play promotional games e.g. as part of promotions . When the player chooses to play promotional games options for games can be presented in the augmented reality environment. The player can choose to play a particular game by selecting a virtual button in the augmented reality environment.

Since this type of game is typically a bonus game the Augmented Reality mobile device can talk to an electronic bonus system engine to play the bonus game. In such an embodiment the bonus game is super imposed over the player card . The player can play this superimposed game graphics in the virtual augmented reality environment just as the player would play the bonus game on a traditional gaming machine e.g. the player is able to virtually select bonus game indicators to participate in the game . The electronic bonus system tracks the points bet earned during this play. An example of this activity is displayed in .

In various embodiments of the Augmented Reality Player Card system several features can be provided on an Augmented Reality device using player card . Though the Augmented Reality mobile device using the player card is used in a casino environment in some embodiments the Augmented Reality Player Card system can be implemented outside a casino environment using secure internet communication in other embodiments.

By using the Augmented Reality Player Card system to view a player card the system enables the player to view information associated with his player card and in a virtual format that is visually impactful. The Augmented Reality Player Card system may also be easy used by aged players since the system does not require much physical movement by the player. The Augmented Reality Player Card system is a technologically attractive interface which increases the entertainment value of the surrounding environment.

Referring now to in another aspect of some embodiments gaming systems are utilized that include augmented reality viewing capabilities . In such embodiments of the disclosed gaming system smart phones are utilized that include a built in gyroscope as well as location tracking technology such as a digital compass and a GPS system Global Positioning System . These features enable the accurate position and orientation of the smart phones and its user to be derived. Additionally some other embodiments of the disclosed gaming system use object recognition and OCR Optical Character Recognition techniques combined with location orientation derivation to provide players in casinos easy ways of finding games progressive jackpots particular machines and other players of their choice.

The overall arrangement of the gaming systems that include augmented reality viewing capabilities may be seen in . In broad terms gaming systems that include augmented reality viewing capabilities include an application loaded onto a camera enabled smart phone a back end system for assisting the application and integration modules for connecting to an existing Business Intelligence System BIS .

In some embodiments the Business Intelligence System provides a database or other structure that includes a table of the position and orientation of every gaming machine in a venue. Continuing in such embodiments each position orientation is associated with a unique identifier that enables this system to query the Casino Management System CMS to retrieve data for the gaming machine in question such as current occupancy historical performance current denomination and other relevant attributes.

The basic operation of one embodiment of a gaming system that includes augmented reality viewing capabilities is shown in . A player installs an augmented reality venue application on his phone and activates the application when he enters the venue. Preferably the application may be automatically activated by a Bluetooth or wireless message that is received by the phone when it passes through a portal such as a casino entrance. Alternatively the application may be automatically activated by a locale condition programmed into the smart phone tied to the venue s GPS location. In the simplest implementation the application is manually activated by the player.

Once activated the application of the gaming system having augmented reality viewing capabilities begins to control the built in primary camera of the smart phone. In one such embodiment a message is displayed on the smart phone display asking the user to aim the camera at gaming machines or other objects of interest in the venue.

Once aimed the augmented reality application determines the location of the phone by means such as GPS Bluetooth or cell tower triangulation. In another embodiment the augmented reality application determines the location of the phone by analysis of the image being captured by the camera. In this regard physical reference points may be placed in the casino for the camera to find. Next the orientation of the phone is determined. This may be accomplished by accessing the internal digital gyroscope embedded within the smart phone.

Once the location orientation of the smart phone is known the objects of interest such as gaming machines that may be seen by the smart phone s camera may be computed. This may be achieved by placing the camera position orientation within a virtual 3D representation of the venue. This virtual representation may be built up offline by parsing the Business Intelligence System table of position orientations of gaming machines and other objects. From time to time this representation may be updated to take into account the moving of gaming machines and signage around the venue.

In one embodiment of the gaming system having augmented reality viewing capabilities a list of gaming machines and other objects currently visible to the camera are built up. For each object visible a virtual position on the smart phone display may be derived by performing an inverse projection matrix on the co ordinates of the gaming machine. The camera captured image is rendered on the smart phone display and an icon is overlaid on the image for each visible object. An example of this output is shown in .

As shown in in another aspect of the gaming system having augmented reality viewing capabilities some different types of icons may be shown depending upon the type of object or some meta data associated with an object. In the example shown in a standard gaming machine is shown with a green icon a gaming machine that is being played and thus unavailable is shown with a blue icon and the gaming machine with the highest payout over a recent period of time i.e. the hottest gaming machine is shown with a red icon.

Another type of icon shown in the embodiment of is a user icon. This user icon represents another player such as a player that the current user has an affinity with e.g. a spouse or relative . In some embodiments of the gaming system having augmented reality viewing capabilities the player may register affinities in the CMS or via the augmented reality venue application. By employing such an embodiment the player is able to find their spouse by simply panning their camera around until the user icon is straight ahead.

Notably icons such as the user icon need not represent an object directly visible by the player. In some embodiments of the augmented reality venue system signage and banks of gaming machines may be between the player and their spouse but do not affect the operation of this system.

As shown in once an icon is shown the player may touch the touchscreen on their smart phone at the location of the icon to bring up information about the object in question. shows an example of such information. In this example the user has selected the red icon near a Hot Shots game on the image displayed on his phone. This selection causes a pop up window with information about the game including the detail that this is the Hottest Slot by some measure e.g. perhaps this gaming machine has paid out the most money over the last 24 hours .

In some embodiments the pop up window also lets the player know that this gaming machine is available to play which might not be apparent if there are any obstructions between the gaming machine and the user. In one such embodiment this availability information is obtained by the back end systems by querying the CMS to see if any credits or player tracking card are inserted.

Referring now of in another aspect of a gaming system having augmented reality viewing capabilities the pop up window also enables a player to reserve a gaming machine. Reserving gaming machines is popular in some markets and this novel feature extends the reserving feature. If a player chooses to reserve the gaming machine by selecting the button on their smart phone a message is sent up from the phone to the back end system and onto the CMS to reserve the gaming machine. Preferably the CMS generates a PIN and transmits this PIN to the gaming machine and back to the phone. This PIN is displayed on the phone as shown in . The gaming machine then locks up for a period of time to give the player time to walk over. When the player reaches the gaming machine he or she enters the matching PIN and the game is unlocked. Once the time limit is reached the gaming machine automatically unlocks to prevent the gaming machine from being held out of service.

Referring now to an embodiment of a gaming system having augmented reality viewing capabilities is shown in which a user has selected an augmented reality venue with the signage highlighted. This type of reservation may be restricted to users of a certain standing for example Platinum Level players to ensure they have priority for popular games.

Once the list is formed the list is sorted by distance from the user based upon the gaming machine location table in the Business Intelligence System. The nearest gaming machine matching is then presented on the screen if it is visible by a vertical arrow icon pointing at the gaming machine. In some embodiments the arrow icon is flashing. In another aspect of one embodiment if the nearest matching gaming machine is off of the screen a horizontal arrow is displayed that indicates which way the player should rotate themselves to bring the matching gaming machine into view. As the player rotates himself holding the phone in front of him the arrow position is updated and eventually replaced by a vertical arrow pointing directly at the gaming machine.

In one embodiment of a gaming system having augmented reality viewing capabilities Platinum players or other selected players are presented with another option when all gaming machines of a particular type are in use or the player has a particular favorite machine. These players may be given the option to pre reserve a gaming machine or game such that they will be informed by the augmented reality application the moment that their game or favorite machine becomes free. At this point the gaming machine in question will be reserved for a period of time using the PIN method described above.

Referring now to an embodiment of a gaming system having augmented reality viewing capabilities shows yet another feature. As mentioned above players may register affinities to other players. In this example as well as being able to find their friends or spouse the player may choose to find the same game at a different gaming machine they are playing or possibly sending an instant message IM to their friend to be displayed on the friend s gaming machine. In the case of community games the Find Available option may also allow a player to find a free seat in the same community game as their friend.

Some preferred implementations of the disclosed embodiments use 1 a smart phone for the client that has a GPS or other positioning system as well as a gyroscope for accurate orientation detection 2 any suitable web server for communication with the smart phone and registration of players and 3 OpenCV image analysis software. Additionally some embodiments provide features that include by way of example only 1 enabling players to quickly find objects of interest 2 increasing casino revenue by helping players find their favorite games quicker 3 enabling players to reserve games from their phone 4 leveraging technology that players already have and 5 utilizing a system that is inexpensive to deploy since it does not require any new infrastructure. In other aspects some embodiments provide 1 the use of the phone as a way of finding objects in a casino 2 the ability to reserve games from the phone and unlock the games with a PIN 3 notification when games become available and 4 the ability to find other players and the games that they are playing.

In another aspect of some embodiments gaming systems are utilized that include augmented reality gaming capabilities . In such embodiments of the disclosed gaming system smart phones are utilized that include built in object recognition technologies and OCR Optical Character Recognition techniques combined with location orientation derivation to provide players in casinos with additional gaming options and opportunities. In one embodiment of a gaming system that includes augmented reality gaming capabilities such object recognition technologies and OCR capabilities are similar to those provided by Google s Goggles application.

The overall arrangement of the modules that make up an embodiment of a gaming system that includes augmented reality gaming capabilities may be seen in . In some embodiments the gaming system having augmented reality gaming capabilities consists of an augmented reality gaming application loaded onto a camera enabled mobile smart phone a back end system for assisting the application and in some scenarios additional software modules as part of the gaming machine software.

In one implementation of a gaming system that includes augmented reality gaming capabilities the gaming process proceeds in the following manner. A player approaches a game machine to play a game e.g. Joker Poker . Joker Poker is a video poker game in which a player makes a decision about which cards to hold or draw. During the game the player may reach a point where the player is unsure of the correct strategy with which to proceed. When this point of uncertainty occurs the player may take out his mobile phone and select the augmented reality gaming assistance application. Next the player is prompted to point his smart phone s camera to the gaming machine screen. Once the camera is aimed at the screen the player presses the camera shutter button and an image is captured as seen in .

The augmented reality gaming assistance application transmits the image to the backend server via a 3G third generation or GPRS General Packet Radio Service encrypted SSL secure socket layer session to a public web service and awaits a response. The backend server using object recognition and OCR technology determines the following from analyzing the image 1 the paytable of the game and thus the game title 2 the current game state and 3 the player s credit bet information. From the first two of these items all possible strategies are determined by the system. This information along with the game name and state is transmitted back to the augmented reality gaming assistance application on the mobile phone over the 3G connection.

In one embodiment the augmented reality gaming assistance application may present the information to the player in a number of ways as shown in . In the example of the theoretical best choice for the player is presented for the game of Joker Poker along with information concerning the possible outcomes to the game. Notably the player is free to experiment on the assistance application of the player s smart phone selecting and de selecting potential cards to hold. During this process the odds are presented below the cards as the cards are being updated to reflect the current scenario e.g. after each selection de selection .

While the augmented reality gaming assistance application is clearly useful for beginner players the application is also useful for more expert players by taking into account progressive jackpots which may cause strategy to vary depending upon the current progressive amount. Furthermore the augmented reality gaming assistance application provides additional benefits whenever variables are added to games such as a wild card or when more complex odds are associated with the outcome of a game.

In some embodiments of the gaming system having augmented reality gaming capabilities once the game title is determined other information can also be made available by the phone application. For example links to tutorials discussion forums and social networking sites specific to the game may be offered. Such tutorials may take into account the current state of the game and offer context sensitive help.

In other more sophisticated embodiments of the gaming system that include augmented reality gaming capabilities the gaming process proceeds in the following manner. While the video poker example presented above provides the content on the player s smart phone related to the game these above described embodiments do not augment the output of the gaming machine directly. However in more sophisticated embodiments of the gaming system that includes augmented reality gaming capabilities an augmented display captures the output from the gaming machine via the camera in the phone and overlays virtual graphics on the smart phone s display that either 1 appear to be on the gaming machine display when viewed via the mobile phone or 2 augment the gaming machine display with elements that indicate points of interest on the gaming machine.

Referring now to one embodiment of a gaming system having augmented reality gaming capabilities that illustrates how an augmented feature may be deployed is shown. Firstly a player associates the gaming machine being played with the phone he is holding. This association may be accomplished in a number of ways two of which are described below. In the first association technique the gaming machine begins displaying calibration marks at the corner of the LCD display or in other unobtrusive positions once the augmented session has begun. An example of these calibration marks is shown in . Continuing as the player holds the camera of the smart phone up in front of the gaming machine the application controlled camera captures the image of the gaming machine including the game LCD output. Since it is unlikely that the player will be holding the camera directly parallel to the LCD the image of the LCD will likely be slightly trapezoidal as shown in .

Referring now to the object recognition system takes this image and extracts the calibration marks. In some embodiments the object recognition system uses a standard object recognition algorithm. Notably this amount of computation is well within the real time capability of today s modern smart phone. If more advanced computational processing is required for some reason the object recognition algorithm may be run by transmitting the image to the backend server where the image may be processed. This is not the preferred solution due to the time taken to transmit the image would likely interfere with real time overlay by producing significant lag. In a more preferred embodiment once the calibration marks are decoded the mobile phone application overlays images at suitable points on the camera derived image. The techniques for achieving this image overlay are described above with respect to the gaming system having an augmented reality venue .

Referring now to an example of potential context sensitive help being overlaid at the correct position on the camera image is shown. In such an embodiment of the gaming system having augmented reality gaming capabilities a player is assigned a lucky symbol for a feature. In some embodiments the determination of this symbol is based upon past performance by the player of this game past performance of the machine a hashing algorithm based upon the player s name or telephone number or combinations thereof. Continuing when the player reaches the selection stage of the feature the player uses the augmented reality application on his smart phone to take a photo or video and receive the image overlay as shown in .

Referring now to an embodiment of a gaming system having augmented reality gaming capabilities is shown that includes data marks in the captured image. These data marks may be displayed at similar locations to calibration marks or ideally as in they may be embedded within a suitable graphic. In the embodiment shown in the data marks are the Dragon s eyes. In one aspect of a disclosed embodiment a data mark performs by temporally varying the intensity of the pixel s that compose it. From the player s perspective this varying of intensity appears as though the dragon s eyes are flickering. In contrast an actual flicker typically requires an encoded stream of data. A simple implementation uses a high intensity pixel to indicate a binary 1 and a low intensity pixel to indicate a binary 0. In some embodiments multiple data marks are used to increase data throughput.

By using calibration marks the overall geometry of the game LCD is known with respect to the camera image. From this geometry the expected position of the data marks may be derived. In some embodiments the data marks are utilized as a one way method of the game communicating with the augmented reality gaming application. In this manner the data marks may be used for the following purposes 1 The state of the game may be efficiently communicated e.g. during free spins the data marks may cause the phone to augment the display with extra graphical FX . 2 The game may provide secret hints to the player via their mobile phone with regard to choices to make during a game. Such features may be constructed such that the hints do not affect the overall hold over time or simply decrease the hold by a known amount. In one embodiment players may be targeted who have a consistent record of betting larger. 3 Game play statistics may be encrypted and sent via the data mark and augmented reality gaming application to a secure web service. These statistics may be collected by the manufacturer as an alternative means of collecting marketing data. Notably in most embodiments the phone application does not affect the outcome or operation of the underlying game since the communication is only one way.

In another embodiment of the gaming system having augmented reality gaming capabilities particular data marks provide a means for a gaming machine manufacturer to potentially track the deployment of games. Historically there have been problems in some markets of games and machines being resold without the manufacturer s consent. This may potentially result in copy protection methods being breached. Through the implementation of the disclosed gaming system a manufacturer may make use of the location awareness of a modern smart phone which then transmits the location of the phone along with data from the data mark which is capable of uniquely identifying the gaming machine. If the location of the gaming machine is found to be incorrect based upon sales records corrective action may be taken.

As noted above there are a number of methods for establishing an augmented reality gaming session using an embodiment of the disclosed gaming system. As shown in Bluetooth wireless technology may be used by installing a Bluetooth radio in the gaming machine and leveraging the existing Bluetooth capabilities of a standard smart phone. In this manner the selected gaming machine continually broadcasts to suitable Bluetooth devices using known Bluetooth discovery processes. When a handshake is made the gaming machine determines if the handshake is from the augmented reality gaming application or from another source. If the handshake is from another source the gaming machine sends a Bluetooth text message giving instructions on how to download the augmented reality gaming application.

Referring now to once the gaming system is in communication with the augmented reality gaming application the game information and state is sent to the application. This enables the augmented reality gaming application to display a menu such as shown in . In some embodiments updated state information may be continually sent by Bluetooth rather than by the use of data marks or OCR throughout the session. This configuration provides the advantage of using Bluetooth. However this benefit must be balanced against the potential downside of the communication being theoretically two way and thus harder to be approved by certain gaming regulators.

As described in an alternative to Bluetooth may be implemented using object recognition from a camera image. Specifically in such an embodiment the augmented reality gaming application which is loaded onto the player s smart phone asks the user to take a photo of the gaming machine. Through the use of known object recognition algorithms the name of the game may be extracted. Further information may also be obtained by OCR analysis of the camera image. Specifically the arrangement of symbols and the values of meters and other states are extracted from the camera image. Moreover for marketing purposes this data may be sent by the backend server or by the augmented reality gaming application via an SSL secure socket layer session to a secure manufacturer s web service.

Continuing in this embodiment once the state of the game is known an augmented state may be presented to the player via the display screen of the smart phone. For example in some embodiments where a player is given the choice of three boxes to open an arrow may appear on the mobile phone display pointing to the box that the player should favor. An example of an image capture from the process of is shown in . In this embodiment a player is playing a game called Burger Run. Referring now to a successful determination of the state results is shown in the content of the smart phone s display screen.

In this embodiment the smart phone s display screen presents a number of features to the player including by way of example only Game Rules Games Like This Progressive Info Secret Strategy and Download App. The Game Rules feature includes a standard pay table videos demonstrating the features present in the game and other general information. Selecting the Games Like This feature presents a list of games that were similar to a previously played game based upon denomination volatility and or other factors. The Progressive Info feature is described in further detail below. In some embodiments the Secret Strategy feature refers a player to one or more social networking sites where players may debate and propose strategies for the current game. The Secret Strategy feature may also provide context sensitive help that is overlaid at the correct position on the camera image as described above in to give the player the feeling that he may have an edge on the game. The Secret Strategy feature may also present time limited bonuses that are currently available at this gaming machine e.g. Power Winners promotions that are currently near the location of the smart phone .

In another aspect of some embodiments the Download App feature enables a player to download a fun version i.e. non gambling version of the game onto their phone. Otherwise stated in such an embodiment the gaming system having augmented reality gaming capabilities enables players to simply take a photo of games they wish to have on their smart phone and have them automatically downloaded for continued future use.

Referring again to the Progressive Info feature this feature is further illustrated in . Specifically illustrates a logic flow diagram of a process to present progressive rating. In one embodiment illustrates a smart phone in the process of acquiring progressive information for progressive value decoding. As with video poker the gaming system having augmented reality gaming capabilities enables a player to take a photo of a progressive game. Continuing as shown in the mobile phone application or the backend server analyzes the current state of the meters to determine the current favorability of playing the game. This analysis is done by using the known meter positions within the captured LCD image which may be derived by looking up the meter positions for a particular game once the game title itself has been derived using the processes in or .

In some embodiments the images at the meter positions are passed to an OCR Optical Character Recognition algorithm to determine the current progressive values. These values are then checked for sanity i.e. if the values read are out of range for what may be expected there may likely by either a problem with the image capture or with the installed progressive game . The values are then compared against their associated range and a rating is determined. Otherwise stated a progressive may have a range with a maximum expected value of 100 and a minimum of 90. If the current value read is 99.50 one would expect this progressive to be likely triggered comparatively soon. This result would also cause a high rating to be given.

In another embodiment of the gaming system having augmented reality gaming capabilities if the progressive is open ended and does not have a maximum value then the rating may be determined based upon the theoretical hold of the game based upon its current progressive states. In this manner higher progressive values lead to a higher theoretical hold. In the case of multiple progressives each rating may be shown individually or combined into either an average or maximum rating. A maximum rating shows the rating of only the likeliest progressive to hit. Once determined the rating is shown to the player an example of which is shown in . In such an embodiment progressive games are given a rating equivalent to the widely known Homeland Security warning system. Like its security counterpart the rating may be configured such that the low rating is never chosen.

Notably the use of calibration marks or a Bluetooth for determining the gaming machine screen position and orientation in a captured image is not necessary. In some embodiments of the gaming system having augmented reality gaming capabilities the game title may be determined by OCR or object recognition. In this manner the fixed geometry and small set of possible images in a game may be used to quickly and accurately determine which game is present. Once the game title is determined the known structure of the game display may be used in place of calibration marks. For example in one embodiment the game shown in has touch screen buttons in the lower corners marked Cash Out and Spin which may be detected by object recognition and used as fixed points in the same way that the calibration marks would be used. Finally in still another embodiment techniques disclosed with respect to augmented reality gaming may be used as a way of augmenting a conventional stepper based game in the way that LCD overlays have been used. In this manner a complex winning line arrangement may be shown on the mobile phone screen.

The proximity and biometric devices and circuitry may be installed by upgrading a commercially available PIB such as a Bally iVIEW unit. Coding executed on EGM Processor Board PID and or GMU may be upgraded to integrate a game having an interactive wheel game as is more fully described herein.

Peripherals connect through bus to EGM Processor Board . For example a bill ticket acceptor is typically connected to a game input output board which is in turn connected to a conventional central processing unit CPU board such as an Intel Pentium microprocessor mounted on a gaming motherboard. I O board may be connected to CPU processor board by a serial connection such as RS 232 or USB or may be attached to the processor by a bus such as but not limited to an ISA bus. The gaming motherboard may be mounted with other conventional components such as are found on conventional personal computer motherboards and loaded with a game program which may include a gaming machine operating system OS such as a Bally Alpha OS. Processor board executes a game program that causes processor board to play a game. In one embodiment the game program provides a slot machine game having an interactive wheel feature game. The various components and included devices may be installed with conventionally and or commercially available components devices and circuitry into a conventionally and or commercially available gaming machine cabinet examples of which are described above.

When a player has inserted a form of currency such as for example and without limitation paper currency coins or tokens cashless tickets or vouchers electronic funds transfers or the like into the currency acceptor a signal is sent by way of I O board to processor board which in turn assigns an appropriate number of credits for play in accordance with the game program. The player may further control the operation of the gaming machine by way of other peripherals for example to select the amount to wager via electromechanical or touch screen buttons. The game starts in response to the player operating a start mechanism such as a handle or touch screen icon.

The game program includes a random number generator to provide a display of randomly selected indicia on one or more displays. In some embodiments the random number generator may be physically separate from gaming machine . For example it may be part of a central determination host system which provides random game outcomes to the game program. Thereafter the player may or may not interact with the game through electromechanical or touch screen buttons to change the displayed indicia. Finally processor board under control of the game program and OS compares the final display of indicia to a pay table. The set of possible game outcomes may include a subset of outcomes related to the triggering of a feature game. In the event the displayed outcome is a member of this subset processor board under control of the game program and by way of I O Board may cause feature game play to be presented on a feature display.

Predetermined payout amounts for certain outcomes including feature game outcomes are stored as part of the game program. Such payout amounts are in response to instructions from processor board provided to the player in the form of coins credits or currency via I O board and a pay mechanism which may be one or more of a credit meter a coin hopper a voucher printer an electronic funds transfer protocol or any other payout means known or developed in the art.

In various embodiments the game program is stored in a memory device not shown connected to or mounted on the gaming motherboard. By way of example but not by limitation such memory devices include external memory devices hard drives CD ROMs DVDs and flash memory cards. In an alternative embodiment the game programs are stored in a remote storage device. In one embodiment the remote storage device is housed in a remote server. The gaming machine may access the remote storage device via a network connection including but not limited to a local area network connection a TCP IP connection a wireless connection or any other means for operatively networking components together. Optionally other data including graphics sound files and other media data for use with the EGM are stored in the same or a separate memory device not shown . Some or all of the game program and its associated data may be loaded from one memory device into another for example from flash memory to random access memory RAM .

In one or more embodiments peripherals may be connected to the system over Ethernet connections directly to the appropriate server or tied to the system controller inside the EGM using USB serial or Ethernet connections. Each of the respective devices may have upgrades to their firmware utilizing these connections.

GMU includes an integrated circuit board a GMU processor and memory including coding for network communications such as the G2S game to system protocol from the Gaming Standards Association Las Vegas Nev. used for system communications over the network. As shown GMU may connect to card reader through bus and may thereby obtain player card information and transmit the information over the network through bus . Gaming activity information may be transferred by the EGM Processor Board to GMU where the information may be translated into a network protocol such as S2S for transmission to a server such as a player tracking server where information about a player s playing activity may be stored in a designated server database.

PID includes an integrated circuit board PID processor and memory which includes an operating system such as Windows CE a player interface program which may be executable by the PID processor together with various input output I O drivers for respective devices which connect to PID such as player interface devices and which may further include various games or game components playable on PID or playable on a connected network server and PID which is operable as the player interface. PID connects to card reader through bus display through video decoder and bus such as an LVDS or VGA bus.

As part of its programming the PID processor executes coding to drive display and provides messages and information to a player. Touch screen circuitry interactively connects display and video decoder to PID such that a player may input information and cause the information to be transmitted to PID either on the player s initiative or responsive to a query by PID . Additionally soft keys connects through bus to PID and operates together with display to provide information or queries to a player and receive responses or queries from the player. PID in turn communicates over the CMS SMS network through Ethernet switch and busses and with respective servers such as a player tracking server.

Player interface devices are linked into the virtual private network of the system components in gaming machine . The system components include the iVIEW processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board. These system components may connect over a network to the slot management system such as a commercially available Bally SDS SMS and or casino management system such as a commercially available Bally CMP CMS .

The GMU system component has a connection to the base game through a serial SAS connection and is connected to various servers using for example HTTPs over Ethernet. Through this connection firmware media operating system software or gaming machine configurations can be downloaded to the system components from the servers. This data is authenticated prior to installation on the system components.

The system components include the iVIEW processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board. The GMU and iVIEW can be combined into one like the commercially available Bally GTM iVIEW device. This device may have a video mixing technology to mix the EGM processor s video signals with the iVIEW display onto the top box monitor or any monitor on the gaming device.

In accordance with one or more embodiments is a functional block diagram of a gaming kernel of a game program under control of processor board using gaming kernel by calling it into application programming interface API which is part of game manager . The components of game kernel as shown in are only illustrative and should not be considered limiting. For example the number of managers may be changed additional managers may be added or some managers may be removed without deviating from the scope and spirit of the disclosed system.

As shown in the example there are three layers a hardware layer an operating system layer such as but not limited to Linux and a game kernel layer having game manager therein. In one or more embodiments the use of a standard operating system such a UNIX based or Windows based operating system allows game developers interfacing to the gaming kernel to use any of a number of standard development tools and environments available for the operating systems. This is in contrast to the use of proprietary low level interfaces which may require significant time and engineering investments for each game upgrade hardware upgrade or feature upgrade. The game kernel layer executes at the user level of the operating system and itself contains a major component called the I O Board Server . To properly set the bounds of game application software making integrity checking easier all game applications interact with gaming kernel using a single API in game manager . This enables game applications to make use of a well defined consistent interface as well as making access points to gaming kernel controlled where overall access is controlled using separate processes.

For example game manager parses an incoming command stream and when a command dealing with I O comes in arrow the command is sent to an applicable library routine . Library routine decides what it needs from a device and sends commands to I O Board Server see arrow . A few specific drivers remain in operating system s kernel shown as those below line . These are built in primitive or privileged drivers that are i general ii kept to a minimum and iii easier to leave than extract. In such cases the low level communications is handled within operating system and the contents is passed to library routines .

Thus in a few cases library routines may interact with drivers inside operating system which is why arrow is shown as having three directions between library utilities and I O Board Server or between library utilities and certain drivers in operating system . No matter which path is taken the logic needed to work with each device is coded into modules in the user layer of the diagram. Operating system is kept as simple stripped down and common across as many hardware platforms as possible. The library utilities and user level drivers change as dictated by the game cabinet or game machine in which it will run. Thus each game cabinet or game machine may have an industry standard processor board connected to a unique relatively dumb and as inexpensive as possible I O adapter board plus a gaming kernel which will have the game machine unique library routines and I O Board Server components needed to enable game applications to interact with the gaming machine cabinet. Note that these differences are invisible to the game application software with the exception of certain functional differences i.e. if a gaming cabinet has stereo sound the game application will be able to make use of API to use the capability over that of a cabinet having traditional monaural sound .

Game manager provides an interface into game kernel providing consistent predictable and backwards compatible calling methods syntax and capabilities by way of game application API . This enables the game developer to be free of dealing directly with the hardware including the freedom to not have to deal with low level drivers as well as the freedom to not have to program lower level managers although lower level managers may be accessible through game manager s interface if a programmer has the need. In addition to the freedom derived from not having to deal with the hardware level drivers and the freedom of having consistent callable object oriented interfaces to software managers of those components drivers game manager provides access to a set of upper level managers also having the advantages of consistent callable object oriented interfaces and further providing the types and kinds of base functionality required in casino type games. Game manager providing all the advantages of its consistent and richly functional interface as supported by the rest of game kernel thus provides a game developer with a multitude of advantages.

Game manager may have several objects within itself including an initialization object not shown . The initialization object performs the initialization of the entire game machine including other objects after game manager has started its internal objects and servers in appropriate order. In order to carry out this function the kernel s configuration manager is among the first objects to be started. The configuration manager has the data needed to initialize and correctly configure other objects or servers.

The upper level managers of game kernel may include game event log manager which provides at the least a logging or logger base class enabling other logging objects to be derived from this base object. The logger object is a generic logger. Otherwise stated the logger object is not aware of the contents of logged messages and events. The log manager s job is to log events in non volatile event log space. The size of the space may be fixed although the size of the logged event is typically not. When the event space or log space fills up one embodiment deletes the oldest logged event each logged event has a time date stamp as well as other needed information such as length providing space to record the new event. In this embodiment the most recent events are found in the log space regardless of their relative importance. Further provided is the capability to read the stored logs for event review.

In accordance with one embodiment meter manager manages the various meters embodied in the game kernel . This includes the accounting information for the game machine and game play. There are hard meters counters and soft meters. The soft meters may be stored in non volatile storage such as non volatile battery backed RAM to prevent loss. Further a backup copy of the soft meters may be stored in a separate non volatile storage such as EEPROM. In one embodiment meter manager receives its initialization data for the meters during startup from configuration manager . While running the cash in and cash out managers call the meter manager s update functions to update the meters. Meter manager will on occasion create backup copies of the soft meters by storing the soft meters readings in EEPROM. This is accomplished by calling and using EEPROM manager .

In accordance with still other embodiments progressive manager manages progressive games playable from the game machine. Event manager is generic like log manager and is used to manage various gaming machine events. Focus manager correlates which process has control of various focus items. Tilt manager is an object that receives a list of errors if any from configuration manager at initialization and during game play from processes managers drivers and the like that may generate errors. A random number generator manager is provided to allow easy programming access to a random number generator RNG as an RNG is required in virtually all casino style gambling games. The RNG manager includes the capability of using multiple seeds.

In accordance with one or more embodiments a credit manager object not shown manages the current state of credits cash value or cash equivalent in the game machine including any available winnings and further provides denomination conversion services. Cash out manager has the responsibility of configuring and managing monetary output devices. During initialization cash out manager using data from configuration manager sets the cash out devices correctly and selects any selectable cash out denominations. During play a game application may post a cash out event through the event manager the same way all events are handled and using a callback posted by cash out manager and cash out manager is informed of the event. Cash out manager updates the credit object updates its state in non volatile memory and sends an appropriate control message to the device manager that corresponds to the dispensing device. As the device dispenses dispensable media there typically are event messages being sent back and forth between the device and cash out manager until the dispensing finishes. After the dispensing finishes the cash out manager having updated the credit manager and any other game state such as some associated with meter manager that needs to be updated for this set of actions sends a cash out completion event to event manager and to the game application thereby. The cash in manager functions similarly to cash out manager addressing requirements for controlling interfacing and managing actions associated with cashing in events cash in devices and associated meters and crediting.

In a further example in accordance with one or more embodiments I O server may write data to the gaming machine EEPROM memory which is located in the gaming machine cabinet and holds meter storage that must be kept even in the event of power failure. Game manager calls the I O library functions to write data to the EEPROM. The I O server receives the request and starts a low priority EEPROM thread within I O server to write the data. This thread uses a sequence of an 8 bit command and data writes to the EEPROM device to write the appropriate data in the proper location within the device. Any errors detected are sent as IPC messages to game manager . Preferably all of this processing is asynchronously performed.

In accordance with one embodiment button module within I O server polls or is sent the state of buttons every two milliseconds. These inputs are debounced by keeping a history of input samples. Certain sequences of samples are required to detect a button was pressed in which case the I O server sends an inter process communication event to game manager that a button was pressed or released. In some embodiments the gaming machine may have intelligently distributed I O which debounces the buttons in which case button module may be able to communicate with the remote intelligent button processor to retrieve the button events and simply relay them to game manager via IPC messages. In still another embodiment the I O library may be used for pay out requests from the game application. For example hopper module must start the hopper motor constantly monitoring the coin sensing lines of the hopper debounce them and send an IPC message to the game manager when each coin is paid.

For example each computer system or computing device in the systems described herein or any embodiment of a system disclosed herein may utilize one or more of the following components a single core or multi core hardware processor e.g. central processing unit or graphics processing unit on which software instructions are executed e.g. instructions corresponding to an operating system an application program an interpreter such as a virtual machine or a compiler a memory associated with and in connection with the hardware processor such as cache or other system memory that stores software instructions or other data that the hardware processor may access for processing an input device e.g. mouse keyboard touchscreen and the like an output device e.g. display touchscreen printer and the like a network or communication interface that enables the computer system to communicate over a network or communication protocol an application program having corresponding software instructions that are executable by a hardware processor. Connections between different computer systems and connections between different computer system components may be wired or wireless.

Virtualization computing techniques cloud computing techniques web application website computing techniques traditional and adaptive streaming techniques and other computing techniques may be implemented by any embodiment of a system disclosed herein to enable and or enhance the teachings described herein. For example in a cloud computing embodiment one or more servers i.e. one or more computer systems may store and execute software instructions corresponding to an application program based on input data received from client devices. In response to the input data received the application program is executed accordingly which results in graphical data being processed and output to the client devices for display on a display such as a touch screen on a smart phone or tablet computer.

As another example in a web application or website embodiment data representative of a user input may be transmitted to a server i.e. a computer system hosting the website for processing and storage in memory.

One or more embodiments of the systems disclosed herein may utilize streaming technology. Streaming data enables data to be presented to the user of the client device while the client device receives data from the server. Streaming data from servers to client devices e.g. computing devices operated by users over a network is typically limited by the bandwidth of the network or alternatively the physical layer net bitrate. Traditional streaming protocols such as RTSP Real Time Streaming Protocol MS WMSP Windows Media HTTP Streaming Protocol and RTMP Real Time Messaging Protocol may be implemented which essentially send data in small packets from the server to the client device in real time at the encoded bitrate of the data. Adaptive streaming may also be implemented. Adaptive streaming almost exclusively relies on HTTP for the transport protocol. Similar to traditional streaming data is encoded into discrete packets of a particular size however the source data is encoded at multiple bitrates rather than a single bitrate. The data packets corresponding to the same data encoded at different bitrates are then indexed based on the bitrate in memory. This streaming method works by measuring in real time the available bandwidth and computer capacity of the client device and adjusts which indexed data packet to transfer based on the encoded bitrate.
