Inhibitors of histone deacetylases HDAC have been shown to modulate transcription and to induce cell growth arrest differentiation and apoptosis. HDAC inhibitors also enhance the cytotoxic effects of therapeutic agents used in cancer treatment including radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs. Marks P. Rifkind R. A. Richon V. M. Breslow R.

Adv Cancer Res 91 137 168 2004 .

A recent review has summarized the evidence that aberrant histone acetyltransferase HAT and histone deacetylases HDAC activity may represent a common underlying mechanism contributing to neurodegeneration. Moreover using a mouse model of depression Nestler has recently highlighted the therapeutic potential of histone deacetylation inhibitors HDAC5 in depression. Tsankova N. M. Berton O. Renthal W.

There are 18 known human histone deacetylases grouped into four classes based on the structure of their accessory domains. Class I includes HDAC1 HDAC2 HDAC3 and HDAC8 and have homology to yeast RPD3. HDAC4 HDAC5 HDAC7 and HDAC9 belong to class IIa and have homology to yeast. HDAC6 and HDAC10 contain two catalytic sites and are classified as class IIb. Class III the sirtuins includes SIRT1 SIRT2 SIRT3 SIRT4 SIRT5 SIRT6 and SIRT7. HDAC11 is another recently identified member of the HDAC family and has conserved residues in its catalytic center that are shared by both class I and class II deacetylases and is sometimes placed in class IV.

There is still much to be understood about the family of HDACs including the varying functions of different HDACs and the range of HDAC substrates. In order to learn more about the role that the individual HDACs play it is important to develop compounds showing selectivity for individual isoforms or small subsets of these isoforms. While some degree of isoform selectivity has been shown by a few compounds this problem of identifying selective inhibitors is far from solved and the problem is complicated by the interactions of the HDACs with each other as well as other proteins cofactors that can possibly alter their interaction with various inhibitors Glaser et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 325 683 690 2004 . Clinically the optimal dose timing and duration of therapy as well as the most appropriate agents to combine with HDAC inhibitors are also still to be defined.

The findings to date suggest that HDAC inhibitors have great therapeutic potential in promoting cognitive function enhancing learning and memory and treating disease. There is a need to identify specific selective HDAC inhibitors and to identify the structural features required for potent HDAC inhibitory activity.

By pharmaceutical formulation it is further meant that the carrier solvent excipient s and salt must be compatible with the active ingredient of the formulation e.g. a compound of the invention . It is understood by those of ordinary skill in this art that the terms pharmaceutical formulation and pharmaceutical composition are generally interchangeable and they are so used for the purposes of this application.

The term acid addition salt refers to a salt of a compound of the invention prepared by reaction of a compound of the invention with a mineral or organic acid. For exemplification of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts see e.g. Berge S. M Bighley L. D. and Monkhouse D. C. 66 1 1977. Compounds of this invention which are amines are basic in nature and accordingly react with any of a number of inorganic and organic acids to form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts.

Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the invention can be formed by reacting a compound of the invention with an equimolar or excess amount of acid. Alternatively hemi salts can be formed by reacting a compound of the invention with the desired acid in a 2 1 ratio compound to acid. The reactants are generally combined in a mutual solvent such as diethylether tetrahydrofuran methanol ethanol isopropanol benzene or the like. The salts normally precipitate out of solution within about one hour to about ten days and can be isolated by filtration or other conventional methods.

Inorganic acids commonly employed to form such salts include hydrochloric acid hydrobromic acid hydroiodic acid sulfuric acid phosphoric acid and the like. Organic acids commonly employed to form such salts include p toluenesulfonic acid methanesulfonic acid oxalic acid p bromophenylsulfonic acid carbonic acid succinic acid citric acid benzoic acid acetic acid and the like. Examples of such pharmaceutically acceptable salts thus are the sulfate pyrosulfate bisulfate sulfite bisulfite phosphate monohydrogenphosphate dihydrogenphosphate metaphosphate pyrophosphate chloride bromide iodide acetate propionate decanoate caprylate acrylate formate isobutyrate caproate heptanoate propiolate oxalate malonate succinate hemisuccinate suberate sebacate fumarate maleate butyne 1 4 dioate hexyne 1 6 dioate benzoate chlorobenzoate methylbenzoate dinitrobenzoate hydroxybenzoate methoxybenzoate phthalate sulfonate xylenesulfonate phenylacetate phenylpropionate phenylbutyrate citrate lactate hydroxybutyrate glycollate tartrate methanesulfonate propanesulfonate naphthalene 1 sulfonate naphthalene 2 sulfonate mandelate and the like.

Some of the compounds of the present invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms such as for example hydrates.

Since prodrugs are known to enhance numerous desirable qualities of pharmaceuticals e.g. solubility bioavailability manufacturing etc. the compounds of the present invention can be delivered in prodrug form. Thus the present invention is intended to cover prodrugs of the compounds of the invention methods of delivering the same and compositions containing the same. Prodrugs are intended to include any covalently bonded carriers that release an active parent drug of the present invention in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Prodrugs are prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved either in routine manipulation or in vivo to the parent compound. Prodrugs include compounds of the invention wherein a hydroxyl or amino group is bonded to any group that when the prodrug of the present invention is administered to a mammalian subject it cleaves to form a free hydroxyl or free amino group respectively. Examples of prodrugs include but are not limited to acetate formate and benzoate derivatives of alcohol and amine functional groups in the compounds of the present invention.

 Solvate means a solvent addition form that contains either a stoichiometric or non stoichiometric amounts of solvent. Some compounds have a tendency to trap a fixed molar ratio of solvent molecules in the crystalline solid state thus forming a solvate. If the solvent is water the solvate formed is a hydrate when the solvent is alcohol the solvate formed is an alcoholate. Hydrates are formed by the combination of one or more molecules of water with one of the substances in which the water retains its molecular state as HO such combination being able to form one or more hydrate.

The term suitable solvent refers to any solvent or mixture of solvents inert to the ongoing reaction that sufficiently solubilizes the reactants to afford a medium within which to effect the desired reaction.

The compounds described herein can have asymmetric centers. Compounds of the present invention containing an asymmetrically substituted atom can be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. It is well known in the art how to prepare optically active forms such as by resolution of racemic forms or by synthesis from optically active starting materials. Many geometric isomers of olefins C N double bonds and the like can also be present in the compounds described herein and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present invention. Cis and trans geometric isomers of the compounds of the present invention are described and can be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separate isomeric forms. All chiral diastereomeric racemic and geometric isomeric forms of a structure are intended unless specific stereochemistry or isomeric form is specifically indicated. All processes used to prepare compounds of the present invention and intermediates made therein are considered to be part of the present invention. All tautomers of shown or described compounds are also considered to be part of the present invention. Furthermore the invention also includes metabolites of the compounds described herein.

The invention also comprehends isotopically labeled compounds which are identical to those recited in the formulae of the invention but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number most commonly found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen carbon nitrogen fluorine such as 3H C C H and F.

Compounds of the present invention and salts hydrates solvates or prodrugs of said compounds that contain the aforementioned isotopes and or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of the present invention. Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as H C are incorporated are useful in drug and or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated i.e. 3H and carbon 14 i.e. C isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. C and F isotopes are particularly useful in PET positron emission tomography . PET is useful in brain imaging. Further substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium i.e. H can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability for example increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances isotopically labeled compounds of this invention can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and or in the Examples below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non isotopically labeled reagent. In one embodiment the compounds of the invention salts hydrates solvates or prodrugs thereof are not isotopically labelled.

When any variable e.g. R occurs more than one time in any constituent or formula for a compound its definition at each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Thus for example if a group is shown to be substituted with one or more Rmoieties then Rat each occurrence is selected independently from the definition of R. Also combinations of substituents and or variables are permissible but only if such combinations result in stable compounds within a designated atom s normal valency.

As used herein the term treat treating alleviate or alleviating herein is meant decreasing the symptoms markers and or any negative effects of a condition in any appreciable degree in a patient who currently has the condition. In some embodiments treatment may be administered to a subject who exhibits only early signs of the condition for the purpose of decreasing the risk of developing the disease disorder and or condition.

As used herein the term prevent prevention or preventing refers to any method to partially or completely prevent or delay the onset of one or more symptoms or features of a disease disorder and or condition. Prevention may be administered to a subject who does not exhibit signs of a disease disorder and or condition.

As used herein subject means a human or animal in the case of an animal more typically a mammal . In one aspect the subject is a human. Such subject can be considered to be in need of treatment with an HDAC inhibitor.

Compounds of the invention are inhibitors of class I histone deacetylases HDAC and are useful for promoting cognitive function and enhancing learning and memory formation. As a result these compounds are useful in treating alleviating and or preventing various conditions including e.g. neurological disorders memory and cognitive function disorders impairments extinction learning disorders fungal diseases inflammatory diseases hematological diseases and neoplastic diseases in humans and animals.

The compounds of the present invention are useful in a variety of applications for human and animal health. The compounds of the invention are histone deacetylase HDAC inhibitors. A histone deacetylase inhibitor as used herein is a compound that inhibits reduces or otherwise modulates the activity of histone deacetylase. HDACs catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues on proteins including histones. HDAC inhibitors also show diverse biological functions including effecting gene expression cell differentiation cell cycle progression growth arrest and or apoptosis. J. Med. Chem. 2003 46 5097 and Curr. Med. Chem. 2003 10 2343 . In various embodiments the compounds of the invention reduce HDAC activity by at least about 50 at least about 75 or at least about 90 or more. In further embodiments HDAC activity is reduced by at least about 95 or at least about 99 or more.

One aspect of the invention provides a method of inhibiting histone deacetylase in a cell comprising contacting a cell in which inhibition of histone deacetylase is desired with an inhibition effective amount of a compound of the invention or a composition thereof. Because compounds of the invention inhibit histone deacetylase s they are useful research tools for in vitro study of the role of histone deacetylase in biological processes. Accordingly in one aspect of the invention the step of contacting the cell is performed in vitro.

The term an inhibiting effective amount is meant to denote a dosage sufficient to cause inhibition of activity of one or more histone deacetylase in a cell which cell can be in a multicellular organism. The multicellular organism can be a plant a fungus or an animal preferably a mammal more preferably a human. The fungus may be infecting a plant or a mammal preferably a human and could therefore be located in and or on the plant or mammal. If the histone deacetylase is in a multicellular organism the method according to this aspect of the invention comprises administering to the organism a compound or composition of the invention. Measurement of the effect of a compound of the invention on the enzymatic activity of a histone deacetylase is achieved using known methodologies. For example Bradner J. et al. Nature Chemical Biology Vol. 6 March 2010 238 243.

The potential of HDAC inhibitors is tremendous but the development of clinical compounds will likely require the design of isoform selective compounds to minimize side effect issues e.g. fatigue anorexia hematological and GI toxicity. Isoform specific HDAC inhibitors provide advantages by reducing toxicities associated with inhibition of other HDACs. Specific HDAC inhibitors provide a higher therapeutic index resulting in better tolerance by patients during chronic or long term treatment. While several HDAC inhibitors are now in the clinic most of these do not show significant selectivity for individual HDAC isoforms.

HDACs are classified into four classes depending on sequence identity domain organization and function. Compounds of the invention are predominately inhibitors of class I histone deacetylases. Class I enzymes HDACs 1 2 3 and 8 range in size from 42 55 kDa and are homologs of yeast Rpd3. They are ubiquitously expressed predominantly nuclear and mainly function as transcriptional corepressors.

In some other embodiments the compound reduces the activity of fewer than all histone deacetylases in the cell. In certain embodiments the compound reduces the activity of one histone deacetylase e.g. HDAC1 or a sub group of histone deacetylases e.g. HDAC1 HDAC2 and HDAC3 to a greater extent than other histone deacetylases. Where the compound preferentially reduces the activity of a sub group of histone deacetylases the reduction in activity of each member of the sub group may be the same or different.

In one aspect the invention provides methods and compositions for treating alleviating and or preventing neurological disorders.

Recent reports have detailed the importance of histone acetylation in central nervous system CNS functions such as neuronal differentiation memory formation drug addiction and depression Citrome Psychopharmacol. Bull. 2003 37 Suppl. 2 74 88 Johannessen CNS Drug Rev. 2003 9 199 216 Tsankova et al. 2006 Nat. Neurosci. 9 519 525 .

In one aspect the invention provides methods and compositions for treating alleviating and or preventing neurological disorders. The term neurological disorder as used herein includes neurological diseases neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders. A neurological disorder is a condition having as a component a central or peripheral nervous system malfunction. Neurological disorders may cause a disturbance in the structure or function of the nervous system resulting from developmental abnormalities disease genetic defects injury or toxin. These disorders may affect the central nervous system e.g. the brain brainstem and cerebellum the peripheral nervous system e.g. the cranial nerves spinal nerves and sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems and or the autonomic nervous system e.g. the part of the nervous system that regulates involuntary action and that is divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems .

As used herein the term neurodegenerative disease implies any disorder that might be reversed deterred managed treated improved or eliminated with agents that stimulate the generation of new neurons. Examples of neurodegenerative disorders include i chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis FALS and ALS respectively familial and sporadic Parkinson s disease Huntington s disease familial and sporadic Alzheimer s disease multiple sclerosis muscular dystrophy olivopontocerebellar atrophy multiple system atrophy Wilson s disease progressive supranuclear palsy diffuse Lewy body disease corticodentatonigral degeneration progressive familial myoclonic epilepsy strionigral degeneration torsion dystonia familial tremor Down s Syndrome Gilles de la Tourette syndrome Hallervorden Spatz disease diabetic peripheral neuropathy dementia pugilistica AIDS Dementia age related dementia age associated memory impairment and amyloidosis related neurodegenerative diseases such as those caused by the prion protein PrP which is associated with transmissible spongiform encephalopathy Creutzfeldt Jakob disease Gerstmann Straussler Scheinker syndrome scrapic and kuru and those caused by excess cystatin C accumulation hereditary cystatin C angiopathy and ii acute neurodegenerative disorders such as traumatic brain injury e.g. surgery related brain injury cerebral edema peripheral nerve damage spinal cord injury Leigh s disease Guillain Barre syndrome lysosomal storage disorders such as lipofuscinosis Alper s disease restless leg syndrome vertigo as result of CNS degeneration pathologies arising with chronic alcohol or drug abuse including for example the degeneration of neurons in locus coeruleus and cerebellum drug induced movement disorders pathologies arising with aging including degeneration of cerebellar neurons and cortical neurons leading to cognitive and motor impairments and pathologies arising with chronic amphetamine abuse to including degeneration of basal ganglia neurons leading to motor impairments pathological changes resulting from focal trauma such as stroke focal ischemia vascular insufficiency hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy hyperglycemia hypoglycemia or direct trauma pathologies arising as a negative side effect of therapeutic drugs and treatments e.g. degeneration of cingulate and entorhinal cortex neurons in response to anticonvulsant doses of antagonists of the NMDA class of glutamate receptor and Wernicke Korsakoff s related dementia. Neurodegenerative diseases affecting sensory neurons include Friedreich s ataxia diabetes peripheral neuropathy and retinal neuronal degeneration. Other neurodegenerative diseases include nerve injury or trauma associated with spinal cord injury. Neurodegenerative diseases of limbic and cortical systems include cerebral amyloidosis Pick s atrophy and Retts syndrome. The foregoing examples are not meant to be comprehensive but serve merely as an illustration of the term neurodegenerative disorder. 

In some instances the neurological disorder is a neuropsychiatric disorder which refers to conditions or disorders that relate to the functioning of the brain and the cognitive processes or behavior. Neuropsychiatric disorders may be further classified based on the type of neurological disturbance affecting the mental faculties. The term neuropsychiatric disorder considered here as a subset of neurological disorders refers to a disorder which may be generally characterized by one or more breakdowns in the adaptation process. Such disorders are therefore expressed primarily in abnormalities of thought feeling and or behavior producing either distress or impairment of function i.e. impairment of mental function such with dementia or senility . Currently individuals may be evaluated for various neuropsychiatric disorders using criteria set forth in the most recent version of the American Psychiatric Association s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health DSM IV .

One group of neuropsychiatric disorders includes disorders of thinking and cognition such as schizophrenia and delirium. A second group of neuropsychiatric disorders includes disorders of mood such as affective disorders and anxiety. A third group of neuropsychiatric disorders includes disorders of social behavior such as character defects and personality disorders. A fourth group of neuropsychiatric disorders includes disorders of learning memory and intelligence such as mental retardation and dementia. Accordingly neuropsychiatric disorders encompass schizophrenia delirium attention deficit disorder ADD schizoaffective disorder Alzheimer s disease Rubinstein Taybi syndrome depression mania attention deficit disorders drug addiction dementia agitation apathy anxiety psychoses personality disorders bipolar disorders unipolar affective disorder obsessive compulsive disorders eating disorders post traumatic stress disorders irritability adolescent conduct disorder and disinhibition.

In one embodiment the neurological disorder is Alzheimer s disease Huntington s disease seizure induced memory loss schizophrenia Rubinstein Taybi syndrome Rett Syndrome Fragile X Lewy body dementia vascular dementia ADHD ADD dyslexia bipolar disorder and social cognitive and learning disorders associated with autism traumatic head injury or attention deficit disorder.

In another embodiment the neurological disorder is an anxiety disorder conditioned fear response panic disorder obsessive compulsive disorder post traumatic stress disorder phobia social anxiety disorder or substance dependence recovery.

In some embodiments neurological disorders are treated or prevented by decreasing the amount of DNA damage within the neuronal cell. In some embodiments neurological disorders are treated or prevented by increasing histone deacetylase activity within the neuronal cell. In some embodiments neurological disorders are treated or prevented by decreasing histone acetyl transferase activity within the neuronal cell. In some embodiments neurological disorders are treated or prevented by increasing the activity of class I histone deacetylases.

In one aspect the invention provides methods and compositions for promoting cognitive function and enhancing learning and memory formation in both normal subjects as well as those suffering from memory loss and cognitive function disorders impairments. A normal subject as used herein is a subject that has not been diagnosed with a disorder associated with impaired cognitive function. Cognitive function refers to mental processes of a subject relating to information gathering and or processing the understanding reasoning and or application of information and or ideas the abstraction or specification of ideas and or information acts of creativity problem solving and possibly intuition and mental processes such as learning perception and or awareness of ideas and or information. The mental processes are distinct from those of beliefs desires and the like.

Transcription is thought to be a key step for long term memory processes Alberini 2009 Physiol. Rev. 89 121 145 . Transcription is promoted by specific chromatin modifications such as histone acetylation which modulate histone DNA interactions Kouzarides 2007 Cell 128 693 705 . Modifying enzymes such as histone acetyltransferases HATs and histone deacetylases HDACs regulate the state of acetylation on histone tails. In general histone acetylation promotes gene expression whereas histone deacetylation leads to gene silencing. Numerous studies have shown that a potent HAT cAMP response element binding protein CREB binding protein CBP is necessary for long lasting forms of synaptic plasticity and long term memory for review see Barrett 2008 Learn Mem 15 460 467 .

In contrast HDACs have been shown to be powerful negative regulators of long term memory processes. Nonspecific HDAC inhibitors enhance synaptic plasticity as well as long term memory Levenson et al. 2004 J. Biol. Chem. 279 40545 40559 Lattal et al. 2007 Behav Neurosci 121 1125 1131 Vecsey et al. 2007 J. Neurosci 27 6128 Bredy 2008 Learn Mem 15 460 467 Guan et al. 2009 Nature 459 55 60 Malvaez et al. 2010 Biol. Psychiatry 67 36 43 Roozendaal et al. 2010 J. Neurosci. 30 5037 5046 . For example HDAC inhibition can transform a learning event that does not lead to long term memory into a learning event that does result in significant long term memory Stefanko et al. 2009 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 106 9447 9452 . Furthermore HDAC inhibition can also generate a form of long term memory that persists beyond the point at which normal memory fails. HDAC inhibitors have been shown to ameliorate cognitive deficits in genetic models of Alzheimer s disease Fischer et al. 2007 Nature 447 178 182 Kilgore et al. 2010 Neuropsychopharmacology 35 870 880 . These demonstrations suggest that modulating memory via HDAC inhibition have considerable therapeutic potential for many memory and cognitive disorders.

Currently the role of individual HDACs in long term memory has been explored in two recent studies. Kilgore et al. 2010 Neuropsychopharmacology 35 870 880 revealed that nonspecific HDAC inhibitors such as sodium butyrate inhibit class I HDACs HDAC1 HDAC2 HDAC3 HDAC8 with little effect on the class IIa HDAC family members HDAC4 HDAC5 HDAC7 HDAC9 . This suggests that inhibition of class I HDACs may be critical for the enhancement of cognition observed in many studies. Indeed forebrain and neuron specific over expression of HDAC2 but not HDAC1 decreased dendritic spine density synaptic density synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Guan et al. 2009 Nature 459 55 60 . In contrast HDAC2 knockout mice exhibited increased synaptic density increased synaptic plasticity and increased dendritic density in neurons. These HDAC2 deficient mice also exhibited enhanced learning and memory in a battery of learning behavioral paradigms. This work demonstrates that HDAC2 is a key regulator of synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Additionally Guan et al. showed that chronic treatment of mice with SAHA an HDAC 1 2 3 6 8 inhibitor reproduced the effects seen in the HDAC2 deficient mice and recused the cognitive impairment in the HDAC2 overexpression mice. The inhibition of the HDAC2 selectively or in combination with other class I HDACs is an attractive target for enhancing cognition and facilitating the learning process through increasing synaptic and dendritic density in neuronal cell populations.

HDAC3 is the most highly expressed class I HDAC throughout the brain including the hippocampus Broide et al. 2007 J. Mol. Neurosci. 31 47 58 . HDAC3 alters gene expression as part of a large complex that contains corepressors nuclear receptor corepressor 1 NCoR and silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors SMRT as well as class IIa HDACs such as HDAC4 Guenther et al. 2000 Genes Dev. 14 1048 1057 Li et al. 2000 EMBO J. 19 4342 4350 for review see Karagianni 2007 Oncogene 26 5439 5449 . NCoR associates with HDAC3 through the deacetylase activation domain DAD of NCoR and a single amino acid substitution Y478A in the NCoR DAD results in a mutant protein that is unable to associate with or activate HDAC3 Alenghat et al. 2008 Nature 456 997 1000 . In addition class IIa HDACs may require interaction with HDAC3 for their HDAC activity Fischle et al. 2002 Mol. Cell 9 45 57 . It has been demonstrated that HDAC3 is a critical negative regulator of long term memory formation. Specifically focal deletion of HDAC3 as well as selective inhibition of HDAC3 significantly enhanced long term memory in a persistent manner McQuown 2011 31 2 764 774 .

A memory as used herein refers to the ability to recover information about past events or knowledge. Memories include short term memory also referred to as working or recent memory and long term memory. Short term memories involve recent events while long term memories relate to the recall of events of the more distant past. Methods of assessing the ability to recall a memory are known to those of skill in the art and may involve routine cognitive tests. Enhancing or retrieving memories is distinct from learning. However in some instances in the art learning is referred to as memory. Learning unlike memory enhancement refers to the ability to create new memories that had not previously existed. Thus in order to test the ability of a compound to effect the ability of a subject to learn rather than recall old memories the compound would be administered prior to or at the same time as the memory is created. In order to test the ability of a compound to affect recall of a previously created memory the compound is administered after the memory is created and preferably after the memory is lost.

As used herein age related memory loss refers to any of a continuum of conditions characterized by a deterioration of neurological functioning that does not rise to the level of a dementia as further defined herein and or as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition of the American Psychiatric Association DSM IV 1994 . Age related memory loss is characterized by objective loss of memory in an older subject compared to his or her younger years but cognitive test performance that is within normal limits for the subject s age. Age related memory loss subjects score within a normal range on standardized diagnostic tests for dementias as set forth by the DSM IV. Moreover the DSM IV provides separate diagnostic criteria for a condition termed Age Related Cognitive Decline. In the context of the present invention as well as the terms Age Associated Memory Impairment and Age Consistent Memory Decline are understood to be synonymous with the age related memory loss. Age related memory loss may include decreased brain weight gyral atrophy ventricular dilation and selective loss of neurons within different brain regions. For purposes of some embodiments of the present invention more progressive forms of memory loss are also included under the definition of age related memory disorder. Thus persons having greater than age normal memory loss and cognitive impairment yet scoring below the diagnostic threshold for frank dementia may be referred to as having a mild neurocognitive disorder mild cognitive impairment late life forgetfulness benign senescent forgetfulness incipient dementia provisional dementia and the like. Such subjects may be slightly more susceptible to developing frank dementia in later life See also US patent application 2006 008517 Vasogen Ireland limited which is incorporated by reference . Symptoms associated with age related memory loss include but are not limited to alterations in biochemical markers associated with the aging brain such as IL 1 beta IFN gamma p JNK p ERK reduction in synaptic activity or function such as synaptic plasticity evidenced by reduction in long term potentiation diminution of memory and learning.

As used herein injury related memory loss refers to a loss of memory wherein there is damage to the brain and there may have also been neurological damage. Sources of brain injury include traumatic brain injury such as concussive injuries or penetrating head wounds brain tumors alcoholism Alzheimer s disease stroke heart attack and other conditions that deprive the brain of oxygen meningitis AIDS viral encephalitis and hydrocephalus.

Methods for enhancing memories can include reestablishing access to memories as well as recapturing memories. The term re establishing access as used herein refers to increasing retrieval of a memory. Although Applicants are not bound by a mechanism of action it is believed that the compounds of the invention are effective in increasing retrieval of memories by re establishing a synaptic network. The process of re establishing a synaptic network may include an increase in the number of active brain synapses and or a reversal of neuronal loss.

Neurogenesis or the birth of new neuronal cells was thought to occur only in developing organisms. However recent research has demonstrated that neurogenesis does indeed continue into and throughout adult life. On going neurogenesis is thought to be an important mechanism underlying neuronal plasticity enabling organisms to adapt to environmental changes and influencing learning and memory throughout life. In one aspect the invention includes a method of increasing synaptic density in a subject comprising administering to the subject in need of such increase a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt hydrate solvate or prodrug thereof. In one aspect the invention includes a method of increasing synaptic plasticity in a subject comprising administering to the subject in need of such increase a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt hydrate solvate or prodrug thereof. In one aspect the invention includes a method of increasing dendritic density in neurons in a subject comprising administering to the subject in need of such increase a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt hydrate solvate or prodrug thereof.

The invention provides methods for enhancing memory in a subject having a memory disorder. Examples of types of memory disorders include Alzheimer s disease absent minded professor absent mindedness amnesia anterograde amnesia blackout alcohol related amnesia bromism childhood amnesia false memory syndrome fugue state hyperthymesia Korsakoff s syndrome lacunar amnesia memory distrust syndrome memory loss post traumatic amnesia prosopamnesia psychogenic amnesia repressed memory retrograde amnesia Ribot s Law selective memory loss sywald skeid source amnesia source monitoring error the seven sins of memory tip of the tongue transient epileptic amensia transient global amnesia and twilight sleep.

In one embodiment Alzheimer s disease is the memory disorder. Such methods optionally involve administering the inhibitor and monitoring the subject to identify recapture of a memory that was previously lost. Subjects may be monitored by routine tests known in the art.

In other embodiments the alzheimer s subject is one that has late stage Alzheimer s disease. Many of the drugs suggested for treating Alzheimer s disease are designed to treat the early stages of the disease by preventing plaque buildup. The compounds of the invention are useful for treating both early stages and late stages of dementia because they actually improve memory and cognition rather than preventing only plaque accumulation.

The invention relates to methods of treating alleviating and or preventing cognitive function disorders impairments.

Impaired cognitive function refers to cognitive function that is not as robust as that observed in an age matched normal subject and includes states in which cognitive function is reduced. In some cases cognitive function is reduced by about 5 about 10 about 30 or more compared to cognitive function measured in an age matched normal subject. Cognitive function may be promoted to any detectable degree but in humans preferably is promoted sufficiently to allow an impaired subject to carry out daily activities of normal life.

In some embodiments the cognitive function disorders or impairments are associated with but not limited to Alzheimer s disease Huntington s disease seizure induced memory loss schizophrenia Rubinstein Taybi syndrome Rett Syndrome Fragile X Lewey body dementia Vascular dementia bipolar disorder and social cognitive and learning disorders associated with autism attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD dyselexia learning disorders traumatic head injury stroke induced cognitive and motor impairment traumatic brain injury neurodegeneration and neuronal loss mediated cognitive impairment and attention deficit disorder.

In some embodiments the cognitive function disorders or impairments are associated with but not limited to anxiety disorders conditioned fear response panic disorders obsessive compulsive disorders post traumatic stress disorder phobias social anxiety disorders substance dependence recovery or Age Associated Memory Impairment AAMI and Age Related Cognitive Decline ARCD .

In some embodiments the invention relates to methods of treating alleviating and or preventing vascular dementia. Vascular dementia also referred to as multi infarct dementia refers to a group of syndromes caused by different mechanisms all resulting in vascular lesions in the brain. The main subtypes of vascular dementia are for example vascular mild cognitive impairment multi infarct dementia vascular dementia due to a strategic single infarct affecting the thalamus the anterior cerebral artery the parietal lobes or the cingulate gyms vascular dementia due to hemorrhagic lesions small vessel disease including e.g. vascular dementia due to lacunar lesions and Binswanger disease and mixed Alzheimer s Disease with vascular dementia.

In some embodiments the invention relates to treating alleviating and or preventing Huntington s Disease. Huntington s Disease is a neurological disease which results in cognitive decline associated with inexorable progression to death. Cognitive symptoms associated with Huntington s Disease include loss of intellectual speed attention and short term memory and or behavioral symptoms.

Cognitive function may be assessed and thus optionally defined via one or more tests or assays for cognitive function. Non limiting examples of a test or assay for cognitive function include CANTAB see for example Fray et al. CANTAB battery proposed utility in neurotoxicology. Neurotoxicol Teratol 1996 18 4 499 504 Stroop Test Trail Making Wechsler Digit Span or the CogState computerized cognitive test see also Dehaene et al. Reward dependent learning in neuronal networks for planning and decision making. Brain Res. 2000 126 21729 Iverson et al. Interpreting change on the WAIS III WMS III in clinical samples. Arch Clin Neuropsychol. 2001 16 2 183 91 and Weaver et al. Mild memory impairment in healthy older adults is distinct from normal aging. Cogn. 2006 60 2 146 55 . The methods of the invention may be used to promote cognitive function in a normal subject or to treat alleviate and or prevent a subject from having a cognitive dysfunction. A normal subject as used herein is a subject that has not been diagnosed with a disorder associated with impaired cognitive function.

In one aspect the invention relates to methods of treating alleviating and or preventing extinction learning disorders e.g. a fear extinction deficit.

It has been demonstrated that administration of the HDAC inhibitors sodium butyrate or trichostatin A facilitates fear extinction in mice and this enhancement mirrors that caused by commonly used behavioral manipulation and is consistent with other studies demonstrating a role for the hippocampus in the extinction of contextual fear Lattal et al. 2007 Behav. Neurosci. 121 5 1125 1131 .

Compounds of the invention can be used to facilitate the psychological process of extinction learning and thus are useful for treating alleviating and or preventing neuropsychiatric disorders and other related disorders. Unlike traditional anti anxiety drugs that are administered on a chronic basis and address physiological symptoms of anxiety the compounds of the invention can be used on a chronic or acute basis in conjunction with a second therapy e.g. psychotherapy.

In one aspect the present invention is directed to methods for treating alleviating and or preventing a subject from having a neuropsychiatric disorder. The methods comprise subjecting the subject to one or more sessions of a combination therapy protocol where the combination therapy protocol comprises an acute administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention that enhances learning or conditioning in combination with a session of psychotherapy. By acute administration is intended a single exposure of the subject to the therapeutically effective amount of the compound that enhances learning or conditioning. In one aspect the exposure to the compound occurs within about 24 hours prior to initiating the session of psychotherapy preferably within about 12 hours and more preferably within about 6 hours prior to initiating the session of psychotherapy. A full course of treatment for the neuropsychiatric disorder entails at least one session of this combination therapy protocol.

For purposes of the present invention a subject may have a single disorder or may have a constellation of disorders that are to be treated alleviated and or prevented by the methods described herein.

The neuropsychiatric disorders contemplated in the present invention include but are not limited to fear and anxiety disorders addictive disorders including substance abuse disorders and mood disorders. Within the fear and anxiety disorder category the invention encompasses the treatment or prevention of panic disorder specific phobia post traumatic stress disorder PTSD obsessive compulsive disorder and movement disorders such as Tourette s syndrome. The disorders contemplated herein are defined in for example the DSM IV Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th ed. American Psychiatric Association Washington D.C. 1994 which is herein incorporated by reference.

Anxiety related disorders relate to those disorders characterized by fear anxiety addiction and the like. Patients with anxiety related disorders can have a single such disorder or can have a constellation of disorders. The anxiety related disorders contemplated in the present invention include but are not limited to anxiety disorders addictive disorders including substance abuse disorders mood disorders e.g. depression and or bipolar disorder movement disorders such as Tourette s syndrome psychogenic erectile dysfunction impotence resulting from a man s inability to obtain or maintain an erection of his penis insomnia e.g. chronic insomnia and eating disorders e.g. anorexia .

Anxiety disorders include but are not limited to panic disorder agoraphobia social phobia specific phobia PTSD obsessive compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. The disorders contemplated herein are defined in for example the DSM IV Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th ed. American Psychiatric Association Washington D.C. 1994 .

Movement disorders are neurological conditions that affect the speed fluency quality and ease of movement. Representative movement disorders include but are not limited to ataxia chorea myoclonus dystonia Parkinson s disease restless leg syndrome tics and Tourette s syndrome. Movement disorders typically occur as a result of damage or disease in the basal ganglia region of the brain. Movement disorders can result from age related changes medications genetic disorders metabolic disorders disease stroke or injury. Recovery of movement after stroke or injury may be facilitated when treated according to the methods of the invention.

Addictive disorders are disorders characterized by addiction to an activity or substance and include for example alcohol addiction drug addiction and gambling addiction.

Depression refers to the clinical condition known as major depressive disorder and is characterized by a state of intense sadness melancholia or despair that has advanced to the point of being disruptive to an individual s social functioning and or activities of daily living. Depression is alleviated if either or both the severity or frequency of a symptom of the depression is reduced. However a subject can be treated for depression in accordance with the methods of the invention irrespective of whether the treatment actually was successful in alleviating the depression.

Insomnia is defined herein as the inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep for a sufficient amount of time during regular sleeping hours. It includes acute insomnia which occurs in either a transient or short term form and chronic insomnia. It also includes initial insomnia defined as difficulty in falling asleep middle insomnia defined as awakening in the middle of the night followed by eventually falling back to sleep but with difficulty and terminal insomnia defined as awakening before one s usual waking time and being unable to return to sleep.

As defined by the National Institute of Mental Health Autism Spectrum Disorders ASD also widely known as Pervasive Developmental Disorders PDDs cause severe and pervasive impairment in thinking feeling language and the ability to relate to others. These disorders are usually first diagnosed in early childhood and range from a severe form called autistic disorder through pervasive development disorder not otherwise specified PDD NOS to a much milder form Asperger syndrome. They also include two rare disorders Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder.

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ADHD is one of the most common mental disorders that develop in children. Children with ADHD typically have impaired functioning in multiple settings including home school and in relationships with peers. Symptoms of ADHD include impulsiveness hyperactivity and inattention.

Typical treatments encompassed by the present invention include combination therapies. For instance the combination therapy may be a pharmacotherapy i.e. a compound of the invention and a behavioral therapy. Behavioral therapy comprises but is not limited to electroconvulsive seizure therapy exercise group therapy talk therapy or conditioning. In another embodiment the behavioral therapy is cognitive behavioral therapy. Examples of behavioral therapy that may be used in the ongoing methods are described for example in Cognitive Behavioral Therapies by K. Dobson ed. Guilford Publications Inc. 2002 The new Handbook of Cognitive Therapy Basics and Beyond by Judith S. S. Beck Guilford Publications Inc. 1995 herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. Any pharmaceutical active ingredient that is recognized by the skilled artisan as being a pharmacologic agent that enhances learning or conditioning can be used in the methods of the invention. For example one such class of pharmaceutical active ingredients contemplated herein comprises compounds that increase the level of norepinephrine in the brain. Such compounds include those acting as norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors for example tomoxetine reboxetine duloxetine venlafaxine and milnacipran and those compounds that cause release of norepinephrine for example amphetamine dextroamphetamine pemoline and methylphenidate. Another class of such pharmaceutical active ingredients is those compounds that increase the level of acetylcholine in the brain including for example compounds that block its breakdown. Examples of such compounds include but are not limited to donepezil HCl or Aricept and tacrine which inhibit cholinesterase activity.

Methods of the invention also encompass the use in combination with a compound of the invention of any type of psychotherapy that is suitable for the particular psychiatric disorder for which the subject is undergoing treatment. Suitable methods of psychotherapy include exposure based psychotherapy cognitive psychotherapy and psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy. Methods of the invention also encompass exposing the subject to cognitive behavioral therapy CBT behavioral exposure treatments virtual reality exposure VRE or cognitive remediation therapy.

Methods of the invention also encompass extinction training. The goal of extinction training is to pair a stimulus that previously provoked a deleterious unwanted response with a new learning that will not lead to a negative outcome thereby generating in a subject a new more appropriate response to the stimulus to compete with and ideally replace the previous undesirable response. Extinction training frequently exposes a subject to a stimulus or situation in the absence of an aversive consequence e.g. a subject that has deleterious high anxiety responses to a given stimulus or situation is exposed to that stimulus or situation in the absence of an aversive consequence. A typical goal of extinction training is to produce new learning in the subject that results from the pairing of the original stimulus or situation with a non deleterious outcome thereby generating in subsequent exposures to the stimulus a more appropriate response in place of the unwanted response. An extinction learning event refers to a completed stimulus response extinction training cycle.

One form of extinction training entails psychotherapy. For example the methods of the invention contemplate treating alleviating and or preventing anxiety disorders by i administering psychotherapy to treat alleviate and or prevent an anxiety related disorder in a suitable human subject and ii administering a therapeutically effective dose a compound of the invention to said subject on an achronic post training pre sleep basis. Suitable methods of psychotherapy include but are not limited to exposure based psychotherapy cognitive psychotherapy and psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy.

One method of psychotherapy that is specifically contemplated is the use of virtual reality VR exposure therapy to treat alleviate and or prevent an anxiety disorder using the methods of the invention.

Another method of psychotherapy that is particularly beneficial when utilized in combination with a compound or composition of the present invention is cognitive behavioral therapy CBT . CBT is a form of psychotherapy that combines cognitive therapy and behavior therapy and emphasizes the critical role of thinking in causing people to act and feel as they do. Therefore if an individual is experiencing unwanted feelings and behaviors CBT teaches that it is important to identify the thinking that is causing the undesirable feelings and or behaviors and to learn how to replace this deleterious thinking with thoughts that lead to more desirable reactions. CBT is widely used to help people who are experiencing a range of mental health difficulties some of which do not conveniently fit definitions of a particular medical affliction. CBT has been used to treat anxiety disorders mood disorders addictive disorders eating disorders insomnia chronic pain schizophrenia fibromyalgia ADHD and autism spectrum disorders among others. Post extinction training pre sleep administration of a compound of the invention subsequent to CBT treatment can be used to augment the effectiveness of the CBT treatment for these medical conditions.

In one embodiment subjects suffering from social anxiety disorder undergo weekly cognitive behavioral therapy sessions to treat the affliction. After each therapy session subjects are administered a therapeutically effective formulation of compounds of the invention on a post extinction training pre sleep basis. Relative to subjects treated only via cognitive behavioral therapy or to subjects treated via cognitive behavioral therapy and a placebo anxiety associated with social anxiety disorder is expected to be reduced to a greater extent in subjects treated with a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and achronic administration of a compound of the invention on a post extinction training pre sleep basis.

In another embodiment of the invention a compound of the invention is administered after extinction training only if the extinction training yields positive results on that day. For example a subject undergoing cognitive behavioral therapy for PTSD is administered a compound of the invention on a post extinction training only if the cognitive behavioral therapy was deemed to be successful as determined by the subject and or therapist. In one aspect the compound is administered on a post extinction pre sleep basis. In another aspect a subject undergoing cognitive behavioral therapy for PTSD is administered a compound of the invention on a pre extinction training. In one aspect the compound is administered on a pre extinction pre sleep basis. This method may also be useful when applied to treatment of autism spectrum disorders or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

In another embodiment of the invention subjects afflicted with anxiety disorders such as PTSD receive extinction training using Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing EMDR and subsequently are administered a therapeutically effective dose of a compound of the invention on a post extinction training pre sleep basis. Another form of extinction training is provided by biofeedback which is particularly useful in enabling subjects to learn to control physiological processes that normally occur involuntarily such as blood pressure heart rate muscle tension and skin temperature. As used herein biofeedback refers to a technique in which subjects are trained to improve their health by using signals from their own bodies to control their own physiological responses.

In one embodiment of the invention a subject suffering from chronic pain undergoes biofeedback sessions to help alleviate the pain. Upon the conclusion of each session wherein the subject has made progress in learning developing responses that reduce the chronic pain the subject is administered a compound of the invention on a post extinction training pre sleep basis in order to consolidate the desired learning.

In another embodiment a subject suffering from phantom limb syndrome undergoes thermal biofeedback sessions to reduce and hopefully eliminate the symptoms. After each session the subject is administered a therapeutically effective formulation of a compound of the invention on a post extinction training pre sleep basis.

In another embodiment extinction training can be provided by physical therapy or virtual reality physical therapy such as virtual reality gait therapy. For example a stroke victim re learning how to walk can undergo virtual reality gait therapy and then be administered a compound of the invention on an achronic post extinction training pre sleep basis.

Another form of extinction training can be provided by pharmacotherapy. For example a man afflicted with erectile dysfunction can have an extinction learning event based on a positive sexual outcome including instances wherein the positive sexual outcome was achieved with the pharmacological assistance of a PDE 5 inhibitor such as sildenafil tadalafil vardenafil and or udenafil. By administering a compound of the invention on a post extinction training pre sleep basis to a subject with erectile dysfunction following a successful sexual outcome wherein the subject utilized sildenafil the heightened confidence and reduced sexual performance anxiety resulting from a successful outcome can be consolidated in said subject s psyche thereby facilitating extinction of any deleterious performance anxiety associated with sexual intercourse.

Extinction training does not always require intervention of a trained specialist. Individuals can carry out extinction training on themselves.

In some aspects the invention relates to a method for treating alleviating and or preventing a fungal disease or infection comprising administering to a subject a compound of the invention. The invention provides a method for treating alleviating and or preventing a hospital acquired fungal infections that attack immunocompromised patients including those with HIV and cancer. In one embodiment the invention provides a method for treating alleviating and or preventing a fungal disease in a subject not suffering from cancer.

In some aspects the invention relates to a method for treating alleviating and or preventing an inflammatory disease including but not limited to stroke rheumatoid arthritis lupus erythematosus ulcerative colitis and traumatic brain injuries Leoni et al. PNAS 99 5 2995 3000 2002 Suuronen et al. J. Neurochem. 87 407 416 2003 and Drug Discovery Today 10 197 204 2005 .

In some embodiments the instant compounds are useful in the treatment alleviation and or preventing of cancers that include but are not limited to leukemias including acute leukemias and chronic leukemias such as acute lymphocytic leukemia ALL Acute myeloid leukemia AML chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL chronic myelogenous leukemia CML and Hairy Cell Leukemia lymphomas such as cutaneous T cell lymphomas CTCL noncutaneous peripheral T cell lymphomas lymphomas associated with human T cell lymphotrophic virus HTLV such as adult T cell leukemia lymphoma ATLL Hodgkin s disease and non Hodgkin s lymphomas large cell lymphomas diffuse large B cell lymphoma DLBCL Burkitt s lymphoma mesothelioma primary central nervous system CNS lymphoma multiple myeloma childhood solid tumors such as brain tumors neuroblastoma retinoblastoma Wilm s tumor bone tumors and soft tissue sarcomas common solid tumors of adults such as head and neck cancers e.g. oral laryngeal and esophageal genito urinary cancers e.g. prostate bladder renal uterine ovarian testicular rectal and colon lung cancer breast cancer pancreatic cancer melanoma and other skin cancers stomach cancer brain tumors liver cancer and thyroid cancer.

In some aspects the invention relates to methods of treating alleviating or preventing hematolical diseases. Hematologic diseases include abnormal growth of blood cells which can lead to dysplastic changes in blood cells and hematologic malignancies such as various leukemias. Examples of hematologic diseases include but are not limited to acute myeloid leukemia acute promyelocytic leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia chronic myelogenous leukemia the myelodysplastic syndromes and sickle cell anemia.

Acute myeloid leukemia AML is the most common type of acute leukemia that occurs in adults. Several inherited genetic disorders and immunodeficiency states are associated with an increased risk of AML. These include disorders with defects in DNA stability leading to random chormosomal breakage such as Bloom s syndrome Fanconi s anemia Li Fraumeni kindreds ataxia telangiectasia and X linked agammaglobulinemia.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia APML represents a distinct subgroup of AML. This subtype is characterized by promyelocytic blasts containing the 15 17 chromosomal translocation. This translocation leads to the generation of the fusion transcript comprised of the retinoic acid receptor and a sequence PML.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL is a heterogenerous disease with distinct clinical features displayed by various subtypes. Reoccurring cytogenetic abnormalities have been demonstrated in ALL. The most common cytogenetic abnormality is the 9 22 translocation. The resultant Philadelphia chromosome represents poor prognosis of the patient.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia CML is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder of a pluripotent stem cell. CML is characterized by a specific chromosomal abnormality involving the translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22 creating the Philadelphia chromosome. Ionizing radiation is associated with the development of CML.

The myelodysplastic syndromes MDS are heterogeneous clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders grouped together because of the presence of dysplastic changes in one or more of the hematopoietic lineages including dysplastic changes in the myeloid erythroid and megakaryocytic series. These changes result in cytopenias in one or more of the three lineages. Patients afflicted with MDS typically develop complications related to anemia neutropenia infections or thrombocytopenia bleeding . Generally from about 10 to about 70 of patients with MDS develop acute leukemia.

Sickle cell disease is attributable to homozygous inheritance of a single amino acid substitution in the globin gene that leads to polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin deformation of red blood cells microvascular occlusion hemolysis and consequent disease manifestations including pain strokes and pulmonary complications Bunn H F 1997 J. Med. 337 762 769 . Abundant biochemical epidemiological and clinical evidence have shown that a high level of globin the fetal form of globin inhibits the aberrant polymerization of sickle hemoglobin and ameliorates the disease phenotype. The only Food and Drug Administration FDA approved drug for sickle cell disease hydroxyurea causes significant induction of fetal hemoglobin decreased disease severity and benefits overall mortality Letvin et al. 1984 N Engl J Med 310 869 873 Platt O S et al. 1984 J Clin Invest 74 652 656 Charache S et al. 1995 N Engl J. Med 332 317 1322 Steinberg M H et al. 2003 JAMA 289 1645 1651 . Nevertheless hydroxyurea has bone marrow suppressive effects and is ineffective in a significant portion of patients Charache S et al. Steinberg M H et al. 2003 Steinberg M H 1999 N Engl J. Med 340 1021 1030 . A drug that induces fetal hemoglobin more substantially with less myelosuppression would be expected to have greater therapeutic utility in sickle cell disease.

Transcriptional regulation of the human globin gene locus has been investigated intensively. Gamma globin gene expression is influenced by transcription factors GATA 1 EKLF NF E4p22 Ikaros and chromatin modifying enzymes SWI SNF complex HATs and histone deacetylase HDACs as part of multiprotein complexes and a unique dynamic chromatin structure termed the globin active chromatin hub ACH 8 11 .

Polymorphisms in BCL11A a transcriptional repressor alter baseline fetal hemoglobin levels and a multiprotein complex containing BCL11a binds to the globin locus resulting in repression of globin expression Menzel S et al. 2007 Nat Genet 39 1197 1199 Lettre G et al. 2008 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105 11869 11874 Sankaran V G et al. 2008 Science 322 1839 1842 Uda M et al. 2008 Proc NATL Acad Sci USA 105 1620 1625 Sankaran V G et al. 2009 Nature 460 1093 1097 . Despite this granularity discrete targets amenable to ligand discovery efforts have not been identified and functionally validated.

The induction of fetal hemoglobin is a validated strategy to improve symptoms and complications of sickle cell disease. The development of targeted therapies has been limited by the absence of discrete druggable targets. Bradner et al. 2010 PNAS 107 28 12617 12622 has developed a unique bead based strategy for the identification of inducers of fetal hemoglobin transcripts in primary human erythroid cells which includes a small molecule screen of bioactive compounds that have been identified to have remarkable class associated activity among histone deacetylase HDAC inhibitors. Using a chemical genetic strategy combining focused libraries of biased chemical probes and reverse genetics by RNA interference Bradner et al. identified HDAC1 and HDAC2 as molecular targets mediating fetal hemoglobin induction. Isoform selective inhibitors of HDAC1 and HDAC2 are targets for the treatment of sickle cell disease.

The compounds of the invention may be administered alone e.g. in saline or buffer or using any delivery vehicles known in the art. For instance the following delivery vehicles have been described Cochleates Emulsomes ISCOMs Liposomes Live bacterial vectors e.g. Live viral vectors e.g. Vaccinia adenovirus Herpes Simplex Microspheres Nucleic acid vaccines Polymers Polymer rings Proteosomes Sodium Fluoride Transgenic plants Virosomes Virus like particles. Other delivery vehicles are known in the art and some additional examples are provided below.

The term an effective amount of a compound of the invention refers to the amount necessary or sufficient to realize a desired biologic effect. For example an effective amount of a compound of the invention is that amount sufficient to treat a condition. In another aspect an effective amount of a compound is that amount sufficient to alleviate a condition. In another aspect an effective amount of a compound is that amount sufficient to prevent a condition. Combined with the teachings provided herein by choosing among the various active compounds and weighing factors such as potency relative bioavailability patient body weight severity of adverse side effects and preferred mode of administration an effective prophylactic or therapeutic treatment regimen can be planned which does not cause substantial toxicity and yet is entirely effective to treat the particular subject. The effective amount for any particular application can vary depending on such factors as the condition being treated the particular compounds being administered the size of the subject or the severity of the condition.

The compounds of the invention may be administered by any route known such as for example orally transdermally intravenously cutaneously subcutaneously nasally intramuscularly intraperitoneally intracranially and intracerebroventricularly.

In certain embodiments compounds of the invention are administered at dosage levels greater than about 0.001 mg kg such as greater than about 0.01 mg kg or greater than about 0.1 mg kg. For example the dosage level may be from about 0.001 mg kg to about 50 mg kg such as from about 0.01 mg kg to about 25 mg kg from about 0.1 mg kg to about 10 mg kg or from about 1 mg kg to about 5 mg kg of subject body weight per day one or more times a day to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. It will also be appreciated that dosages smaller than 0.001 mg kg or greater than 50 mg kg for example 50 100 mg kg can also be administered to a subject.

In one embodiment the compound of the invention is administered once daily twice daily or three times daily. In one embodiment the compound of the invention is administered continuously i.e. every day or intermittently e.g. 3 5 days a week . In another embodiment administration could be on an intermittent schedule.

Further administration less frequently than daily such as for example every other day may be chosen. In additional embodiments administration with at least 2 days between doses may be chosen. By way of example only dosing may be every third day bi weekly or weekly. As another example a single acute dose may be administered. Alternatively compounds of the invention can be administered on a non regular basis e.g. whenever symptoms begin. For any compound described herein the effective amount can be initially determined from animal models.

Toxicity and efficacy of the compounds of the invention can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals e.g. for determining the LD50 the dose lethal to 50 of the population and the ED50 the dose therapeutically effective in 50 of the population . The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50 ED50. Compounds that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and thereby reduce side effects.

Data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage of the compounds of the invention for use in humans. The dosage of such agents lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention the effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 i.e. the concentration of the test compound that achieves a half maximal inhibition of symptoms as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured for example by high performance liquid chromatography. In certain embodiments pharmaceutical compositions may comprise for example at least about 0.1 of an active compound. In other embodiments the an active compound may comprise between about 2 to about 75 of the weight of the unit or between about 25 to about 60 for example and any range derivable therein. Multiple doses of the compounds of the invention are also contemplated.

The formulations of the invention are administered in pharmaceutically acceptable solutions which may routinely contain pharmaceutically acceptable concentrations of salt buffering agents preservatives compatible carriers and optionally other therapeutic ingredients.

For use in therapy an effective amount of one or more compounds of the invention can be administered to a subject by any mode that delivers the compound s to the desired surface e.g. mucosal systemic. Administering the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be accomplished by any means known to the skilled artisan. Compounds of the invention may be administered orally transdermally intravenously cutaneously subcutaneously nasally intramuscularly intraperitoneally intracranially or intracerebroventricularly.

For oral administration one or more compounds of the invention can be formulated readily by combining the active compound s with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art. Such carriers enable the compounds of the invention to be formulated as tablets pills dragees capsules liquids gels syrups slurries suspensions and the like for oral ingestion by a subject to be treated.

Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained as solid excipient optionally grinding a resulting mixture and processing the mixture of granules after adding suitable auxiliaries if desired to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are in particular fillers such as sugars including lactose sucrose mannitol or sorbitol cellulose preparations such as for example maize starch wheat starch rice starch potato starch gelatin gum tragacanth methyl cellulose hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose sodium carboxymethylcellulose and or polyvinylpyrrolidone PVP . If desired disintegrating agents may be added such as the cross linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone agar or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate. Optionally the oral formulations may also be formulated in saline or buffers i.e. EDTA for neutralizing internal acid conditions or may be administered without any carriers.

Also specifically contemplated are oral dosage forms of one or more compounds of the invention. The compound s may be chemically modified so that oral delivery of the derivative is efficacious. Generally the chemical modification contemplated is the attachment of at least one moiety to the compound itself where said moiety permits a inhibition of proteolysis and b uptake into the blood stream from the stomach or intestine. Also desired is the increase in overall stability of the compound s and increase in circulation time in the body. Examples of such moieties include polyethylene glycol copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol carboxymethyl cellulose dextran polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl pyrrolidone and polyproline. Abuchowski and Davis 1981 Soluble Polymer Enzyme Adducts In Enzymes as Drugs Hocenberg and Roberts eds. Wiley Interscience New York N.Y. pp. 367 383 Newmark et al. 1982 J. Appl. Biochem. 4 185 189. Other polymers that could be used are poly 1 3 dioxolane and poly 1 3 6 tioxocane. Preferred for pharmaceutical usage as indicated above are polyethylene glycol moieties.

The location of release may be the stomach the small intestine the duodenum the jejunum or the ileum or the large intestine. One skilled in the art has available formulations which will not dissolve in the stomach yet will release the material in the duodenum or elsewhere in the intestine. Preferably the release will avoid the deleterious effects of the stomach environment either by protection of the compound or by release of the biologically active material beyond the stomach environment such as in the intestine.

To ensure full gastric resistance a coating impermeable to at least pH 5.0 is important. Examples of the more common inert ingredients that are used as enteric coatings are cellulose acetate trimellitate CAT hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate HPMCP HPMCP 50 HPMCP 55 polyvinyl acetate phthalate PVAP Eudragit L30D Aquateric cellulose acetate phthalate CAP Eudragit L Eudragit S and Shellac. These coatings may be used as mixed films.

A coating or mixture of coatings can also be used on tablets which are not intended for protection against the stomach. This can include sugar coatings or coatings which make the tablet easier to swallow. Capsules may consist of a hard shell such as gelatin for delivery of dry therapeutic i.e. powder for liquid forms a soft gelatin shell may be used. The shell material of cachets could be thick starch or other edible paper. For pills lozenges molded tablets or tablet triturates moist massing techniques can be used.

The compound of the invention can be included in the formulation as fine multiparticulates in the form of granules or pellets of particle size about 1 mm. The formulation of the material for capsule administration could also be as a powder lightly compressed plugs or even as tablets. The compound of the invention could be prepared by compression.

Colorants and flavoring agents may all be included. For example the compound of the invention may be formulated such as by liposome or microsphere encapsulation and then further contained within an edible product such as a refrigerated beverage containing colorants and flavoring agents.

One may dilute or increase the volume of compound delivered with an inert material. These diluents could include carbohydrates especially mannitol a lactose anhydrous lactose cellulose sucrose modified dextrans and starch. Certain inorganic salts may be also be used as fillers including calcium triphosphate magnesium carbonate and sodium chloride. Some commercially available diluents are Fast Flo Emdex STA Rx 1500 Emcompress and Avicell. Disintegrants may be included in the formulation of the therapeutic into a solid dosage form. Materials used as disintegrates include but are not limited to starch including the commercial disintegrant based on starch Explotab. Sodium starch glycolate Amberlite sodium carboxymethylcellulose ultramylopectin sodium alginate gelatin orange peel acid carboxymethyl cellulose natural sponge and bentonite may all be used. Another form of the disintegrants is the insoluble cationic exchange resins. Powdered gums may be used as disintegrants and as binders and these can include powdered gums such as agar Karaya or tragacanth. Alginic acid and its sodium salt are also useful as disintegrants.

Binders may be used to hold the therapeutic together to form a hard tablet and include materials from natural products such as acacia tragacanth starch and gelatin. Others include methyl cellulose MC ethyl cellulose EC and carboxymethyl cellulose CMC . Polyvinyl pyrrolidone PVP and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose HPMC could both be used in alcoholic solutions to granulate the therapeutic.

An anti frictional agent may be included in the formulation of the compound of the invention to prevent sticking during the formulation process. Lubricants may be used as a layer between the compound and the die wall and these can include but are not limited to stearic acid including its magnesium and calcium salts polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE liquid paraffin vegetable oils and waxes. Soluble lubricants may also be used such as sodium lauryl sulfate magnesium lauryl sulfate polyethylene glycol of various molecular weights Carbowax 4000 and 6000. Glidants that might improve the flow properties of the drug during formulation and to aid rearrangement during compression might be added. The glidants may include starch talc pyrogenic silica and hydrated silicoaluminate.

To aid dissolution of the compound into the aqueous environment a surfactant might be added as a wetting agent. Surfactants may include anionic detergents such as sodium lauryl sulfate dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate and dioctyl sodium sulfonate. Cationic detergents might be used and could include benzalkonium chloride or benzethomium chloride. The list of potential non ionic detergents that could be included in the formulation as surfactants are lauromacrogol 400 polyoxyl 40 stearate polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 10 50 and 60 glycerol monostearate polysorbate 40 60 65 and 80 sucrose fatty acid ester methyl cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose. These surfactants could be present in the formulation of the compound either alone or as a mixture in different ratios.

Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include push fit capsules made of gelatin as well as soft sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose binders such as starches and or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and optionally stabilizers. In soft capsules the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids such as fatty oils liquid paraffin or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition stabilizers may be added. Microspheres formulated for oral administration may also be used. Such microspheres have been well defined in the art. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration.

For buccal administration the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner.

For administration by inhalation the compounds for use according to the present invention may be conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebulizer with the use of a suitable propellant e.g. dichlorodifluoromethane trichlorofluoromethane dichlorotetrafluoroethane carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of e.g. gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.

Also contemplated herein is pulmonary delivery of the compounds of the invention. The compound is delivered to the lungs of a mammal while inhaling and traverses across the lung epithelial lining to the blood stream.

No. 5 451 569 issued Sep. 19 1995 to Wong et al.

Contemplated for use in the practice of this invention are a wide range of mechanical devices designed for pulmonary delivery of therapeutic products including but not limited to nebulizers metered dose inhalers and powder inhalers all of which are familiar to those skilled in the art. Some specific examples of commercially available devices suitable for the practice of this invention are the Ultravent nebulizer manufactured by Mallinckrodt Inc. St. Louis Mo. the Acorn II nebulizer manufactured by Marquest Medical Products Englewood Colo. the Ventolin metered dose inhaler manufactured by Glaxo Inc. Research Triangle Park N.C. and the Spinhaler powder inhaler manufactured by Fisons Corp. Bedford Mass.

All such devices require the use of formulations suitable for the dispensing of compound. Typically each formulation is specific to the type of device employed and may involve the use of an appropriate propellant material in addition to the usual diluents and or carriers useful in therapy. Also the use of liposomes microcapsules or microspheres inclusion complexes or other types of carriers is contemplated. Chemically modified compound may also be prepared in different formulations depending on the type of chemical modification or the type of device employed. Formulations suitable for use with a nebulizer either jet or ultrasonic will typically comprise compound dissolved in water at a concentration of about 0.1 to 25 mg of biologically active compound per mL of solution. The formulation may also include a buffer and a simple sugar e.g. for stabilization and regulation of osmotic pressure . The nebulizer formulation may also contain a surfactant to reduce or prevent surface induced aggregation of the compound caused by atomization of the solution in forming the aerosol.

Formulations for use with a metered dose inhaler device will generally comprise a finely divided powder containing the compound suspended in a propellant with the aid of a surfactant. The propellant may be any conventional material employed for this purpose such as a chlorofluorocarbon a hydrochlorofluorocarbon a hydrofluorocarbon or a hydrocarbon including trichlorofluoromethane dichlorodifluoromethane dichlorotetrafluoroethanol and 1 1 1 2 tetrafluoroethane or combinations thereof. Suitable surfactants include sorbitan trioleate and soya lecithin. Oleic acid may also be useful as a surfactant.

Formulations for dispensing from a powder inhaler device will comprise a finely divided dry powder containing compound and may also include a bulking agent such as lactose sorbitol sucrose or mannitol in amounts which facilitate dispersal of the powder from the device e.g. 50 to 90 by weight of the formulation. The compound should most advantageously be prepared in particulate form with an average particle size of less than 10 mm or microns most preferably 0.5 to 5 mm for most effective delivery to the distal lung.

Nasal delivery of a compound of the invention is also contemplated. Nasal delivery allows the passage of a compound of the present invention to the blood stream directly after administering the therapeutic product to the nose without the necessity for deposition of the product in the lung. Formulations for nasal delivery include those with dextran or cyclodextran.

For nasal administration a useful device is a small hard bottle to which a metered dose sprayer is attached. In one embodiment the metered dose is delivered by drawing the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention solution into a chamber of defined volume which chamber has an aperture dimensioned to aerosolize and aerosol formulation by forming a spray when a liquid in the chamber is compressed. The chamber is compressed to administer the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. In a specific embodiment the chamber is a piston arrangement. Such devices are commercially available.

Alternatively a plastic squeeze bottle with an aperture or opening dimensioned to aerosolize an aerosol formulation by forming a spray when squeezed is used. The opening is usually found in the top of the bottle and the top is generally tapered to partially fit in the nasal passages for efficient administration of the aerosol formulation. Preferably the nasal inhaler will provide a metered amount of the aerosol formulation for administration of a measured dose of the drug.

The compound when it is desirable to deliver them systemically may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection e.g. by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form e.g. in ampoules or in multi dose containers with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending stabilizing and or dispersing agents.

Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water soluble form. Additionally suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions.

Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil or synthetic fatty acid esters such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose sorbitol or dextran. Optionally the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.

Alternatively the active compounds may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle e.g. sterile pyrogen free water before use.

The compounds may also be formulated in rectal or vaginal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas e.g. containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.

In addition to the formulations described previously the compounds may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil or ion exchange resins or as sparingly soluble derivatives for example as a sparingly soluble salt.

The pharmaceutical compositions also may comprise suitable solid or gel phase carriers or excipients. Examples of such carriers or excipients include but are not limited to calcium carbonate calcium phosphate various sugars starches cellulose derivatives gelatin and polymers such as polyethylene glycols.

Suitable liquid or solid pharmaceutical preparation forms are for example aqueous or saline solutions for inhalation microencapsulated encochleated coated onto microscopic gold particles contained in liposomes nebulized aerosols pellets for implantation into the skin or dried onto a sharp object to be scratched into the skin. The pharmaceutical compositions also include granules powders tablets coated tablets micro capsules suppositories syrups emulsions suspensions creams drops or preparations with protracted release of active compounds in whose preparation excipients and additives and or auxiliaries such as disintegrants binders coating agents swelling agents lubricants flavorings sweeteners or solubilizers are customarily used as described above. The pharmaceutical compositions are suitable for use in a variety of drug delivery systems. For a brief review of methods for drug delivery see Langer Science 249 1527 1533 1990 which is incorporated herein by reference.

The compounds of the invention may be administered per se neat or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. When used in medicine the salts should be pharmaceutically acceptable but non pharmaceutically acceptable salts may conveniently be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Such salts include but are not limited to those prepared from the following acids hydrochloric hydrobromic sulphuric nitric phosphoric maleic acetic salicylic p toluene sulphonic tartaric citric methane sulphonic formic malonic succinic naphthalene 2 sulphonic and benzene sulphonic. Also such salts can be prepared as alkaline metal or alkaline earth salts such as sodium potassium or calcium salts of the carboxylic acid group.

Suitable buffering agents include acetic acid and a salt 1 2 w v citric acid and a salt 1 3 w v boric acid and a salt 0.5 2.5 w v and phosphoric acid and a salt 0.8 2 w v . Suitable preservatives include benzalkonium chloride 0.003 0.03 w v chlorobutanol 0.3 0.9 w v parabens 0.01 0.25 w v and thimerosal 0.004 0.02 w v .

The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention contain an effective amount of a compound of the invention optionally included in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term pharmaceutically acceptable carrier means one or more compatible solid or liquid filler diluents or encapsulating substances which are suitable for administration to a human or other vertebrate animal. The term carrier denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient natural or synthetic with which the active ingredient is combined to facilitate the application. The components of the pharmaceutical compositions also are capable of being commingled with the compounds of the invention and with each other in a manner such that there is no interaction which would substantially impair the desired pharmaceutical efficiency.

The compounds of the invention may be delivered to the brain using a formulation capable of delivering a compound across the blood brain barrier. One obstacle to delivering compounds to the brain is the physiology and structure of the brain. The blood brain barrier is made up of specialized capillaries lined with a single layer of endothelial cells. The region between cells is sealed with a tight junction so the only access to the brain from the blood is through the endothelial cells. The barrier allows only certain substances such as lipophilic molecules through and keeps other harmful compounds and pathogens out. Thus lipophilic carriers are useful for delivering non lipohilic compounds to the brain. For instance DHA a fatty acid naturally occurring in the human brain has been found to be useful for delivering drugs covalently attached thereto to the brain Such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 407 137 . U.S. Pat. No. 5 525 727 describes a dihydropyridine pyridinium salt carrier redox system for the specific and sustained delivery of drug species to the brain. U.S. Pat. No. 5 618 803 describes targeted drug delivery with phosphonate derivatives. U.S. Pat. No. 7 119 074 describes amphiphilic prodrugs of a therapeutic compound conjugated to an PEG oligomer polymer for delivering the compound across the blood brain barrier. The compounds described herein may be modified by covalent attachment to a lipophilic carrier or co formulation with a lipophilic carrier. Others are known to those of skill in the art.

The compounds of the invention may be delivered with other methods for enhancing memory retrieval or treating other symptoms or causes of disorders associated with the memory loss. For instance environmental enrichment EE has been used for enhancing memories. EE involves creating a stimulating environment around a subject. Other therapeutics may also be combined to treat the underlying disorder or to enhance memory.

Morris water maze test. The water maze paradigm is performed in a circular tank diameter 1.8 m filled with opaque water. A platform 11 11 cm is submerged below the water s surface in the center of the target quadrant. The swimming path of the mice is recorded by a video camera and analyzed by the Videomot 2 software TSE . For each training session the mice are placed into the maze consecutively from four random points of the tank. Mice are allowed to search for the platform for 60 s. If the mice do not find the platform within 60 s they are gently guided to it. Mice are allowed to remain on the platform for 15 s. Two training trials are given every day the latency for each trial is recorded for analysis. During the memory test probe test the platform is removed from the tank and the mice are allowed to swim in the maze for 60 s.

Spatial working memory on elevated T maze. Mice are maintained on a restricted feeding schedule at 85 of their free feeding weight. Spatial working memory is first assessed on an elevated plastic T maze. This consists of a start arm 47 10 cm and two identical goal arms 35 10 cm surrounded by a 10 cm high wall. A plastic food well is located 3 cm from the end of each goal arm. The maze is located 1 m above the floor in a well lit laboratory that contained various prominent distal extra maze cues. The mice are habituated to the maze and to drinking sweetened condensed milk over several days before spatial non matching to place testing.

Each trial consists of a sample run and a choice run. On the sample run the mice are forced either left or right by the presence of a plastic block according to a pseudorandom sequence with equal numbers of left and right turns per session and with no more than two consecutive turns in the same direction . A reward consisting of 0.07 ml of sweetened condensed milk diluted 50 50 with water is available in the food well at the end of the arm. The block is then removed and the mouse is placed facing the experimenter at the end of the start arm and allowed a free choice of either arm. The time interval between the sample run and the choice run is approximately 15 s. The animal is rewarded for choosing the previously unvisited arm that is for alternating . Mice are run one trial at a time with an inter trial interval ITI of approximately 10 min. Each daily session consists of 4 trials and mice receive 24 trials in total.

Compounds of the invention are tested for their ability to reinstatement learning behavior through inhibition of HDAC. Brain atrophy occurs during normal aging and is an early feature of neurodegenerative diseases associated with impaired learning and memory. Only recently have mouse models with extensive neurodegeneration in the forebrain been reported. One of these models is the bi transgenic CK p25 Tg mice where expression of p25 a protein implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases Cruz J. et al. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 14 390 394 2004 is under the control of the CamKII promoter and can be switched on or off with a doxycycline diet Fisher A. et al. Neuron 48 471 83 2003 Cruz J. et al. Neuron 40 471 83 2003 . Post natal induction of p25 expression for 6 weeks causes learning impairment that is accompanied by severe synaptic and neuronal loss in the forebrain.

Specifically compounds of the invention are tested for their ability to reinstate learning behavior and to recover access to long term memories in CK p25 Tg mice that had developed synaptic and neuronal loss. p25 is induced in 11 month old CK p25 Tg mice for 6 weeks. Afterwards p25 expression is repressed and one group of CK p25 Tg mice are subjected to daily or intermittent e.g. every other day injection of a compound of the invention for a period of time e.g. 1 4 weeks whereas the other group receives saline injection. Subsequently all mice including a control group that do not express p25 are subjected to fear conditioning and water maze learning. To this end p25 expression is induced in 11 month old CK p25 mice for 6 weeks before one group is injected daily or intermittently e.g. every other day for a period of time e.g. 1 4 weeks with a compound of the invention whereas the control group receives saline. The freezing behavior and spatial learning of vehicle vs. compound treated groups are compared and levels of synaptic marker proteins are measured. Freezing is defined as a lack of movement except for heart beat and respiration associated with a crouching position. Brain atrophy and hippocampal neuronal loss are also evaluated.

The effect of HDAC inhibition using a compound of the invention on the recovery of inaccessible long term memories is evaluated. Eleven month old CK p25 Tg mice are trained in the fear conditioning paradigm and returned to their home cages for 4 weeks. Subsequently p25 is induced for 6 weeks before the mice are injected with either saline vehicle or a compound of the invention for a period of time. Afterwards all mice including a vehicle injected control groups that did not express p25 and a group of compound injected control mice that were not trained are subjected the memory test. The freezing behavior and spatial learning of vehicle vs. compound treated groups are compared and levels of synaptic marker proteins are measured. Brain atrophy and hippocampal neuronal loss are also evaluated. A significant reduction in freezing behavior during the memory test P

Compounds of the invention are tested to determine their effect on plasticity factors in CK p25 Tg mice that developed severe neurodegeneration. p25 is induced in 11 month old CK p25 Tg mice for 6 weeks. Afterwards p25 expression is repressed and one group of CK p25 Tg mice is subjected to daily or intermittent e.g. every other day compound injections for a period of time e.g. 1 4 weeks whereas the other group receives saline injection. Hippocampal neuronal loss is evaluated for compound and vehicle treated mice for example by comparing images showing hippocampal NeuN and MAP 2 staining and using immunoblots from the hippocampus and cortex of all groups.

Compounds of the invention are tested to determine their effect on learning basal anxiety explorative behavior and brain plasticity. C57BL 6J mice are subjected to fear conditioning and are injected intraperitoneally ip with a compound of the invention or saline immediately afterwards. Freezing behavior is evaluated during a memory test performed 24 h later.

C57BL 6J mice are implanted with microcannulae into the lateral brain ventricles icy and are injected with either a compound of the invention or vehicle immediately after fear conditioning. Freezing behavior is evaluated during a memory test performed 24 h later.

C57BL 6J mice are injected ip daily or intermittmently with a compound of the invention or saline for a period of time e.g. 1 4 weeks before all mice are subjected to the elevated plus maze and open field test. MAP 2 immunoreactivity IR in the hippocampus is evaluated and compound treated and vehicle treated mice compared. Markers for brain plasticity are measured.

Compound of the invention are tested to determine their ability to recover spatial memories. CK p25 Tg mice in which p25 expression is repressed and control mice are trained in the water maze paradigm until all mice reliably find the hidden platform. Afterwards all mice are returned to their home cages for 4 weeks to allow the consolidation of hippocampus independent long term memories. Afterwards p25 expression is induced for 6 weeks followed by p25 repression. One group of CK p25 Tg mice are injected daily or intermittently e.g. every other day with a compound of the invention whereas the other group is injected with vehicle.

Pilot studies have shown that a probe test commonly used to analyze memory retrieval in the water maze paradigm is not a reliable read out to analyze long term memory retrieval. In fact without extensive re training even wild type mice show no significant preference for the target quadrant when tested 10 weeks after the training in a probe test. To measure the retrieval of long term memory mice are instead exposed to only 2 reminder training sessions on a single day. The mean escape latency during the reminder training sessions is compared to control mice that did not receive the initial training. Escape latency is evaluated for compound treated and control mice.

Compounds of the invention are tested to determine the specific acetylation mark elicited by the compound which is relevant to the treatment of Rubinstein Taybi. Sagittal brain sections of Rubinstein Taybi CBP mice are immunostained to detect levels of ACH2B in hippocampal neurons. Western blot analysis of hippocampal protein extracts from CBP and WT mice using antibodies against 13 actin H2B nonacetylated ACH2A ACH3 and ACH4 is used to reveal ACH2B level. Quantification of Western blot analysis shows the differences in the level of p actin total H2B ACH2A and ACH3.

Compounds of the invention were evaluated in primary neuronal culture for determining HDAC inhibitor effects in cells. E17 embryonic mouse forebrain was dissociated into a single cell suspension by gentle trituration following trypsin DNAse digestion. Cells were plated at a density of 12 500 cells per well in poly D lysine laminin coated black clear bottom 96 well plates BD Biosciences BD356692 in Neurobasal medium containing 2 B27 and 1 pen strep. Cultures were treated with HDAC inhibitors for 24 h starting on the third day after plating at varying inhibitor concentrations.

Compounds of the invention were evaluated to determine the functional measures of compounds cellular HDAC activity Immunoflourescent analysis . Imaging of neurons was performed using automated microscopy. After 24 h of HDAC inhibitor treatment formaldehyde dissolved in phosphate buffered saline PBS was added directly to the wells for a final concentration of 4 . Cells were fixed for 10 minutes at room temperature. Following two washes with phosphate buffered saline cells were permeabilized and blocked with blocking buffer composed of 0.1 Triton X 100 2 BSA in PBS. For immunofluorescence imaging of histone modifications cells were stained with anti acetyl H3K9 Millipore cat 07 352 or anti Ac H4K12 Millipore cat 04 119 antibodies and Alexa488 conjugated secondary antibody Molecular Probes . Cellular nuclei were identified by staining with Hoechst 33342 Invitrogen H3570 . Cell nuclei and histone acetylation signal intensity were detected and measured using a laser scanning microcytometer Acumen eX3 TTP Laptech . Acumen Explorer software was used to identify a threshold of histone acetylation signal intensity such that in the absence of HDAC inhibitor 99.5 of cells had intensity levels below the threshold. In the presence of HDAC inhibitors cells with histone acetylation signal intensities above the threshold were scored as bright green nuclei . The percentage of nuclei scoring as bright green was quantitated for each HDAC inhibitor. This percentage was then normalized to DMSO controls. Representative images of histone acetylation staining in neurons with dendrites stained by anti Map2B antibody EnCor and Alexa 555 conjugated secondary antibody Molecular Probes shown in red in the absence and presence of HDAC inhibitors were taken on a Zeiss Observer Z1 microscope.

Materials and Methods CBP mutant mice B6.Cg Tg Camk2a Crebbp 1364Tabe J are obtained from for example the Jackson lab. Expression of this FLAG epitope tagged dominant negative truncation of the CREB binding protein FLAG CBPA1 lacking the coding sequence for amino acids 1084 2441 is spatially directed to neurons in the forebrain hippocampus amygdala striatum and cortex and temporally directed to postnatal development by the CaMKIIa promoter. This dominant negative mutant form of CBP designed to interrupt transcription factors utilizing CBP as a co activator for the expression of their target genes is expressed from the transgene at 95 of endogenous CBP levels in the hippocampus and 84 of endogenous CBP levels in the cortex. Hemizygous mice exhibit hippocampus dependent memory deficits such as reduced long term potentiation defective spatial learning and impaired contextual fear conditioning with none of the developmental impairments observed in CBP deficient mutant models. The CBP mutant hemizygous mice and their control littermates are injected daily of intermittently e.g. every other day with vehicle or a compound of the invention for a period of time e.g. 10 days . On day 11 mice are trained in contextual fear conditioning paradigm Training consists of a 3 min exposure of mice to the conditioning box context TSE followed by a foot shock 2 sec 0.8 mA constant current . One hour after training mice are injected with compounds of the invention or vehicle. On day 12 mice are returned to the training box and the freezing behavior were monitored and recorded.

CBP heterozygous mice represent a model of the human disease syndrome of Rubinstien Taybi. It is the same genetic mutation which is believed to be casual in humans. People affected by this syndrome have memory cognition and developmental deficits. Using the dosing paradigm e.g. 1 mg kg QD 10 days compounds of the invention are tested for their ability to restore the memory of these mice to an equivalent level as found in the wildtype littermates.

Materials and Methods CK p25 mouse is an inducible neurodegenerative disease mouse model. The bi transgenic mice are created by crossing the CamK2a tTA and the tetO p25 Tg mouse lines. In the presence of doxycyclin the expression of p25 is suppressed. When doxycyclin is removed the expression of p25 is strongly induced in the forebrain. Six weeks of p25 induction causes massive neuronal loss elevated beta amyloid peptide production tau associated pathology and impairment in learning and memory. For these experiments doxycyclin is removed from 3 month old CK p25 mice and the control littermates for 6 weeks. The mice are subsequently injected with compounds of the invention or vehicle for a period of time e.g. 10 days . After that time period e.g. on day 11 mice are trained in contextual fear conditioning paradigm training consisted of a 3 min exposure of mice to the conditioning box context TSE followed by a foot shock 2 sec 0.8 mA constant current . One hour after training mice are injected with a compound of the invention or vehicle. On day 12 mice are returned to the training box and the freezing behavior is monitored and recorded.

The p25 vehicle group represents non induced vehicle treated mice the p25 CK vehicle group represents the induced untreated mice. The control group consists of the tetO p25 Tg mice fed on normal diet which do not express p25. The compounds of the invention are tested for their ability to restore contextual fear conditioning learning. The brain pathology of p25 is reminiscent of human patients with neurodegeneration and memory impairment.

Mice are trained using contextual fear conditioning paradigm on day 0. For example training consists of a 3 min exposure of mice to the conditioning box context TSE followed by three foot shocks 2 sec 0.8 mA constant current with 15 seconds intervals . From day 1 mice are trained in extinction trials. For each training day mice are twice exposed to the conditioning box for 3 min without foot shock two extinction trials day . One hour after the first trial mice are injected with a compound of the invention e.g. 30 mg l g i.p. . One hour after the injection the second extinction trial is performed. The freezing time in each individual trial is measured.

For the memory reconsolidation paradigm after the fear extinction training as described above mice are re housed in the home cage for one month. Mice are subsequently re expose to the conditioning box for 3 min their freezing behavior is measured. It is well established that after the fear memory extinction trials fear memory will spontaneously recover after resting in the home cage for a period of time. The speculated mechanism for fear extinction is to trigger the formation of new memory which competes with fear memory and in turn reduces the fear response. Conversely reconsolidation based fear memory extinction paradigm has been proposed to directly modify the activated fear memory so that the reduced fear response does not spontaneously recover Extinction reconsolidation boundaries key to per attenuation of fear memories.

Compounds of the invention are tested in several dosing paradigms in terms of frequency and dose in multiple disease states. The experiments above can show treatment is beneficial for extinction of aversive memories. In an embodiment the compounds of the present invention in conjunction with proper training paradigm lead to permanent erasing of fear memory.

Primary cultured mouse forebrain neurons were treated for 24 hours with compounds of the invention and the resulting increases in histone acetylation were measured with immunofluorescence assays. show dose response curves for induction of acetylation of histone H4 lysine 12 and histone H3 lysine 9 for compounds of the invention. Specifically and are dose response curves of histone acetylation ACH4K12 in primary neuronal cultures by compounds of the invention. and are dose response curves of histone acetylation ACH3K9 in primary neuronal cultures by compounds of the invention. For the cultures were treated for 24 hours with compounds of the invention at the indicated doses and histone acetylation was measured in an immunofluorescence assay. The percentage of cells with strong histone acetylation staining bright green cells was quantitated and averaged across duplicate samples from two independent cultures.

The protocol for primary neuronal culture was carried out as follows. E17 embryonic mouse forebrain was dissociated into a single cell suspension by gentle trituration following trypsin DNAse digestion. Cells were plated into poly D lysine laminin coated black clear bottom 96 well plates e.g. BD Biosciences BD356692 6 well plates or 10 cm plates in Neurobasal medium containing 2 B27 and 1 pen strep. Cultures were treated with compounds of the invention for 24 h starting on the thirteenth day after plating at varying concentrations of the compounds of the invention.

The protocol for histone acetylation immunofluorescence assays using primary neuronal culture was carried out as follows. Imaging of neurons was performed using automated microscopy. After 24 h of treatment by compounds of the invention formaldehyde dissolved in phosphate buffered saline PBS was added directly to the wells for a final concentration of 4 . Cells were fixed for 10 minutes at room temperature. Following two washes with phosphate buffered saline cells were permeabilized and blocked with blocking buffer composed of 0.1 Triton X 100 2 BSA in PBS. For immunofluorescence imaging of histone modifications cells were stained with anti acetyl H3K9 e.g. Millipore cat 07 352 or anti Ac H4K12 e.g. Millipore cat 04 119 antibodies and Alexa488 conjugated secondary antibody e.g. Molecular Probes . Cellular nuclei were identified by staining with Hoechst 33342 e.g. Invitrogen H3570 . Cell nuclei and histone acetylation signal intensity were detected and measured using a laser scanning microcytometer e.g. Acumen eX3 TTP Laptech . Acumen Explorer software was used to identify a threshold of histone acetylation signal intensity such that in the absence of compounds of the invention 99.5 of cells had intensity levels below the threshold. In the presence of the compounds of the invention cells with histone acetylation signal intensities above the threshold were scored as bright green nuclei . The percentage of nuclei scoring as bright green was quantitated for compounds of the invention. This percentage was then normalized to DMSO controls.

The protocol was carried out as follows. Large scale primary neuronal cultures were treated with compound 103 at 1 and 10 M for 24 hours and cells were harvested for mass spectrometry analysis of histone acetylation and methylation according to methods developed by S. L. Peach et al. see Quantitative assessment of ChIP grade antibodies directed against histone modifications reveals patterns of co occurring marks on histone protein molecules Molecular Cellular Proteomics published on Mar. 21 2012 as manuscript M111.015941 . is a heat map indicating changes in histone acetylation and methylation states regulated by treatment of primary neuronal cultures with compound 103 of the invention or compound A positive control . Specifically is a heat map indicating the mass spectrometry characterization of histone acetylation and methylation states regulated treatment of neuronal cultures with compounds of the invention. Primary neuronal cultures were treated for 24 hours at the indicated doses. Arrows indicate the histone marks states induced equipotently by control compound A and compound 103.

Changes in many histone marks were induced in a dose dependent manner. However in the case of three specific histone mark states ACH3K27 di or tri MeH3K36 triMeH3K27 triMeH3K36 compound A and compound 103 were equipotent. Thus these three sets of histone marks may represent specific states that respond selectively to inhibition of HDACs 1 2.

E17 embryonic mouse forebrain was dissociated into a single cell suspension by gentle trituration following trypsin DNAse digestion. Cells were plated into poly D lysine laminin coated black clear bottom 96 well plates e.g. BD Biosciences BD356692 6 well plates or 10 cm plates in Neurobasal medium containing 2 B27 and 1 pen strep. Cultures were treated with compounds of the invention for 24 h starting on the thirteenth day after plating at varying concentrations of the compounds of the invention.

Primary neuronal cultures grown in 10 cm plates 3 million cells plate were treated for 24 hours with compound 103 1 M and 10 M . Cells were harvested for proteomic analysis of histone acetylation and methylation states. Nuclei were purified from harvested cells and histones were collected by acid extraction. Mass spectrometric analysis was used to identify the indicated histone acetylation and methylation states Peach S L et al. .

Changes in histone acetylation and methylation are key events in the regulation of gene transcription Bannister A J et al. Cell Res. 21 381 95 . Thus HDAC inhibitors that alter histone mark states in cells also induce changes in gene expression e.g. Chang J et al. Br J Cancer. 2012 Jan. 3 106 1 116 25 . Evidence suggests that HDAC isoforms have unique roles in controlling the expression of neuronal genes some genes appear to be regulated by the coordinated actions of multiple HDACs other genes seem to be uniquely regulated by specific HDACs Guan J S et al. Nature. 2009 May 7 459 7243 55 60 .

Genome wide transcript profile studies were performed to assess the cellular activity of compounds of the invention downstream from their immediate effects on histone acetylation and methylation and to discover gene expression signatures that were specific phenotypes of HDAC1 2 inhibition. For these assays primary cultured neurons were treated with compound A or compound 215 at 10 M for 24 hours and then harvested RNA for transcript profile analysis on Illumina microarrays.

This functionally annotated set consists of 34 genes that were up regulated and 43 genes that were down regulated by compound A and compound 215. These gene expression phenotypes may represent a signature of selective inhibition of HDACs1 2.

The protocol for genome wide transcript profiling assays was carried out as follows. E17 embryonic mouse forebrain was dissociated into a single cell suspension by gentle trituration following trypsin DNAse digestion. Primary neuronal cultures grown in 6 well plates were treated for 24 hours with compound 215 at 10 M. RNA was isolated with the RNeasy kit e.g. Qiagen according to the manufacturer s instructions. cDNA was synthesized using ArrayScript e.g. Ambion . Triplicate samples were collected and analyzed using Illumina mouse whole genome 6 microarrays. Total RNA from the samples was normalized to 20 ng l and the Illumina TotalPrep 96 RNA Amplification Kit e.g. Applied Biosystems PN 4393543 protocol was used for amplification in a semi automated process. The total RNA underwent reverse transcription to synthesize first strand cDNA. This cDNA was then converted into a double stranded DNA template for transcription. In vitro transcription synthesized aRNA and incorporated a biotin conjugated nucleotide. The aRNA was then purified to remove unincorporated NTPs salts enzymes and inorganic phosphate. Labeled cRNA was normalized to 150 ng l and hybridized to Illumina s MouseWG 6 v2.0 Expression BeadChip. The labeled RNA strand was hybridized to the bead on the BeadChip containing the complementary gene specific sequence. After 16 hours of hybridization the beadchips were washed and stained using a Cy3 streptavidin conjugate. Illumina s BeadArray Reader was used to measure the fluorescence intensity at each addressed bead location. Raw data were annotated with Genome Studio Illumina and then quantile normalized and baseline transformed to the median of the DMSO control samples using GeneSpring software Agilent . Probes failing to score as present in 100 of samples from at least one treatment condition were removed. A statistical threshold p

In cells HDACs1 2 are assembled into large multi protein complexes. Three major complexes containing HDACs1 2 have been found to bind to the non selective hydroxamic acid HDAC inhibitor SAHA CoREST NuRD and SIN3 Bantscheff M et al. Nat. Biotechnol. 2011 March 29 3 255 65 .

The ability of compounds of the invention to selectively inhibit HDACs1 2 to effect unique conformational changes in the enzymes induced by assembly into these multi protein complexes which are not achieved by the recombinant free enzymes tested in the in vitro assays was evaluated. HDAC2 complexes from mouse forebrain were immunoprecipitated. The following determinations were made 1 known complex members CoREST mSin3a and Mta3 but not HDAC3 were present in the HDAC2 immunoprecipitates 2 the immunoprecipitated HDAC2 complexes were enzymatically active as confirmed by one of our standard in vitro assays 3 the effects of compound A compound 215 and a negative control compound on this enzymatic activity. shows that both compound A and compound 215 inhibited the enzymatic activity of the HDAC2 immunoprecipitate whereas the negative control compound produced no inhibition indicating that HDAC2 is sensitive to inhibition by compounds of the invention in the context of its endogenous multi protein complexes.

Compound 54 and compound 103 were examined for their efficacy in the model behavior paradigm the contextual fear conditioning task as described in Example 4. It was found that daily injections of either compound 54 or compound 103 10 mg kg daily i.p. enhanced associative learning in wildtype mice see . This experiment was repeated in an inducible mouse model of neurodegeneration the CK p25 mouse see . This mouse model recapitulates many of the hallmarks of Alzheimer s disease e.g. profound neuronal loss in the forebrain increased amyloid peptide production tau hyperphosphorylation and severe cognitive impairment . Following the treatment of CK p25 mice with either compound 54 10 mg kg daily i.p. or compound 103 1 mg kg daily i.p. it was observed that these compounds were able to ameliorate the cognitive deficits compared to vehicle treatment.

After completing the behavioral tests the mice were sacrificed and their brain tissue was subjected to either immunohistochemistry or immunoblotting. Immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that compound 54 administration marginally increased global histone acetylation in the hippocampus see and . In addition compound 103 administration at 1 mg kg substantially decreased immunoreactivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP in the brains of treated animals indicating reduced astrogliosis and inflammation see and .

Specifically the above results directed to acetylation in mouse cortex were obtained by a 2 step Crude Protein Lysis protocol which was adapted from Lysis of Mammalian Cells and Tissue in Gel Loading Buffer from Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual Book 3 Chapter 18 Detection and Analysis of Proteins Expressed from Cloned Genes pages 62 63.

The suspension buffer was prepared using 0.1M NaCl 0.01M TrisCl pH 7.6 and 0.001M EDTA pH 8.0 . The buffer could have be prepared ahead and stored at room temperature. Just before use the following was added 1x phosphatase protease inhibitor cocktail e.g. ThermoFisher HALT cat 78440 and 5 mM Sodium Butyrate HDAC inhibitor .

The 2 SDS gel loading buffer was prepared using 100 mM TrisCl pH 6.8 4 SDS and 20 glycerol. The buffer could have been prepared ahead and stored at room temperature. Just before use the following was added 200 mM dithiothreitol from 1M stock and 5 mM Sodium Butyrate HDAC inhibitor .

Further the Western blots above were obtained as follows. 10 ug cortical extract per sample on BioRad 15 Tris HCl Gel at 150V was resolved for 1 hour. The sample was transfer to PVDF at 350 mA for 1 hour. The membranes were blocked with TBST 5 milk for 1 hour then incubated overnight with primary antibody against i H3K9ac e.g. Millipore 07 352 ii H3 C terminus e.g. Millipore 07 108 iii H4K12ac e.g. Millipore 04 119 or iv Histone H4 H4pan e.g. Millipore 07 108 . The membranes were subsequently incubated with secondary HRP linked antibodies against i Mouse IgG e.g. Cell Signaling 7076 or ii Rabbit IgG e.g. Cell Signaling 7074 for 1 hour. Chemiluminescent signal was generated using Supersignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate ThermoFisher 34076 and radiographic film. Quantification was executed using Image J software e.g. NIH .

The compounds of the invention were tested in various behavioral paradigms. The compounds of the invention were prepared at the beginning of each experiment 10 12 aliquots per experiment in aliquots. All aliquots were frozen and only thawed one time for administration. Each aliquot contained the appropriate concentration of compounds of the invention in 100 DMSO.
