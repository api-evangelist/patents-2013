This invention relates to the art of telecommunication systems and more particularly to the aggregation of mobile terminal location information across multiple network switches via network servers.

Visitor location registers VLRs track mobile terminals currently receiving telecommunications service in a serving coverage area of their respective mobile switches which is different from the home serving area of the mobile terminal subscriber. Real time access to data contained in the VLRs e.g. the mobile terminal s location has the potential to create a new stream of revenue for service providers. Service providers network operations teams and third party marketing departments could use mobile terminal location information aggregated across multiple areas to make important decisions related to network operations e.g. network capacity planning and marketing activities e.g. targeted advertising .

Disadvantageously the ability to quickly identify how many mobile terminals users are in a particular location at a specific time is not the kind of information that is readily available. Also disadvantageously the ability to determine how many mobile terminals users were in a particular location area over a specified period of time is not possible currently. Further disadvantageously contacting all mobile terminals or a specific set of mobile terminals in a specific location via a Short Message Service SMS message is also not possible unless the user of the mobile terminal currently opts into a network application service and continually provides its location to the associated application server which adds more load onto the network as well as drains the mobile terminal s battery.

Apparatuses and methods are provided for a Location Aggregation System. Embodiments are provided that may assist network providers to turn visitor location register location data from telecommunications networks into information that can be aggregated across network switches.

More specifically in one embodiment provided is a method that includes receiving an indication that a location of a mobile terminal has changed in a visitor location register creating from information stored at the visitor location register a record that comprises an identifier of the mobile terminal and an identifier of a new location of the mobile terminal and transmitting the record in a message to a server.

In another embodiment a method is provided that includes receiving a message from a switch via a network connection and populating a database with data from the message wherein the data comprises a record created from information stored at a visitor location register associated with the switch and wherein the record describes a location of a mobile terminal that has changed in the visitor location register.

In another embodiment a server includes a receiver configured to receive a message from a switch via a network connection and a processor connected to the receiver the processor being configured to populate a database with data from the message wherein the data comprises a record created from information stored at a visitor location register associated with the switch and wherein the record describes a location of a mobile terminal that has changed in the visitor location register.

Embodiments are provided that address how to turn visitor location register VLR location data from telecommunications networks into information that can be aggregated across network switches accessed by a direct query mechanism or via application programming interfaces and reported upon from a single point of entry with minimal impact to the performance or capacity of the network switches.

In one embodiment LAS is an application server that houses all of the functionality for aggregating mobile terminal location information contained in multiple VLRs over time and over multiple networks. LAS will maintain the location of all mobile terminals through new service logic produced during standard mobility management procedures. After aggregating the mobile terminal location information LAS is configured to store the information in Location Aggregation Database . A more detailed explanation of the functions of LAS and Location Aggregation Database is provided in the illustrative embodiments herein below. Although only one Location Aggregation System is shown in there may be multiple Location Aggregation Systems which connect to a plurality of switches which connect to a plurality of radio access networks. is shown as representative of a portion of a telecommunications network in order to simplify the description of the present invention while still presenting the subject matter so that it may be completely understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.

Switches perform communication session set up and tear down and convey calls or messages between a plurality of endpoints e.g. calls from mobile devices to other mobile devices . Switches may have call control components not shown that monitor all mobile terminal i.e. a mobile or handheld device that incorporates wireless voice communication capability as a standard function calls within their serving area arranges handoffs between switches keeps track of billing information etc. In one embodiment switches may comprise a mobile switching center e.g. MSC MSC and MSC that serves a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS network e.g. location area code LAC LAC and LAC . In another embodiment switches may comprise a Mobility Management Entity e.g. MME and MME that serves a Long Term Evolution LTE Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network E UTRAN network e.g. LAC and LAC . In yet another embodiment not shown switches may comprise Serving General Packet Radio Service Support Nodes that serve a Global System for Mobile Communications GSM network. The functions of telecommunication switches are well known in the art and will not be described in detail.

Each of switches are associated with their own VLR i.e. VLRs to collectively hereinafter referred to as VLRs . In one illustrative embodiment each of switches is integrated with their own VLR e.g. switches are integrated with VLR and switches are integrated with VLR etc . In another embodiment not shown the VLR may be very tightly linked with the switch via a proprietary interface. VLRs are databases that contain information about the subscribers roaming within a location area of switches . Whenever a mobile terminal enters an area served by VLRs and registers there VLRs inform the subscriber s home location register HLR not shown of the change in the mobile terminal s location. The HLR downloads the service profile i.e. a record of the subscriber name telephone number address account status and telephone features subscribed to of the roaming subscriber as well as other information necessary for call termination at the mobile terminal to VLRs . VLRs monitor the mobile terminal s location while the mobile terminal is within the coverage area of VLRs . Illustratively VLR monitors a mobile terminal s location while the mobile terminal is within LAC and VLR monitors a mobile terminal s location while the mobile terminal is within LAC . A subscriber mobile terminal cannot be present in more than one VLR at a time.

Also each of switches are connected to one or more radio transmitters receivers and controllers i.e. radio transmitters receivers to collectively hereinafter referred to as radio transmitters receivers that provide bi directional wireless connectivity for wireless communication devices e.g. pocket mobile phones mobile telephones installed in an engine driven vehicle smart phones personal digital assistance PDA devices a digital video camera that can access the Internet two way pagers notebook computers wireless portable media players that allow an addition of executable programs or other portable devices with the capability to connect and interact with a wireless network within a geographical area or a cell. A cell is a basic geographic unit of a cellular system and radio transmitters receivers may be positioned at or near the center of a cell in one of LAC through LAC . Illustratively radio transmitters receivers are centrally situated within a cell of LAC and radio transmitters receivers are centrally situated within a cell of LAC . Architecture may include a much larger number of cells in actual practice but a small number of cells is depicted in for the sake of simplicity. In one illustrative embodiment radio transmitters receivers comprise base stations in a UMTS network e.g. radio transmitters receivers radio transmitters receivers and radio transmitters receivers . In another illustrative embodiment radio transmitters receivers comprise access network edge devices in a LTE network e.g. radio transmitters receivers and radio transmitters receivers .

Radio transmitters receivers comprise a radio access network and switches comprise a core network. The connections i.e. links to collectively hereinafter referred to as links between radio transmitters receivers and switches may encompass optical links wireless links packet switched channels direct communication channels microwave Ethernet or any combination thereof depending on the needed capacity and expense.

For purposes of illustration and example every time a mobile terminal s location is changed in VLRs e.g. a movement of the mobile terminal denoted by a change in the cell identity cell ID or Service Area Code identity SAC ID in UMTS and a change in the E utran Cell Global Identifier E CGI in LTE switches may be configured to execute new service logic to generate a message that contains a Location Change Record LOC CHG Record . The LOC CHG Record is created from mobile terminal location data stored in VLRs and includes an identifier of the mobile terminal and an identifier of the new location of the mobile terminal. Illustratively MSC may have one or more processors not shown that execute program logic to generate a message that contains the LOC CHG Record every time the mobile terminal s location is changed in VLR as a result of MSC receiving an indicator such as a Mobile Origination message a Mobile Termination message a Page Response a Location Services Query a Location Update message or a Call Independent Supplementary Service CISS procedure. Also illustratively MME may have one or more processors not shown that execute program logic to generate a message that contains the LOC CHG Record every time the mobile terminal s location is changed in VLR as a result of MME receiving an indicator such as a Mobile Attach Detach message a Mobile Origination message a Mobile Termination message a Tracking Area Update message a Page Response or a SMS origination termination message. In another illustrative embodiment VLRs may package the information that comprises the LOC CHG Records into a proprietary message to be sent to LAS when VLRs is updated for a mobile terminal with a new location.

The frequency in which the message that contains the LOC CHG Records is sent to LAS may be a parameter that is adjustable by a service provider. In one illustrative embodiment after creating the LOC CHG Record switches may be configured to send one or more LOC CHG Records associated with the location change of one or more mobile terminals to LAS in real time i.e. immediately . In another illustrative embodiment switches may be configured to send the one or more LOC CHG Records to LAS in a batch process i.e. in predetermined intervals such as every 15 minutes as provisioned by a service provider. This predetermined interval or waiting time provides switches with more time to aggregate records of other mobile terminals that have a location change in VLRs . Switches may be configured to send the one or more LOC CHG Records in one or more messages to LAS via a network connection e.g. an Internet Protocol IP connection . The physical medium i.e. links that connects switches to LAS may comprise landline or wireless physical media.

According to the illustrative embodiment LAS will have interfaces for receiving and sending messages. In one embodiment LAS may be configured to receive the one or more messages from switches over the network connection. After receiving the one or more messages LAS may have one or more processors configured to extract the one or more LOC CHG Records from the one or more messages and populate Location Aggregation Database with data from the one or more LOC CHG Records.

In another embodiment LAS may have one or more processors configured to generate query messages to be sent to switches over the network connection. LAS may send periodic query messages to switches to verify a location of mobile terminals for which a change in location has not been received in a long time i.e. the location information is stale . These periodic query messages allow LAS to determine whether a the mobile terminal is being stationary in the same place for a long time as the stale LOC CHG Record indicates or b the mobile terminal has moved to a different location and LAS did not receive a current LOC CHG Record. When the response to the periodic query message indicates that the mobile terminal is in the same place as the stale LOC CHG Record indicates then LAS may refrain from querying that mobile terminal so often because there is a high probability that the mobile terminal is stationary and will not be moving soon. So LAS may delay the frequency of the next periodic Location Update so that it is not querying a stationary mobile so often to prevent excess location queries in the network.

LAS may be preferably embodied in one or more server apparatus but may reside in one or more computing apparatus such as one or more mainframe computers or one or more soft switches or one or more processors or any combination of processors or computers configured to perform the functions described. In the exemplary embodiment software running on LAS facilitates the overall functionality of LAS as well as the described functions.

Location Aggregation Database may be configured to receive data from LAS via link store the data and manage identifiers of mobile terminals and their associated location data. Illustratively Location Aggregation Database may be configured to store the following categories of data that may be contained in the LOC CHG Records a an identifier of the mobile terminal associated with each LOC CHG Record b multiple identifiers for the new location c a time stamp of when the mobile terminal location change occurred d an access technology associated with the new location and e an Activity type that indicates how the data was obtained.

According to the illustrative embodiment the data stored in Location Aggregation Database may be updated every time a mobile terminal s location is changed in VLRs and LAS receives a new LOC CHG Record from one or more of switches . Location Aggregation Database may have a LOC SAC Count Table that keeps count of the number of each device type in every location. When LAS processes LOC CHG Records counts in the LOC SAC Count Table may be incremented or decremented as mobile terminals move into or out of a specific location. Also counts may be kept based on periodic sampling e.g. every minute during a collection interval e.g. every 15 minutes that can be used to count average and peak number of mobile terminals in a collection interval.

Also a snapshot of the LOC SAC Count Table may be written to Location Measurement files on a collection interval basis e.g. every 15 minutes . Location Measurement counts may include the current number of mobile terminals the peak number of mobile terminals during the interval and an average number of mobile terminals during the interval. These Location Measurement files may then be collected over time and loaded into tools that can provide a statistical history trend for the specified location over time. This historical information may be used by service providers for network capacity planning or sold for marketing purposes.

Location Aggregation Database may be organized so that when information identifying a particular request is presented the corresponding set of records may be retrieved. Illustratively Location Aggregation Database may be organized so that it may retrieve location specific records of the number of smart phones in a particular cell at a specific time or date for real time targeted advertising. Also illustratively Location Aggregation Database may be organized so that it may retrieve location specific records of the number of mobile terminals in an area based on a brand name of each mobile terminal. Further illustratively Location Aggregation Database may be organized so that it may retrieve location specific records of the number of mobile terminals in an area that are users of UMTS and LTE for a service provider s network capacity planning purposes.

In the exemplary embodiment Location Aggregation Database is shown as a database external to LAS that may be stored local to LAS or remote therefrom. In another embodiment Location Aggregation Database may be integrated within LAS . Location Aggregation Database may be available anytime LAS is up and running as they are interdependent. Location Aggregation Database may be embodied as an object oriented database or any other format that may be suitable for the necessary information retrieval such as a relational database.

Service providers may be able to utilize Network Location Aggregation Management Console to search Location Aggregation Database display mobile terminal location information contained in Location Aggregation Database on a map or aggregate the mobile terminal location data into meaningful statistics e.g. statistics that depict a status or state of a service provider s network . Also third parties may be able to access Location Aggregation Database via an application programming interface to search the stored information in Location Aggregation Database .

System Initialization Module which defines all system parameters and configuration data required to operate LAS . Such data might include but is not limited to 1. Frequency of Periodic Location Updates if the mobile terminal location is stale e.g. 15 30 45 60 minute increments 2. Delay Factor for Periodic Location Update generation e.g. 15 30 45 60 minute increments 3. Maximum Threshold for Periodic Location generation e.g. 60 120 180 minute increments 4. Maximum Location Aggregation Database Size Threshold 5. Desired Location Aggregation DB Size used when deleting records when Location Aggregation Database size reaches the maximum size. and 6. The list of network elements e.g. MSCs MMEs allowed to send location data to LAS .

Populate Location Aggregation Database Module which supports 1 populating Location Aggregation Database with a LOC CHG Record as it is received from switches and 2 updating the LOC SAC Count Table in Location Aggregation Database for the LOC SAC SAC Range Cell E utran Cell ID ECI .

Periodic Query for Location Information Module which supports periodic query messages sent to switches to update a mobile terminal s location area when LAS has not received a recent LOC CHG Record. The frequency of the periodic query messages is provisionable by a service provider e.g. in 15 30 45 60 minute increments . If the periodic query messages do not result in LAS receiving a new LOC CHG Record for the mobile terminal subscriber LAS will delay the frequency of the next periodic Location Update by some delay factor until the maximum Periodic Location Generation Threshold is reached. This delay factor prevents excess location queries in the network if the mobile terminal is resident in the same LOC SAC for an extended period of time.

Create Historical LOC SAC Count Tables Module which includes supporting the taking of a snapshot of the LOC SAC Count Table every 15 minutes and a new Historical LOC SAC Count Table is created that can be used for querying location information over a range of time dates.

Real Time Location Info Queries Module which supports a query mechanism against Location Aggregation Database . Query options against the LOC SAC Count Table may include a The number of mobile terminals in a SAC or a range of SACs for the latest reporting window b The number of mobile terminals in a LAC or a range of LACs for the latest reporting window and c The number of mobile terminals currently being served by a particular radio network controller base station controller MME. Query options against the LOC CHG Table might include a Location of a specific mobile b List of all mobile subscribers in a particular SAC and c List of all subscriber numbers in a particular LAC who are using a specific type of smart phone.

Historical Location Info Queries Reports Module supports location information queries and report creation using the Historical LOC SAC Count Table data from Location Aggregation System Database . Examples of historical type queries reports that may be supported include a The number of mobile terminals in a certain SAC or range of SACs over a time date range b The number of mobile terminals in a certain LAC or range of LACs over a time date range c A map of the number of mobile terminals to a geographical map by cell site coordinates in a particular time date range d Query on mobile terminal demographics e.g. Smart Phone vs. Basic Cell Phone etc. for a SAC LAC or range of SACs LACs over a time period and e The length of time mobile terminals are spending in a SAC LAC.

Network and Marketing Analysis Module which assists a service provider or a marketing department in the use of the historical location data collected in Location Aggregation Database i.e. Historical LOC SAC Count Table to make decisions related to network operations or target marketing. Illustrative analyses 1. Based on historical usage e.g. the number of mobile terminals in a SAC LAC or range of SACs LACs combined with the number of smart phones in those areas would it be beneficial to add a Wireless Fidelity Wi Fi based on IEEE 802.11 hot spot in the area to offload some traffic from the radio network 2. Based on historical usage e.g. the number of mobile terminals in SAC LAC or range of SACs LACs combined with the time of day and length of stay would it make sense for the service provider to open a retail store in that area 

Maintenance Modules which keep LAS in perfect harmony with the location data that resides in VLRs . In addition there are provisions to rebuild Location Aggregation Database if the system experiences a hardware failure a duplex failure a system initialization or any catastrophic event.

Audit Location Aggregation Data Module which supports an audit of Location Aggregation Database . The audit module ensures that data is current and accurate between VLRs and Location Aggregation Database .

Purge Old Location Aggregation Database Records Module which supports a purge of out dated LOC CHG Records and Historical LOC SAC Count Table records so as not to cause overload conditions on LAS . Illustratively when the size of Location Aggregation Database reaches the maximum size Location Aggregation Database threshold the oldest LOC CHG records and Historical LOC SAC Count Table records are deleted until a desired size of Location Aggregation Database is reached. The Historical LOC SAC Count Table records may be offloaded to files if a longer history needs to be maintained than what can be stored in Location Aggregation Database .

Reset Location Aggregation Database Module which supports a rebuild of Location Aggregation Database in the event of a loss of data in LAS due to a hardware failure a duplex failure a system initialization or any other catastrophic event that could potentially cause the loss of data in LAS . Illustratively LAS may send a RESET command e.g. similar to a HLR Reset to each of VLRs that currently feeds LAS . Upon receipt of the RESET command from LAS each of VLRs that currently feeds LAS creates a LOC CHG Record to send to LAS on the next activity for each mobile terminal regardless of whether the location information has changed since last reporting.

Billing Module which produces a billing record called a Location Query Billing Record which may be used to bill an initiator of any location query messages against Location Aggregation Database . The Location Query Billing Record is a billing record that documents who requested what information from LAS and when it was requested.

Processor is configured to receive and process instructions and to perform functions necessary for LAS to obtain and manage the LOC CHG Records. Specifically Processor may execute program logic to a extract LOC CHG Records from messages received from switches b populate Location Aggregation Database with the LOC CHG Records c increment decrement the LOC SAC Table located in Location Aggregation Database d generate periodic real time query messages to switches to request current LOC CHG Records of mobile terminals e generate messages to instruct switches NLRs to create a LOC CHG Record that switches may send to LAS on a next activity for each mobile terminal when data is loss etc.

Processor may be any type of processor capable of manipulating data and performing the functions described herein for LAS . Processor should not be construed to refer exclusively to hardware capable of executing software and may implicitly include without limitation digital signal processor DSP hardware application specific integrated circuit ASIC field programmable gate array FPGA read only memory ROM for storing software random access memory RAM for storing software and non volatile storage. The functions of Processor may be provided by a single dedicated processor by a single shared processor or by a plurality of individual processors some of which may be shared.

Memory may contain memory locations for storing information for Processor and the instructions e.g. aggregate LOC CHG Records from the received messages populate Location Aggregation Database with the LOC CHG Records executed by Processor including the software modules that facilitate the overall functionality of LAS . Processor reads information and instructions from Memory and writes information to Memory .

Memory may be any type of component capable of storing information. Memory may be embodied as random access memory RAM read only memory ROM magnetic disk drive storage media optical storage media flash memory drives on board memory included within Processor Erasable Programmable ROM EPROM Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM EEPROM registers or any combination thereof.

Transmitter Receiver are devices that may be used to access particular types of network elements e.g. switches with which LAS wishes to communicate. Illustratively Transmitter Receiver receives LOC CHG Records from switches and forwards them to Processor via bus . Also illustratively Transmitter Receiver sends query messages generated by Processor to switches . Transmitter Receiver may be implemented as a transceiver. An antenna not shown may be electronically coupled to Transmitter Receiver .

A bus is used for the exchange of information between Memory and Processor . Also a bus is used for the exchange of information between Transmitter Receiver and Processor . Although only bus and bus are shown there may be multiple buses which may include a control signal bus a data bus a power bus etc. The various buses are illustrated as bus and bus in order to simplify the description of the invention.

Advantageously the methods according to the invention enable service providers to perform real time analyses with mobile terminal location information. Also advantageously harvesting and storing mobile terminal location information from across multiple switches may allow service providers to learn the demographics of their mobile subscriber population down to a very specific location area. Further advantageously providing service providers with management tools to search display on a map or roll up this data into meaningful statistics is key to enabling service providers to offer the real time location data to third parties thus creating a new revenue stream. Further still advantageously the Location Aggregation System will maintain the location of all mobile terminals through location change records produced during standard mobility management procedures and provide the means to target SMS delivery to any or all mobile terminals in a specified location.

In step switches receive an indication that a location of a mobile terminal has changed in VLRs . The indication may be a Mobile Origination message a Mobile Termination message a Mobile Attach Detach message a Location Update message a Tracking Area Update message a Page Response a SMS message a LCS Query a CISS procedure etc.
