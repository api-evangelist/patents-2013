title: Synthetic stereoisomer peptides in the retro-inverso and inverso configuration, and with cyclic and linear structure, their polymer conjugates, their encapsulation in polymer particles, and uses thereof
abstract: This invention discloses ligand-targeted multi-stereoisomer peptide-polymer conjugate compounds comprising a plurality of different synthetic and chemically modified stereoisomer peptides that have been conjugated to a biocompatible polymer carrying a peptide ligand for targeted delivery or encapsulated in ligand targeted polymer nanoparticles. The unique physicochemical properties of the stereoisomer peptides provide therapeutic compounds with ideal biopharmaceutical properties. The stereoisomer peptides carried by the polymer are delivered to cells or tissues to inhibit, suppress, block, or disrupt, simultaneously and independently, the functional domain of a different disease causing protein. Therefore the compounds are useful therapeutics for the treatment of abnormal angiogenesis and inflammation which are the hall mark of most human diseases including but not limited to cancer, metastasis, pathological conditions of the eye, cardiovascular, brain, and neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, and diseases caused by infectious microorganisms.

This invention relates to therapeutic compounds comprising a plurality of different synthetic and chemically modified stereoisomer peptides in retro inverso and inverso configuration and with linear or cyclic constrained structure that are conjugated to a polymer carrying a peptide ligand or encapsulated in ligand targeted polymer nanoparticles to create novel and unique ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds and uses thereof for the treatment of a plurality of mammalian diseases induced by abnormal angiogenesis and inflammation caused by the abnormal activation of a variety of proteins in the body or proteins from infectious microorganisms.

Incorporated by reference herein in its entirety is the Sequence Listing entitled Sequence Listing ST25.txt. 

The following description provides a summary of information relevant to present disclosure and is not a concession that any of the information provided or publications referenced herein is prior art to the presently claimed invention.

Angiogenesis is the growth of new blood vessels from existing ones and it is an important biological process for tissue development growth and repair. Angiogenesis is also an integral component of many physiological and pathological conditions such as wound healing inflammation and tumor growth Folkman J. and Klagsbrun M. 1987. Science 235 442 447 . Under abnormal conditions angiogenesis can either directly or indirectly cause a particular disease that may include cancer solid tumors metastasis diabetes inflammation cardiovascular disease rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis inflammatory diseases and Alzheimer s and Parkinson s diseases and related neurological disease conditions brain disorders neurodegenerative disorders neuropsychiatric illnesses bipolar disorder and diseases caused by aging. Angiogenesis may also exacerbate an existing pathological condition leading to other diseases including eye retinopathies such as wet age related macular degeneration choroidal neovascularization diabetic retinopathy diabetic macular edema retinal vein occlusion and retinal angiomatus. These angiogenesis dependent diseases are the result of new blood vessels growing excessively. In these conditions new blood vessels feed diseased tissues and destroy normal tissues and in the case of cancer the new vessels allow tumor cells to grow and establish solid tumors or to escape into the circulation and lodge in other organs leading to tumor metastases.

There is considerable evidence showing that angiogenesis and chronic inflammation are closely related the nature of this link involves both a considerable increase of cellular infiltration and proliferation and the intervention of many growth factors and cytokines with overlapping activities Jackson J R et al. 1997 FASEB J 11 457 465 . Thus targeting abnormal angiogenesis is important for the treatment of inflammation which is at the root of all chronic illnesses including but not limited to cancer eye pathologies diabetes obesity arthrosclerosis reumathoid arthritis heart metabolic skin and brain diseases disorders Alzheimer s Parkinson s Crohn s pulmonary and bowel disease dementia depression bipolar disorders autism to name a few. Inflammation therefore is a complex biological response of the vascular tissues angiogenesis to harmful stimuli such as cell damage infections by pathogens physical injuries toxicants irritants foreign debris burns stress and trauma.

Inflammation is a process by which the body s white blood cells and chemicals protect the body from infection and foreign substances such as bacteria and viruses. Inflammation can be acute or chronic. Acute inflammation is the initial response of the body to harmful stimuli and involves the vascular system the immune system the movement of blood cells and local cells into the injured tissues along with a cascade of biological events. When inflammation persists becomes chronic. There is stimulation of pro inflammatory immune cells when they are not needed causing progressive damage to the cells and tissues e.g. pancreatic tissues gut mucosa blood vessel lining and joint tissue to name a few at the site of inflammation leading to a variety of diseases.

Many pro angiogenic factors are mediators of inflammation Campa et al. 2010 ID 546826 1 14 and in some diseases the body s immune system inappropriately triggers an inflammatory response when there are no foreign substances to fight off in these autoimmune diseases the body s normally protective immune system causes damage to its own tissues. Multiple sclerosis type 1 diabetes mellitus thyroiditis rheumatoid arthritis and lupus are autoimmune diseases. Thus it is reasonable to deduce that most human diseases are inflammatory and that this is mainly due to abnormal angiogenesis defined as the uncontrolled growth of new blood vessels induced by the abnormal balance of many proteins involved in different cellular signaling pathways and biochemical functions in the body.

Numerous studies have demonstrated the direct association of abnormal angiogenesis chronic inflammation and many human diseases. For example inflammation triggered by microbes is a protective response against pathogens however it causes secondary damage to host tissues i.e. DNA damage in various cell types resulting in carcinogenesis. Such inflammatory response induced by chronic infections with pathogens trigger liver colorectal and cervical cancers and lymphoma Kipanyula M J. et al. 2012. Cell Signal October 30. doi pii 50898 6568 12 00294 X. 10.1016 j.cellsig.2012.10.014 . Therefore chronic inflammation is a high risk for many cancers including pancreatic cancer. For example proteins such as nitric oxide synthase iNOS and cyclooxygenase 2 COX 2 are over expressed in pancreatic cancer tissues hyperlipidemia obesity and type II diabetes are also associated with chronic inflammation in the pancreas and involved in pancreatic cancer development Takahashi M et al. 2012. Semin Immunopathol. September 7 Epub ahead of print . It is clear from the examples that abnormal angiogenesis and inflammation play important roles in the pathogenesis of diseases.

Diseases of the eye are also closely related to angiogenesis and inflammation. Although there is not known lymphatic system in the eye evidence from research studies have shown that the eye and their different surrounding tissues also have several lymphatic channels. Thus both lymphangiogenesis and inflammation play important roles in pathological conditions in the eye including corneal transplant rejection ocular tumor progression macular edema macular degeneration choroidal neovascularization among other abnormal conditions Nakao S. et al. 2012 J. Ophthalmology. Article ID 783163 11 pages doi 10.1155 2012 783163 .

The central nervous system CNS tissues including the brain the eye and the spinal cord are protected from the circulation by a complex of biological barriers and covered with a myeloid cell population known as microglia. When the CNS is damaged by acute insults neurodegenerative conditions and psychiatric disorders there is an impairment of mechanisms such as neurogenesis and angiogenesis. This vascular dysfunction leads to cerebrovascular disorders which cause neuropathological changes in the brain leading for example to dementia e.g. Alzheimer s disease . Thus cerebrovascular disease and microvascular alterations seem to interact with the underlying brain pathology affecting the progression of cognitive deficits and encompassing changes in virtually all cell types of the neurovascular unit including endothelial cells vascular smooth muscle cells pericytes and astrocytes Pimentel Coelho P M and Rivest S. 2012. Eur J. Neurosci. 35 12 1917 37 Grammas P. et al 2011. Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 15 4 6 616 27 .

Growth factors are capable of stimulating cellular growth proliferation and cellular differentiation and are involved in most cancers. They are important for regulating a variety of cellular processes and act as signaling molecules between cells Welsh et al. Amer. J. Surg. 194 2007 S76 S83 . Excessive angiogenesis occurs when diseased cells produce abnormal amounts of growth factors or pro angiogenic factors overwhelming the effects of natural angiogenesis inhibitors. Pro angiogenic growth factors include vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF A B and C fibroblast growth factor bFGF platelet derived growth factor PDGF a b epidermal growth factor EGF proepithelin PEPI or PC cell derived growth factor PCDGF among many others Marjon P L et al. Molecular Cancer 2004 3 1 12 Kwabi Addo B et al. Endocr Relat Cancer. 2004 11 4 709 24 .

Cancer is caused by over expression and up regulation of proteins i.e. growth factors implicated in many physiological pathways and endocrine functions as well as the dysfunction of proteins that suppress cancer i.e. p53 by interacting with other proteins i.e. MDM2 . When these cellular proteins become disfunctional abnormal cells divide without control and migrate and spread to any tissue through the blood and lymph systems Hanahan D Weinberg R A. 2000 Cell 100 1 57 70 causing cancer. The most common cancers include breast colon pancreas prostate blood bladder brain blood bone kidney lung liver skin ovarian thyroid gastrointestinal head and neck and neural among others Jemal et al. CA Cancer J. Clin. 2008 58 2 71 96 . Progress in cancer research has been slow since the drugs are mainly palliative and do not cure cancer hence there is a persisting need to develop effective therapeutic compounds that are more stable more potent with minimum or no toxicity and that prolong the life of patients while providing significant improvement in their quality of life QOL .

Pathological conditions of the eye include age related macular degeneration choroidal neovascularization AMD proliferative diabetic retinopathy PDR diabetic macular edema DME among others. These diseases are the result of aberrant proliferation of new blood microvessels or neoangiogenesis Hubschman et al. Clinical Ophthalmology 2009 3 167 174 . VEGF is a major factor in neovascular eye diseases and is the target of several anti VEGF therapies based on monoclonal antibodies. Unfortunately such therapies induce considerably side effects thus effective therapies are an unmet medical need.

Receptors found in the extra cellular matrix are transmembrane proteins that bind ligands. Integrins are receptors for a variety of extra cellular matrix proteins mediating migration of endothelial cells and regulating their growth survival and differentiation but there are also present on tumor cells of various origins Cox et al Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2010 9 10 804 20 . Receptors involved in human diseases include but are not limited to VEGF receptors G protein receptors ERBB receptors platelet derived growth factor receptor PDGFR CXR1 CXR2 CCR3 CCR5 receptors and NOGO receptors. Neurodegenerative diseases and mood disorders are example of diseases caused by the unbalanced neurotransmission of receptors and structural impairment of neuroplasticity. Chronic stress causes decrease of neurotrophin levels inducing depression. Antidepressants like lithium help increase expression of neurotrophins like BDNF and VEGF thereby blocking or reversing structural and functional pathologies via neurogenesis. Lithium also induces mood stabilization and neurogenesis due to the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta GSK 3beta which allows the accumulation of beta catenin. Increased levels of GSK 3beta and beta catenin are associated with various neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases Wada A. J Pharmacol Sci 2009 110 14 28 . Thus inhibition of GSK 3 beta expression seems therefore beneficial to ameliorate and or stabilize mood disorders and induce neurogenesis.

The unbalanced presence of receptors also causes neurodegeneration. The Nogo receptor binds to the myelin associated proteins Nogo A MAG and OMgp causing neurodegeneration. It can inhibit differentiation migration and neurite outgrowth of neurons causing poor recovery of the adult central nervous system CNS from damage. Brain derived neurotrophic factor stimulates the phosphorylation suppressing Nogo dependent inhibition of neurite outgrowth from neuroblastoma derived neural cells thus it is important to control Nogo signaling to prevent neuronal damage.

Some proteins in the human body when suppressed exert a positive or beneficial effect. The target of rapamycin mTOR when inhibited suppresses the overexpression of HER2 oncoprotein which is involved in cancer or inhibits the process of aging by extending the lifespan of organisms e.g. worms fruit fly yeast and mice mTOR is therefore a suitable target to create potential anti cancer and anti aging compounds Liu et al. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 2009 8 627 644 . Other negative regulators of angiogenesis include thrombospondin 1 brain derived antiangiogenesis inhibitor tumnstatin angiostatin somatostatin tropomyosin and endostatin among others. These proteins inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis in vivo.

Diseases caused by pathogen agents include those acquired by blood borne pathogens like viruses e.g. HIV HCV HBV HSV HTLV among others through blood via infected people or animals blood transfusions or sexual contact. HIV AIDS is a worldwide disease of large proportions Richman et al. Science 2009 323 1304 1307 yet there is no cure in spite of nearly four decades of basic and vaccine research.

Diseases caused by infectious agents include those caused by prions which induce their own replication and derive from self those caused by parasites e.g. malaria TB acquired through bites by host organisms e.g. insects rodents and those caused by pathogens acquired by contaminated food or water or open wounds e.g. bacteria fungi yeast .

Prions contain a protein PrP 27 30 which aggregates forming amyloid plaques that accumulate selectively in the central nervous system cells causing neurodegenerative diseases such as Creuzfeldt Jakob and Alzheimer s diseases Down s syndrome fatal familial insomnia and Parkinson s Disease. Prions are transmitted through contaminated plasma products meat and feeds or by person to person Gu et al. JBC 2002 277 3 2275 228 . There are no drugs to treat prion infection hence the need to develop novel drugs for this disease.

Bacterial and parasitic infections are a worldwide health problem. MRSA is a highly infectious bacteria and the cause of worldwide nosocomial infections. Kaufmann et al. Exper. Opin. Biol. Ther. 2008 8 6 719 724 . Tuberculosis caused by the pathogenic bacteria Mtb is presently the leading cause of death from infectious disease infecting more than a third of the world s population Ciulli et al. Chem Bio Chem 2008 9 2606 2611 . It is acquired from small infected mammals or by person to person. other highly infectious and deadly bacteria spreads by drinking contaminated water Townes et al. Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 2009 387 500 503 . Malaria caused by the protozoan is spread by mosquito bites infecting the red blood cells VanBuskirk et al. PNAS 2009 106 31 13004 13009 .

The diseases described above are the result of the abnormal balance of many proteins involved in different functions and physiological pathways in the body. Thus it is clear that many different signaling proteins and biochemical pathways are involved in abnormal angiogenesis and chronic inflammation and many proteins that are abnormally over expressed or down regulated trigger such abnormal angiogenesis and inflammation. Drugs approved to treat many of these diseases are single target drugs that provide a modest and transient clinical effect but do not cure the aimed disease and most are non specific. Furthermore clinical trials of drugs targeting many of these diseases have shown numerous times that targeting a single protein or an angiogenesis pathway or a single mechanism or a single disease condition is unlikely to result in the best possible benefit for the patient clinical trials with combination therapies for cancer i.e. chemo radiation and antibodies or HIV HAART to name a few have proven unsuccessful since none of these approaches cure either cancer or HIV infection. Therefore there is an urgent and persisting need to develop novel and unique multi targeted therapies.

It would be therefore advantageous to create therapeutic compounds carrying a plurality of different synthetic stereoisomer peptides in their retro inverso or inverso and linear and cyclic configuration for the purpose of simultaneously and independently targeting different pathologic proteins involved in a disease. This approach may allow simultaneous interference at different levels in the biochemical cascade or interference of different cellular pathways that lead to disease when proteins are abnormally over expressed or down regulated. For example targeting simultaneously several proteins involved in abnormal angiogenesis and inflammation would enable therapeutic applications for cancer eye pathologies brain diseases neurological diseases diabetes cardiovascular diseases arthritis infectious diseases psoriasis Alzheimer s and Parkinson s diseases diabetes bipolar disorders among many others.

Accordingly there is need to create novel and unique compounds by searching finding integrating converging modifying and applying existing knowledge and technologies. This invention precisely follows such approach to create for the first time novel and unique ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds that can be used as therapeutics for the treatment of a variety of human diseases. The particular medical application of a therapeutic compound created in this invention will depend on the plurality of specific and unique stereoisomer peptides comprised in the polymer conjugate.

A variety of methods described in the literature to synthesize peptides are aimed at improving modifying or providing alternative approaches for their synthesis and for the terminal groups protection and coupling that can be applied depending on the structure of the peptide to be synthesized and the conformation. Such peptide synthesis methods are well known to those of skill in the art see Stewart J M and Young J D 1984 Solid phase peptide synthesis 2nd ed. . Rockford Pierce Chemical Company Atherton E and Sheppard R C 1989 Solid Phase peptide synthesis a practical approach. Oxford England IRL Press and Henklein et al 2008 J. Peptide Science 14 8 P10401 104 Greene s Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis 4th ed. John Wiley Sons Inc. 2007 . Methods for synthesizing retroinverso peptides which are similar to their L counterparts may also vary depending on the sequence of the stereoisomer peptide their configuration and structure see Briand et al. 1997 PNAS 94 12545 50 and Venkataramanarao et al. 2006 Tetrahedron Letters 47 9139 9141 . However none of these methods provide any detail as to how synthesize and chemically modify the stereoisomer peptides of this invention.

Cyclization of stereoisomer peptides to create cyclo peptides is an important feature of this invention. Peptides containing several Cys residues in the core of the peptide or at the ends of each side of a linear peptide form disulfide bonds which are achieved by using a variety of oxidation reactions. Similarly methods of peptide cyclization that do not form disulfide bonds but rather create other type of bonds through linking of the terminal residues of the peptide or the side chains of residues in the peptide are also available and are known to those of skill in the art see Methods of cyclization are described by Bulaj G and Olivera B M 2008 Antioxid Redox Signal 10 1 141 55 and Amit M et al 2009. Biochemistry 48 15 3288 3303 . However none of these methods describe the actual cyclization of stereoisomer peptides with D amino acids and in the retroinverso or inverso configuration. Hence there is the need to make modifications to create ands describe procedures that include the stereoisomer peptides of this invention.

To be able to effectively deliver drugs inside tissues or cells a variety of polymers such as PLGA PCL HPMA PEG have been used because they produce tailored surface properties with specific physical chemical and biological properties that are suitable for medical applications. However the selective delivery of therapeutic agents by polymers to disease tissue or cells in vivo remains a major challenge since it depends on the particular physicochemical properties of the polymer and the drug see Zhang Y and Chu C C. 2002 J. Biomater. Appl. 16 305 325 and Liu J et al. 2004 J. Pharm. Sci. 93 132 143 and the biological pathway for delivery see Qaddoumi M G et al. 2003. Mol. Vis. 9 559 568 . In spite of this complexity polymers have been used in a variety of medical and biotechnological applications for controlled delivery of small molecules mainly cytotoxic and large biomolecules proteins and antibodies inside tissues or cells see Jeong B et al. 1997 Nature 388 860 862 Bae Y H et al. 1997. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 831 47 56 and Zhao et al. 2003 Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 55 483 499 . These methods however have never been used to carry a plurality of different stereoisomer peptides and none of them have described the conjugation or encapsulation of a plurality of stereoisomer peptides in their retroinverso and cyclic configuration. In this invention for the first time such techniques with modifications are applied to create the novel therapeutic compounds of this invention.

The synthesis of low and high molecular weight oligomeric forms of polymers such as lactide and glycolide and their applications as carriers for drug delivery was carried out several decades ago see Lewis D H. 1990. Controlled release of bioactive agents from lactide glycolide polymers. In Chasin M Langer R editors. Biodegradable polymers as drug delivery systems. New York Marcel Dekker p 1 41 and Wu X S. 1995. Synthesis and properties of biodegradable lactic glycolic acid polymers. In Wise et al. Eds. Encyclopedic Handbook of Biomaterials and Bioengineering. New York Marcel Dekker p 1015 10541 . These polymers are FDA approved and have wide acceptance in surgical procedures due to their biocompatibility and biodegradation through cleavage of its backbone ester linkages see Tice T R and Cowsar D R. 1984. Pharm Technol 11 26 35 . However none of these methods have described the conjugation or encapsulation of a plurality of stereoisomer peptides in their retroinverso and cyclic configuration with polymer PLGA. This invention presents the creation of such novel PLGA based therapeutic compounds.

Methods for encapsulation of drugs using a variety of size particles or carriers have also been described. The encapsulation of drugs entails the formation of polymer particles of a variety of sizes including nanoparticles microparticles miliparticles nanocapsules microcapsules milicapsules nanoemulsions microemulsions nanospheres microspheres and those made of a variety of substances to obtain liposomes oleosomes vesicles micelles surfactants phospholipids sponges and those made with cyclodextrines. Thus particulated polymers such as microspheres microcapsules and nanoparticles are very useful because they can be administered by different routes in vivo see Jain R A 2002 Biomaterials 21 2475 2490 and Berkland C et al. 2002 J. Control Release 82 137 147 . Polymer nanoparticles are used to encapsulate the novel polymer conjugates created in this invention.

Drugs of any size regardless of molecular weight and solubility can be loaded in the biodegradable microparticles using different manufacturing techniques. They include emulsion polymerization interfacial polymerization solvent evaporation salting out coacervation combination of sonication and layer by layer technology and solvent displacement solvent diffusion mong others. Each method of drug encapsulation requires its own specific condition for stability solubilization and control releases immune elimination see Rajiv A J. 2000 Biomaterials 21 2475 490 and Sinha V R and Trehan A. 2003. J. Control. Release 90 261 280 . The method of encapsulation therefore is entirely based on the physicochemical activity of the type of drug and its intended application. Here specific modification and combination of methods are used to create the nanoparticles loaded with the composition of matter of this invention.

Another polymer amply used in biomedical applications is HPMA due to its biocompatibility and high solubility in water. HPMA has been conjugated mainly to low molecular weight drugs to increase their therapeutic effect and reduce their toxicity e.g. toxic cancer drugs these conjugates have also been labeled with fluorescent or radiolabeled tags to analyze the biodistribution of the drug HPMA conjugate in tissues and cells. The selection of HPMA for biomedical applications relies on its extensive research well known chemical and structural properties and their suitability as carriers for drug delivery especially of toxic anti cancer molecules in many clinical applications see U.S. Pat. No. 5 037 883 Kopecek et al Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm. 2000 50 61 81 Vicent M J et al. 2008. Expert Opin Drug Deliv. 5 5 593 614 Greco F and Vicent M J. 2008. Front Biosci. 2008 13 2744 56 . Methods to synthesize HPMA to produce HPMA copolymers the characterization of their properties and the preparation of conjugates are standard and well established in the art see Europ. Polym. J. 9 7 1973 Europ. Polym. J. 10 405 1974 but none of these methods have ever been used to create the novel compounds of this invention.

In sum the methods described above for peptide synthesis their modification and their conjugation to polymers or encapsulation have never been used to create the novel ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds of this invention. Therefore this invention for the first time uses such approaches with variations to create the novel therapeutic compounds described in this specification together with the examples their representation in the figures and the claims describing the particular characteristics of the novel compounds. These compounds also provide targeted specificity to treat a particular disease and ideal biopharmaceutical properties that make them highly stable and suitable for any route of administration.

In view of the forgoing it is appreciated that these novel and unique ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds for a variety of therapeutic interventions constitute a significant advancement in the art and a new approach to treat human diseases.

This disclosure features novel ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds represented by the formula sP n L Pol P comprising a plurality of different stereoisomer peptides and a peptide ligand conjugated directly or via a linker to a biocompatible polymer wherein sP represents a plurality of synthetic stereoisomer peptides comprising D amino acids or D and unnatural amino acids or D L and unnatural amino acids having retro inverso or inverso configuration and said configuration is a cyclic or a linear structure the linear structure is alpha helix or beta sheet each stereoisomer peptide sequence is selected independently from a group of peptides targeting functional domains of disease causing proteins or proteins that positively or negatively inhibit a disease protein n is an integer of 2 to 5 stereoisomer peptides L is a cleavable or a non cleavable linker having 2 to 5 amino acid residues or is absent the amino acid residues of linker L are independently selected from the group comprising D Lys D Gly D Phe D Leu D Ser D Tyr D Glu D Gln and D Asn Pol is a biocompatible polymer and Pis a stereoisomer peptide ligand that guides the delivery of said multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compound to a tissue or a cell in the body of a mammal. The cyclic compact structure of the stereoisomer peptide is created by head to tail linking of the terminal residues or by linking the side chain amino acids of the stereoisomer peptide and wherein the sequences of two or more said stereoisomer peptides are selected independently from a group of ninety eight 98 peptides disclosed in the Sequence Listing entitled Sequence Listing ST25.txt and listed in the specification and from the group of peptides provided in the descriptions of the different target proteins.

Accordingly in one aspect stereoisomer peptides with D amino acids in linear or cyclic configuration and their analogs i.e. retro inverso and inverso configuration are ideal for therapeutic applications because they have increased stability and resist enzyme degradation allowing longer circulation in the blood. Furthermore the function of the peptide ligand which is also a stereoisomer peptide in their retro inverso or inverso configuration and linear or cyclic structure is to guide the polymer carrying the different stereoisomer peptides to the target sites including tissues cells or subcellular locations e.g. cytoplasm in the body of a mammal resulting in effective delivery and internalization of the therapeutic stereoisomer peptides.

In another aspect the invention further refers to the use of ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer compounds as useful therapeutics to treat a variety of mammalian diseases mainly resulting from abnormal angiogenesis and inflammation which are the hall mark of most human diseases which are caused by overexpression of disease causing proteins and the proteins of pathogenic microorganisms. Diseases include vascular growth pathological conditions of the eye cancer metastasis solid tumors inflammation arthritis psoriasis diabetes and cardiovascular disorders Alzheimer s Parkinson s and neurological diseases brain diseases such as bipolar disease neurodegenerative diseases diseases caused by aging and diseases caused by pathogen agents including but not limited to HIV malaria and bacterial infections caused by MRSA and the tuberculosis bacteria.

In one more aspect the group of ninety eight 98 peptides with SEQ ID NOs 1 98 disclosed in the Sequence Listing entitled Sequence Listing ST25.txt and in the description comprise peptides between 4 to 17 amino acids and constitute composition of matter of this invention. These peptides and the group of peptides listed in the descriptions of the target proteins mimic short functional domains of natural proteins that are over expressed down regulated or negatively interacting with other proteins causing a variety of human diseases or positively inhibiting disease causing proteins. Peptides selected from any group of peptides disclosed or listed in the specification are artificial sequences and not natural peptides in their L configuration. These peptides are synthetic peptides with D amino acids in their retro inverso or inverso configuration and chemically modified to obtain linear or cyclic compact structures. These structural characteristics provide unique and novel synthetic peptides that are highly stable resistant to degradation by enzymes and have extended shelf life and enhanced biological properties.

In an additional aspect a plurality of different synthetic stereoisomer peptides in their inverso or retro inverso configuration with linear or cyclic structure are conjugated to a polymer directly or via a cleavable or non cleavable linker depending on the polymer selected and then coated or encapsulated in polymer particles of different size that can range between 1 to 100 m in diameter further enhancing the physicochemical properties of the stereoisomer peptides and creating ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer compounds which constitute the composition of matter of this invention. Their enhanced properties not only provide ideal biopharmaceutical properties but allow these compounds to be used in different medical applications and be administered by different routes including but not limited to oral parenteral pulmonary topical mucosa and transdermal.

In yet another aspect this invention relates to the disclosed group of peptides which in addition of being synthesized with D amino acids in retro inverso configuration and with linear or constrained cyclic structures the constrained cyclic structure is created by a variety of methods that include head to tail linking of the terminal amino acids of the peptide creating an amide bond linking the amino acids present in the side chains of the peptide creating a cyclic amide with a lactam bond which can have a variable number of carbon atoms depending of the size of the D peptide or linking a terminal residue of the peptide with the terminal residue of a serine residue to create a thioether bond.

In another aspect a linear peptide with alpha helix configuration is stabilized by modification of amino acid residues adjacent to a motif or group of amino acids of interest. The addition of Cys residues to create a disulfide bond S S or the addition of residues such as Lys or Glu to create a lactam bridge can be used to obtain a stable cyclic construct. For peptides with long helices linking of the terminal residues creates a cyclopeptide with a stabilized alpha helix.

In one additional aspect this invention relates to the conjugation of stereoisomer peptides in their inverso or retro inverso and linear or cyclic configuration to a functional group of a separate branch of a polymer such as PLGA PLA PCL HPMA or PEG directly or via a linker that can be cleavable or non cleavable. The stereoisomer peptides can also be directly conjugated to a polymer and then encapsulated in polymer particles of a desired size e.g. nanoparticles that have been conjugated to a ligand to create unique and novel ligand targeted nanoparticles loaded with multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds.

In yet another aspect the peptide ligand also containing D amino acids in retro inverso or inverso configuration and linear or cyclic structures but preferably cyclic structure is conjugated directly to a branch of the polymer or on the surface of polymer particles loaded with different stereoisomer peptides that have been directly conjugated with the selected polymer. The function of the peptide ligand is to guide the delivery of the polymer carrying a plurality of different linear or cyclic stereoisomer peptides in their retro inverso or inverso configuration directly to the target site which is a tissue cell or a subcellular compartment e.g. cytoplasm in the body of a mammal.

In one more aspect the peptide ligand include but is no limited to high affinity receptor peptides transport peptides transduction domain peptides chemotactic peptides and cell penetrating peptides which in this invention are also synthetic stereoisomer peptides.

In another aspect polymers used to create compounds to deliver drugs inside tissues or cells and cell compartments are selected from preferred polymers that include poly lactic co glycolic acid PLGA polylactic acid PLA Poly caprolactone N 2 Hydroxypropyl methacrylamide HPMA and HPMA co monomers and polyethylene Glycol PEG . A linker can be attached to the polymer and used to conjugate a stereoisomer peptide. The linker can be cleavable or non cleavable and may comprise two to five amino acid residues by addition or substitution preferably selected from the residues D Phe D Leu D Lys D Gly D Ser D Tyr D Gln D Glu D Trp and D Asn. In the case of stabilizing alpha helix D peptides small cycles can be created by adding D Cys D Lys or D Glu residues to the adjacent amino acids containing a motif of interest or by adding a D Cys residue at each end of the peptide to create a disulfide bond. This bond can also be created by linking the ends of the terminal amino acids of the stereoisomer peptide to create a peptide bond. See examples of bonds created by cyclization of peptides in .

In one more aspect the stereoisomer peptides can be conjugated to a polymer or encapsulated in a polymer particle of a determined size. Conjugation of peptides is achieved by using the available functional groups in the polymer s backbone. In the case of polymers without a functional group in their backbone amino acid residues such as lysine are incorporated in the polymer chain during copolymerization to provide a functional group. This functional group can then be used to conjugate the peptide. Encapsulation of peptides in a polymer particle or composite particle formation is an important process for the controlled release of drugs. Polymer particles can have a variety of sizes including nanoparticles microparticles miliparticles nanocapsules microcapsules milicapsules nanoemulsions microemulsions nanospheres microspheres and those made of a variety of substances to obtain liposomes oleosomes vesicles micelles surfactants phospholipids sponges and those made with cyclodextrines. The preferred polymer particles are nanoparticles.

In yet another aspect this invention relates to using the polymer as specific intracellular carrier for the delivery of multi targeted stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds to cells via the endocytic pathway. This well characterized cell pathway allows the internalization of polymers such as PLGA PCL LA PLA HPMA or PEG with its cargo mainly via clathrin and caveolin 1 independent pathways. The D peptides inside the cells are released from the polymer in the cell cytoplasm where the target proteins are found. This is achieved by enzymatic cleavage of the linkers and by the gradual release of the conjugated stereoisomer peptides located inside the polymer nanoparticles. The specific stereoisomer peptide ligand conjugated in the surface of nanoparticles guides the polymer with its cargo into the tissues or cells for targeted delivery. Direct conjugation of peptides to a polymer and or their encapsulation in nanoparticles has sustained release capabilities at the target site e.g. tumor or in the intracellular lysosomal compartment where the nanoparticles are normally located after endocytosis.

This invention further refers to stereoisomer peptides that target physiologically and structurally relevant functional domains of proteins of interest. Domains include substrate specific and receptor sites protein protein interaction sites docking sites for proteins or receptors interaction protein specific folding loops divalent metal ions sites glycosilation and phosphorylation sites and cell membrane and transmembrane domains. The desired effect of each stereoisomer peptide is to prevent inhibit or block the binding of a protein or a receptor or a specific substrate or an organic or inorganic molecule to the target protein. The peptide may disrupt protein protein interactions protein loop folding ionic interactions or the binding of substrates or the phosphorylation and glycosilation of proteins or the interaction with the cell membrane. Therefore the peptides are suppressing eliminating preventing abolishing blocking or disrupting the physiological activity and or the conformational structure of the target protein in a mammalian e.g. animal or human cell or a protein important for the function and survival of an infectious microorganism. Thus their function is to act as peptide antagonists. In the case of stereoisomer peptides targeting proteins that positively inhibit a disease protein their function is to act as an agonist.

VEGF A is the predominant stimulator of angiogenesis and controls tissue vasculature under normal physiologic conditions through a regulated mechanism of expression. Under pathologic conditions however VEGF acts on endothelial cells of existing blood vessels to promote new blood vessel formation and in the majority of cancers VEGF is secreted by tumor cells. VEGF initiates the angiogenic process by activating endothelial cells and promoting their migration inducing the angiogenic switch which is critical to the growth and malignant dissemination metastases of solid tumors. Free VEGF binds the receptors VEGFR1 Flt 1 and VEGFR2 Flk 1 or KDR and its expression is driven by oncogene expression and hypoxia and mediates the effects of other angiogenic molecules playing a central role in the control of tumor angiogenesis. VEGF is therefore the key mediator of vasculogenesis angiogenic remodeling and angiogenic sprouting. Given the role of VEGF in cancer and in angiogenesis related diseases VEGF is the favorite target to develop therapeutics capable of inhibiting its activity under abnormal physiological conditions.

In one embodiment preferred representative peptides mimicking specific functional domains of VEGF including the binding site for heparin and receptor and the site for dimerization and function of VEGF have the sequences SEQ ID NOs 7 17 20 22 25 28 82 and 124 128.

Heat shock proteins are a group of highly conserved molecular chaperones which respond to cellular stresses. Heat shock protein 90 Hsp90 is an essential chaperon for function and integrity of a wide range of oncogenic client proteins like hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha HIF 1a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 STAT3 intracellular kinases Akt Erk epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR and insulin like growth factor receptor IGFR . HSP90 is constitutively expressed at high levels in many cancers gastric liver Hodgkin lymphoma . Inhibition or blockade of Hsp90 would improve anti tumoral and anti angiogenic effects of drugs such as rapamycin and potentially blocking oncogenic signaling molecules. Hsp90 is involved in a variety of regulatory functions including regulation of phosphorylation of SGK 1 which contributes to malignant epithelial cell proliferation. Hsp90 interacts with raptor and regulates mTOR signaling upon T cell activation regulates Jak STAT signaling in cells and modulates the redox status of cytosol in resting and apoptotic cells by reducing Cytochrome C.

In another embodiment HSP70 family contains at least eight distinct members including HSC70 HSP70 8 or HSP73 in the cytoplasm and nucleus and HSP72 HSP70 HSP70 1A or HSP70 1B in the cytoplasm nucleus lysosome. Their functions include nascent protein folding preventing formation of protein aggregates assisting re folding of denatured proteins facilitating their degradation when proteins cannot be repaired modulating the assembly disassembly of protein complexes aiding the translocation of proteins across cellular membranes and inhibiting cell death. Sometimes these functions are undesirable if the protein being stabilized by the heat shock protein is a disease protein. HSP70 levels are abnormally high in a wide variety of tumor cell types and contribute to tumorigenesis and resistance to chemotherapy. HSP70 iso configurations HSP72 and HSC70 are induced in colon and ovarian cancer cell lines exposed to HSP90 inhibitors and HSC70 modulates HCV infectivity. Important domains of these proteins include ATPase and substrate binding and the interaction with the HSP organizing protein. Based on the antiapoptotic function of HSP70 iso configurations and their essential role in the substrate loading phase of the HSP90 chaperone cycle it is important to find inhibitors to silence the activities of both HSP72 and HSC70 and to indirectly inhibit HSP90 chaperone function which may potentially lead to a greater apoptotic effect than that observed with pharmacologic HSP90 inhibitors. The substrate binding sites of heat shock proteins and their interactions with proteins are of functional importance since substrates bind with high affinity and specificity to the C termini of HSP70 HSP72 and HSC70.

In yet another embodiment preferred peptides mimicking domains of Hsp90 and the C termini of the protein include the sequences SEQ ID NOs 74 and 133 144. Stabilization of these sequences including the alpha helix peptides is achieved by cyclization of the terminal Cys residues creating a disulfide bond or by head to tail cyclization of the terminal residues at each end of the stereoisomer peptide.

In one additional embodiment these heat shock related peptides and peptides of other groups are selected independently to create novel ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds for the potential treatment of diseases caused by a variety of cancers and eye pathologies including but not limited to age related macular degeneration choroidal neovascularization diabetic retinopathy and macular edema.

Depending on the phosphorylation site on the carbohydrate PIKs include phosphoinositide 3 kinases PI3Ks phosphoinositide 4 kinases PIP4Ks and phosphoinositide 5 kinases PIP5Ks . PI3Ks are further grouped in three classes depending on their subunit structure their regulation and their substrate selectivity and each class contains various iso configurations. The PI3K pathway is linked to cancer development and is activated by several growth cofactors and oncogenes. Class I PI3K is a tyrosine kinase that mediates through its p110a subunit enzymatic activity the mitogenic signal transduction pathway. P13K is also an effector molecule that interacts with the cytoplasmic domains of growth factor receptors through adaptor subunits containing SH2 domains. P13K Atk pathway is activated in multiple myeloma and p13K mTOR is activated in pancreatic cancer. Malignant gliomas commonly over express the oncogenes EGFR and PDGFR which contain mutations and deletions of the tumor suppressor genes PTEN and TP53 leading to activation of the P13K Akt and Ras MAPK pathways. Gonadotropin FSH acts via its receptor stimulating the PI3K AKT pathway. Activation of this pathway occurs in solid tumors including ovarian epithelial tumors through mutation of the PI3K subunit genes or inactivation of the tumor suppressor PTEN. Peptides

TAK 1 is a member of the MAPK kinase and a key regulator in the pro inflammatory signaling pathway that can be activated by TGF Beta IL 1Beta TNF alpha and toll like receptor ligands. In cells TAK 1 can exist as the catalytic component of two different complexes TAK 1 TAB1 TAB2 or TAK 1 TAB1 TAB3. TAK 1 binding protein 1 is required for TAK 1 activity. TAB2 and TAB3 are adapter proteins containing ubiquitin binding domains which are required for the activation of TAK 1 once activated it activates the NF kappa B pathway by interacting with the TNF alpha receptor associated factor TRAF and phosphorylating the NF kappa B inducing kinase. TAK 1 phosphorylation also correlates with phosphorylation at Thr 187 and activation of the p38a and JNK pathways via phosphorylation of MAP kinase MKK 3 6 and MKK4 7 respectively. Signaling pathways downstream of TNF alpha are also severely impaired in TAK 1 deficient cells hence the importance of TAK 1 in the pro inflammatory signaling pathways. The activation of NF kappa B is linked to the development and progression of human cancers such as hepatocellular prostate and breast carcinoma and to the conversion of TGF beta from a suppressor to a promoter of mammary tumorigenesis. The inhibition of important domains of TAK 1 protein provides targets for the development of therapeutics to treat a variety of cancers.

In another embodiment preferred alpha helix peptides mimicking the catalytic domain the ATP binding site and phosphorylation sites of TAK 1 include the sequences SEQ ID NOs 150 152. Further cyclization of these peptides enhances their stability.

In one more embodiment peptides from this and other related groups are independently selected to create novel ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds for the potential treatment of pancreatic liver prostate and breast cancers.

Mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR is a large multidomain serine threonine protein kinase which plays a central role in the regulation of cell growth cell proliferation cell motility cell survival protein synthesis and transcription. This protein is present in cells as mTORC1 and mTORC2 which contain a known binding partner mLST8 GbL but differ in that the third protein component of mTORC1 is raptor and of mTORC2 is rictor mTORC2 is involved in regulating the assembly of the actin cytoskeleton in cells and is a key activator of the protein kinase Akt an essential component of the insulin PI3K signaling pathway. Akt indirectly activates mTORC1 via phosphorylation induced inhibition of the complex formed by the tuberous sclerosis proteins TSC1 and TSC2 which acts as a negative regulator of mTORC1 activity mTORC1 is a downstream effector of mTORC2. Thus mTOR is an essential target of survival signals in many types of human cancer cells and its activity is modulated by leucine rapamycin and phosphatidic acid the last two bind to the FRB domain of mTOR.

In one embodiment many conditions that shift cells from states of nutrient utilization and growth to states of cell maintenance and repair extend lifespan. Inhibition of the nutrient sensor target of rapamycin mTOR increases lifespan. Although rapamycin is used extensively for treating cancers and is extremely selective for mTOR this drug has very low bioavailability and can potentially activate pathways that could maintain mTOR active therefore leading to treatment failure. Thus the development of selective mTOR kinase inhibitors with higher stability resistance and bioavailability is an important unmet medical need.

In another embodiment preferred linear peptides mimicking functional domains of mTOR including the ATP binding site and FRB domain which is the site for binding rapamycin phospatydic acid and leucine include the sequences SEQ ID NOs 153 164. Cyclization of these peptides using a variety of approaches will further enhance their stability.

In an additional embodiment peptides from this and other related groups are selected independently to create novel ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds for the potential treatment of renal ovarian prostate and liver cancers and as an anti aging.

The dependence of cancerous tumors on nutrients and oxygen for growth via angiogenesis new vessels formation is facilitated by VEGF which is secreted by tumors inducing a mitogenic response through its binding to one of three tyrosine kinase receptors VEGFR 1 2 and 3 on nearby endothelial cells. VEGFR1 is a positive regulator of macrophage migration and regulates VEGFR2 signaling by acting as a decoy receptor VEGFR2 mediates the major growth effects and permeability associated with VEGF whereas VEGFR3 is essential for lymphatic vessel formation. Thus inhibition of this signaling pathway should block angiogenesis and subsequent tumor growth. Endothelial expression of VEGFR2 closely parallels VEGF expression in angiogenic responses. Suppression of the VEGF VEGFR2 signaling pathway interferes with new blood vessel formation and thus they are targets for therapeutics. VEGFR 2 also plays a pivotal role in choroidal neovascularization CNV development it is detected on retinal progenitor cells and is generally considered to promote new vessels.

In one embodiment preferred peptides mimicking VEGFR2 s catalytic domain the ATP and substrate binding sites the activation loop and the amino acids that directly interact or bind inhibitors include the sequences SEQ ID NOs 31 and 165 169. Cyclization of these peptides using various approaches further enhances their stability.

In another embodiment peptides from this and other related groups are selected independently to create novel ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds for the potential treatment of pathological conditions of the eye like age related macular degeneration choroidal neovascularization diabetic retinopathy and macular edema malignant brain tumors thyroid carcinomas and breast and cervical cancers.

The platelet derived growth factor PDGF family a potent mitogen for a wide variety of cell types of mesenchymal origin is a target of interest. The PDGF family consists of four members PDGF A PDGF B PDGF C and PDGF D which exert their biological effects by binding as homo or heterodimers to two receptor tyrosine kinases PDGFRa and PDGFRb . PDGF AA PDGF AB PDGF BB and PDGF CC dimers bind to PDGFRa with high affinity whereas PDGF BB and PDGF DD dimers preferentially bind PDGFR b. PDGF signaling is critical for embryonic development whereas in the adult it is important in wound healing and in the control of interstitial fluid pressure. PDGF is an important factor in regulating angiogenesis and tumor cells. Glioblastomas fibrosarcomas and osteosarcomas often coexpress PDGF ligands and their cognate receptors leading to autocrine stimulation of tumor cell growth. Both PDGFRa and PDGFRb signaling seems to be involved in the regulation of various angiogenic pathways and stromal cell functions. Thus combined inhibition of PDGFRa and PDGFR b results in markedly decreased tumor growth in vivo because of impaired recruitment of peri endothelial cells. PDGFRa is implicated in the growth of gliomas uterine sarcomas renal cell carcinoma and non small cell lung cancer and PDGFR beta is implicated in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia renal and non small cell lung cancer gastric and esophageal cancers.

In one embodiment preferred peptides mimicking short sequences of the catalytic domain and the substrate ATP and phosphorylation binding sites important for the overall activity of PDGFRa and PDGFRb include the sequences SEQ ID NOs 170 176. These short peptides are further stabilized by cyclization.

In another embodiment peptides from this and other related groups are selected independently to create novel ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds for the potential treatment of gliomas uterine sarcomas renal cell carcinoma and non small cell lung cancer chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and gastric and esophageal cancers.

PC cell derived growth factor PCGDF known as proepithelin PEPI granulin epithelin precursor GP88 progranulin and acrogranin plays a critical role in development cell cycle progression cell motility and tumorigenesis. This 90 KDa protein comprise 6 KDa fragments named granulin A B C D E F and G that correspond to individual domains that have been isolated from a variety of human tissues. The PCDGF gene plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and in several breast cancer cells and its expression correlates with an aggressive phenotype. Over expression of PCGDF plays a significant role in adipocytic teratoma glioblastomas multiple myeloma and renal cell gastric and ovarian carcinomas. It also promotes migration wound healing and invasion of bladder cancer cells supporting the evidence that PCGDF or proepithelin play as well a critical role in bladder and prostate cancers and stimulates invasive behavior. Mutations in the PCDGF gene cause front temporal dementia leading to neuro degeneration hence its critical function in regulating survival of neuronal cells. Inhibiting PCDGF impedes the proliferation of breast cancer cells MDCK renotubular epithelium ovarian carcinoma the proliferation of human glioblastomas in culture all of which are cells from tumor types associated with elevated PCGDF gene expression. PCDGF is therefore an interesting therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer.

In one embodiment preferred peptides mimicking the sequence domains of three different epithelin modules epithelin A D and F located within the PCGDF protein sequence include the sequences SEQ ID NOs 177 191

In another embodiment these cys rich peptides form 2 to 6 disulfide bonds via oxidation of SH groups allowing the formation of constrained cyclic structures. Peptides from this and other related groups are selected independently to create novel ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds for the potential treatment of glioblastomas anaplastic astrocytomas oligodendrogliomas uterine sarcomas renal cell carcinoma non small cell lung cancer chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and renal prostate breast gastric and esophageal cancers and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.

Neuropilin 1 and 2 NRP land NRP 2 non tyrosine kinase transmembrane glycoproteins that share 44 sequence homology are overexpresed in most cancers. Expression of neuropilins is found in neurons on inflammatory cells vascular smooth muscle cells endothelial cells and tumor cells. Neuropilins are not kinases and can signal via their short intracellular domain directly by recruiting synectin to the cell membrane. NRP expression on tumor cells is correlated with a malignant phenotype in melanoma prostate pancreatic cancers and the formation of tumor associated lymphatics in lung metastasis. In colorectal cancer NRP regulates tumor growth. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma PDAC NRP 2 shows greater expression than in nonmalignant ductal epithelium. NRP 2 in colorectal carcinoma plays a role in several critical aspects of the malignant NPR 2 in PDAC is involved in survival signaling migration invasion and anchorage independent growth in vitro. In vivo cells deficient in NRP 2 had decreased tumor growth also associated with a decrease in Jagged 1 expression a member of the Notch family of ligands and receptors in the tumor cells. Thus the reduction of tumor growth may be due to the secondary effect on angiogenesis since there is a decrease in functional vasculature within the tumor. This molecule is therefore a potential therapeutic target.

In one embodiment preferred peptides mimicking sequences in the a domain of Neuropilin 2 NRP 2 with ala2 structures important for the binding of Sema3A to neuropilin and sequences in the b domain with blb2 structures important for the binding of VEGF 165 to neuropilin include the sequences SEQ ID NOs 12 17 20 37 and 192 196.

In another embodiment these peptides have terminal cys residues that form disulfide bonds via oxidation of SH groups creating compact cyclic structures. Peptides from this and other related groups are selected to create novel ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds for the potential treatment of breast prostate colorectal and pancreatic cancers melanoma lung metastasis and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

In one additional embodiment P53 protein known as the guardian of the genome and master regulator of apoptosis and other forms of cell death is a tumor suppressor protein encoded by the TP53 gene. This protein is crucial in multicellular organisms. It regulates the cell cycle and is involved in the prevention of cancer by maintaining the stability of the genome preventing mutations that lead to cancer. A common polymorphism of TP53 gene involves the substitution of an arginine residue for a proline residue at codon position 72. This mutation has been linked to a variety of cancers like pancreatic breast renal and lung cancers among others and more than 50 of human tumors contain a mutation or deletions of the TP53 gene. There is ample evidence of the association of p53 with MDM2 protein Murine Double Minute 2 and tumorigenesis in a variety of human cancers. Accumulation of mutated p53 in the cancer cell allows p53 to gain new oncogenic functions contributing to transformation and metastasis. While current studies find that the Akt signaling pathway phosphorylates MDM2 leading to the nuclear translocation and degradation of the tumor suppressor p53 protein it is also observed that MDM2 activates the Akt signaling pathway through an interaction with REST repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor conferring survival advantage to cancer cells independently of p53 status. Thus it is important not only to target the interaction between p53 and MDM2 with novel drugs which will inhibit MDM2 and indirectly Akt kinase see Pk13 Atk addressed above to prevent its activation and the inhibition of wild type oncogene suppressor p53.

In one more embodiment preferred peptides sequences to target MDM2 to prevent p53 MDM2 interaction include the sequences SEQ ID NOs 14 16 21 37 and 251 253. Cyclization of these peptides further enhances their stability. Since MDM2 is found in most cancers down regulating p53 peptides from this and other related groups are selected to create novel ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds for the potential treatment of a variety of cancers.

The integrins v 3 and 5 1 receptors for a variety of extracellular matrix proteins like vitronectin or fibronectin play a major role in cancer. The interaction of integrin 5 1 with its main ligand in the extracellular matrix fibronectin is known to influence the survival of tumor cells and to favor their proliferation by modulating apoptosis through the upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins or the suppression of apoptotic mediators. Furthermore this activity is enhanced by the presence of both the RGD motif and the peptide PHSRN for interaction with fibronectin integrin 5 1 is also involved in the development of choroidal neovascularization CNV and other cancers. Thus inhibition of 5 1 may provide an alternative to the current standard for cancer and CNV theraphies which involves inhibition of VEGF which is not effective in the majority of cases. Integrin v 3 is also involved in cancer it has been reported to be strongly expressed on activated endothelial cells and cancer cells. It is over expressed in melanoma glioblastoma ovarian and breast cancer therefore v 3 is also an attractive protein target for cancer therapy. High affinity v 3 and 5 1 integrin ligands block these integrins and inhibit angiogenesis induce endothelial apoptosis decrease tumor growth and reduce invasiveness and spread of metastasis. Both v 3 and 5 1 are therefore protein targets for cancer therapy.

In one embodiment preferred peptides mimicking sequences of Alpha v eta integrins or targeting v 3 and 5 1 include the sequences SEQ ID NOs 8 9 38 41 43 50 96 and 97 197 202 and 254 255.

In another embodiment these peptides mostly with cys residues target key domains important for the interaction of calcium and the amino acid residues that bind with the tripeptide motive found in a variety of growth factors such as IGF I extracellular matrix proteins and receptor ligands integrins . The peptides form disulfide bonds via oxidation of SH groups creating compact cyclic structures. These residues can be exchanged for non Cys residues to form amide bonds. Peptides from this and other related groups are selected independently to create novel ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds for the potential treatment of breast prostate colorectal and pancreatic cancers tumor growth and metastasis rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis restenosis and eye diseases including age related macular degeneration choroidal neovascularization diabetic retinopathy and macular edema

Chemokines small proinflammatory chemoattractant cytokines that bind to G protein coupled seven span transmembrane receptors are major regulators of cellular trafficking. Chemokines induce direct migration of leukocytes along a chemical gradient of ligand s and their production is stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines growth factors and in general by pathogenic stimuli arising in inflammatory tissues. In diseased tissues different tumor cell types trigger a complex chemokine network that influences the quality and quantity of immune cell infiltration and consequently malignant cell proliferation survival spread and angiogenic response. CCL is as a product of activated T cells and an inflammatory chemokine. CCL5 mediates chemotactic activity in T cells monocytes dendritic cells natural killer cells eosinophils and basophiles it is also associated with chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. CCL5 expression levels are associated with melanoma lung prostate pancreatic cancers and breast cancer and correlate with disease progression it also modulates cell migration and invasion in several cancer cells. Interaction of CCL5 with its specific receptor CCR on the surface of cancer cells induces cancer invasion. CCL5 and receptor CCR5 increases the migration and expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMPs found in human oral cancer cells.

In one embodiment the implications of CCL5 with inflammatory diseases and cancer the protein is a target of interest to develop novel therapeutics. Human eosinophils also respond to a variety of CC chemokines like eotaxin eotaxin 2 eotaxin 3 which are regulated by T cell expressed and secreted RANTES monocyte chemoattractant protein MCP 2 MCP 3 and MCP 4 through binding to the CC chemokine receptor 3 CCR3 . CCR3 a seven transmembrane domain G coupled receptor is expressed in eosinophils Th2 T cells and mast cells. Because of its action on eosinophils and on many cell types that are crucial for induction of an allergic response eotaxin and the CCR3 receptor are targets of interest for therapeutic intervention.

In another embodiment preferred peptides mimicking important functional domains of CCL5 and putative receptor binding sites of CCR1 CCR3 CCR4 or CCR5 include the sequences SEQ ID NOs 203 205.

In one additional embodiment these peptides have terminal Cys residues that form disulfide bonds via oxidation of SH groups creating constrained cyclic peptides. The last peptide mimics a short sequence of the eosinophil eotaxin receptor of CCR3. Peptides from this and other related groups are selected independently to create novel ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds for the potential treatment of diseases caused by inflammatory responses and cancers.

In one more embodiment multiple pairs of chemokines and their receptors play critical roles in cancer progression. CXCL16 a ligand for CXCR6 are expressed in a variety of tissues and cells including activated endothelial cells Hodgkin s disease derived tumor cells and tumor associated macrophages rectal cancer . CXCL16 also functions as a potent and direct activator of nuclear factor nB and induces nB dependent proinflammatory gene transcription through heterotrimeric G proteins PI3K PDK 1 Akt and InB kinase. It also plays a role in the development and progression of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Proangiogenic CXCL16 is also a transmembrane molecule transported to the cell surface. The receptor CXCL16R constitutively expresses in bone marrow and in prostate tissues via CXCR6. The CXCR6 AKT mTOR pathway plays a central role in the development of prostate cancer PCa and alterations of CXCR6 over expression are associated with invasive growth and angiogenic activities of PCa cells. Thus blocking the CXCR6 AKT mTOR signaling pathway is likely to have an antimetastatic effect.

In yet another embodiment preferred peptides mimicking functional domain located within a loop created by a disulfide bond domain of CXCR6 include the sequences SEQ ID NOs 39 40 206 208.

In still another embodiment peptides from this and other related groups are selected independently to create novel ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds for the potential treatment of prostate cancer.

Proteins as Inhibitors of Angiogenesis HIV Tat Collagen Thrombospondin TSP 1 Collagen IV and XVIII and Anti Angiogenesis Brain Inhibitor ABI 

HIV proteins like gp120 gp41 Tat Vif protease integrase and reverse transciptase contain important amino acid motifs that interact with integrins which in turn mediate binding of virus surface protein to CD4 cells. Tat a potent transactivator of viral transcription binds to cellular factors and mediates their phosphorylation resulting in increased transcription of all virus genes providing a positive feedback cycle. PCDGF Granulin E region binds to HIV Tat protein suppressing transactivation by HIV 1 Tat a key progression factor of Kaposi s sarcoma KS due to the presence of amino acid motifs that bind v 3 integrin promoting its angiogenic activity in vivo. Thus inhibition of Tat production or prevention of its activity could be a way to inhibit the development and progression of KS in AIDS patients. Tat Cys rich and basic domains have positive modulatory effect by inhibiting a variety of growth factors receptors and cellular activities. HIV Tat inhibit VEGF165 by binding to KDR and neuropilin 1 NP 1 receptors in endothelial cells. Tat inhibits VEGF induced ERK activation and mitogenesis in endothelial cells it also inhibits angiogenesis in vitro inhibit ERK activation induced by basic fibroblast growth factor and induce cell apoptosis. These properties of HIV 1 Tat protein and its fragments indicate that their major effect in endothelial cells is apoptosis independent of specific inhibition of VEGF receptor activation.

In one embodiment preferred peptides mimicking domains of HIV tat protease vif reverse transcriptase and gp120 sequences important for binding to integrins potentially inhibiting cellular processes or pathways related to angiogenesis and viral infection include the sequences SEQ ID NOs 19 24 30 32 33 54 58 90 91 98 and 209 211.

In another embodiment the peptides are modified to include terminal Cys residues that form disulfide bonds via oxidation of SH groups creating constrained cyclic structures. Peptides from this and other related groups are selected independently to create novel ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds for the potential treatment of abnormal angiogenesis induced by the overexpresion of growth factors such as VEGF 165 neuropilin KDR receptor integrin and to inhibit HIV.

In one additional embodiment Type IV and XVIII collagen have positive effects by inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation migration and tube formation. They contain endogenous domains with antiangiogenic activity. For example Type IV Collagen has a domain tumstatin with antiangiogenic activity mediated by a1 1 integrin. Type XVII collagen has a domain endostatin with antiangiogenic activity. Both collagen gen types suppress VEGF and have anti tumor activity. The protein inhibits phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase via binding to 5 1 integrin it is implicated in several signaling pathways including down regulation of c myc and RhoA activity blockage of VEGF signaling inhibition of the wnt signaling pathway and inactivation of metalloproteinases. The association of XVIII collagen with laminin and heparin indicates that different regions of the protein carry out different biological functions and the disulfide bonds are important for the stability and activity of the protein.

In one more embodiment a peptide located near to the C termini of the alpha 1 type XVIII collagen isoconfiguration 3 precursor has sequence SEQ ID NO 4 6 11 49 69 and 212. The cys residues form a disulfide bond via oxidation of SH groups creating a constrained cyclic peptide.

In other embodiment this peptide together with peptides of related groups are selected independently to create a novel ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compound for the potential treatment of abnormal angiogenesis pathological conditions of the eye including age related macular degeneration choroidal neovascularization diabetic retinopathy and macular edema and cancer.

In one more embodiment Thrombospondin 1 TSP 1 and brain specific angiogenesis inhibitor BSAI are naturally occurring inhibitor of angiogenesis. TSP 1 is a large multifunctional glycoprotein secreted by most epithelial cells and is involved in the organization of the perivascular matrix. TSP 1 blocks all the functions of activated endothelial cells and strongly mitigates tumor growth and metastases while its absence enhances these effects. Expression of TSP 1 correlates inversely with malignant progression in melanoma lung and breast carcinoma. The antiangiogenic effect of TSP 1 has potential as therapeutic for cancer but the many biological activities of TSP 1 make its use very difficult as a cancer therapeutic. TSP 1 has domains that bind to receptors such as two proteoglycan sulfatide receptors the integrin v 3 CD36 and integrin associated protein IAP . Given the recognition of these domains by various receptor proteins they are targets of interest to develop potential therapeutic compounds with antiangiogenic activities. Brain specific angiogenesis inhibitor BSAI like TSP 1 also contains similar recognition domains for integrins.

In one additional embodiment preferred peptides mimicking domains of TSP 1 and BSAI with terminal Cys residues forming disulfide bonds via oxidation of SH groups creating constrained cyclic structures include the sequences SEQ ID NOs 2 3 13 23 42 89 92 93 and 213 215.

In yet another embodiment peptides from this and other related groups are selected independently to create novel ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds for the potential treatment of abnormal angiogenesis cancer and pathological conditions of the eye including age related macular degeneration choroidal neovascularization diabetic retinopathy and macular edema.

The knowledge that lithium is used to treat mood and manic depressive illness as well as acute brain injuries like ischemia and chronic neurodegeneration which are attributed to decreased expression of neurotrophins like BDNF and VEGF is advantageous. However its beneficial effects which include mood stabilization behavioral amelioration and neurogenesis are indirect the drug inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3 GSK 3 a serine threonine protein kinase which also promotes catenin dependent transcriptional events. Furthermore other antidepressants up regulate expression of IGF I which in turn up regulates brain derived neurotrophic factor BDNF its receptor TrkB and GSK 3 which controls cell membrane signal to gene transcription protein translation cytoskeletal organization neuronal polarity and cell survival apoptosis. Thus the role of lithium on GSK 3 inhibition is complex since GSK 3 has many pleiotropic roles.

GSK 3 is regulated by different signaling pathways via phosphorylation subcellular translocation and interaction with other proteins and is enriched in the nervous system. In addition GSK 3 is constitutively active in nonstimulated cells under the basal quiescent state it continuously phosphorylates signaling molecules like glycogen synthase transcription factors like catenin translational initiation factor eIF2B and structural proteins like tau thereby keeping these GSK 3 substrates in an inactive state or promoting their degradation. Stimulation of a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases phosphorylate GSK 3 3 this phosphorylation event inhibits the catalytic activity of GSK 3 3 thereby turning on signaling pathways otherwise constitutively suppressed by GSK 3 3 in nonstimulated quiescent cells. Thus GSK 3 is of interest because its dysregulated hyperactivity is associated with insulin resistance diabetes mellitus tumorigenesis inflammation and neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Catenin is phosphorylated by GSK 3 leading to its proteasomal degradation lithium prevents GSK 3 catalyzed phosphorylation of catenin enabling catenin to accumulate and translocate to the nucleus where it facilitates gene transcription.

It is clear that GSK 3 catenin pathway is the convergent therapeutic target of lithium and various classical neuropsychiatric drugs ameliorating behavior mood anxiety cognition and neurogenesis. Although lithium inhibits GSK3 however it is not effective for all psychiatry disorders. Controlled studies with this drug for the treatment of mania and bipolar depression unipolar depression schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder revealed that this drug is most effective in bipolar disorder with minimal or no therapeutic effects in other neuropsychiatric disorders. However there is no conclusive neurochemical data that this is the case. Therefore given the pleiotropic roles of GSK3 and the lack of full understanding on how lithium works including the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder GSK 3 is a target to develop newer treatments for this disorder and other neurodegenerative diseases of the brain like Alzheimer s disease. Drugs for Alzheimer s disease have not shown significant likelihood of success hence the opportunity to develop innovative drugs for this unmet medical need.

In one embodiment preferred peptides mimicking functional domains of GSK 3 including phosphorylation substrate binding pocket and ATP binding sites which are essential for GSK 3 function include the sequences SEQ ID NOs 63 65 68 70 72 75 81 and 216 219.

In another embodiment peptides from this and other related groups are selected to create novel ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds for the potential treatment of neurodegeneration Alzheimer s disease and bipolar disease.

Infectious agents called prions the cause of fatal neurodegenerative disorders of mammals characterized by a pathological process mediated by an abnormal configuration of a physiological protein called prion are important target for therapeutic intervention. Under certain circumstances prion protein in nervous tissue assumes a formation rendering the protein resistant to normal physiological turnover processes. The abnormal prion accumulates in nervous tissue resulting in the typical spongiform changes. A prion is therefore a fatal infectious agent composed primarily of protein that affects the structure of the brain or other neural tissue. Prion has alpha helical formation and resides on the surface of cell membranes when it misfolds acquires high beta sheet content and assembles into rods that coalesce aggregating extracellularly within the central nervous system to configuration amyloid plaques which disrupt the normal tissue structure. Diseases caused by prions in humans include Creutzfeldt Jakob disease and Alzheimer s disease among others. PRNP the gene for the normal protein show mutations in all inherited cases of prion disease. The mutations change the normal protein into the abnormal configuration.

Parkinson s disease PD an age related neurodegenerative disease and characterized by a loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta coupled with proteinaceous inclusions in nerve cells and terminals known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites respectively is an important target for drug intervention. PD pathology affects nondopamine neurons in the upper and lower brainstem olfactory system cerebral hemisphere spinal cord and autonomic nervous system. The cause of cell death in PD is unknown but proteolytic stress with the accumulation of misfolded proteins is implicated. Lewy bodies are the hallmark of PD and are composed of aggregated proteins that include alpha synuclein NACP . Similar to prion alpha synuclein acquires a largely alpha helical formation when it binds to cell membranes. When alpha synuclein misfolds it acquires high beta sheet content and polymerizes into fibrils that are associated with the formation of Lewy bodies. Over expression of alpha synuclein alone can induce PD syndrome in animals and humans. Alpha synuclein behaves like a prion and thus PD seems to be a prion disorder. Since both prion and alpha synuclein lead to a prion disorder both proteins are target molecules of interest.

In one embodiment preferred peptides mimicking domains of PrP Alpha synuclein blocking phosphorylation and KTK repeats of NACP protein include the sequences SEQ ID NOs 34 45 48 64 83 88 and 220 224.

In another embodiment the peptides are designed with motives similar to the kringle domain repeats of plasminogen to bind prion protein. Peptides from this and other related group are selected independently to create novel ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds for the potential treatment of CJD PD Alzheimer s and neurodegeneration.

The knowledge that CNS neurons normally do not regenerate after damage due to inhibitors of axon regeneration in CNS myelin since different proteins expressed on mature oligodendrocytes cause axonal growth cones to collapse and thus arrest further growth is of high interest for therapeutic intervention. Neurotrophic factors and growth associated proteins which are expressed in injured peripheral nerves are often absent in the adult CNS. Furthermore proteoglycan rich glial scar at the lesion site configurations a physical and molecular barrier to re growth. Thus a major goal in the search for therapies for spinal cord injuries SCIs is to develop drugs that promote both the regeneration of damaged axons and the restoration of synaptic contacts with their appropriate targets. The axon regeneration inhibitor Nogo is a myelin associated neurite outgrowth inhibitor. Nogo myelin associated glycoprotein and oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein are interesting targets to develop spinal cord injury therapeutics. Activation of NgR results in a decrease in cellular cAMP. Another protein of interest with a role in the hypothalamous region of the brain is somatostatin a peptide hormone that regulates the endocrine system and affects neurotransmission and cell proliferation via interaction with G protein coupled somatostatin receptors. Somatostatin is produced by neuroendocrine neurons of the periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and exerts antiangiogenic activity against primary tumors and metastasis.

In one embodiment preferred peptides mimicking a structural domain of NOGO receptor where two prominent clusters the acidic and hydrophobic cavities are located include the sequences SEQ ID NOs 27 94 225 228 256 and 257. The cyclo peptides are obtained by cyclization of the terminal Cys residues forming a disulfide bond.

In another embodiment the sequence of these peptides are important for protein protein interactions and with extensive well packed receptor ligand binding interfaces with polar residues linked in complementary electrostatic interactions and thus this region offers unique structures for the binding of substrates and potential inhibitors. These peptides have terminal cys residues that form disulfide bonds via oxidation of SH groups creating compacted cyclic structures. One of the peptides S3 mimics a domain of the C termini region of the PrP protein. Peptides from this group and other related groups are selected to create novel ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds for the potential treatment of spinal cord injury SCI and central nervous system CNS injury where axon regeneration and or neurite outgrowth is required for functional recovery and in the case of somatostain peptides as anti cancer agents.

No. 12 836 187. Each of these applications is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Calcium Dependent Protein Kinase 1 PfCDPK1 UIS3 and Dihydrofolate Reductase Thymidylate Synthase DHFR TS 

Malaria caused by infections is a global health problem affecting 500 million people worldwide annually resulting in about one million deaths per year. Thus the need to develop an effective anti malaria therapeutic vaccine is an unmet medical need.

In one embodiment peptides mimicking short domains of calcium dependent protein kinase 1 PfCDPK1 a protein essential for parasite survival and a domain of UIS3 protein include the sequences SEQ ID NOs 44 and 233 235.

In another embodiment the domains include ATP binding site substrate binding pocket and the calcium binding site. UIS3 protein plays a central role in fatty acid lipid import during the rapid parasite growth in hepatocytes. This protein has an alpha helical structure that binds to one molecule of the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine. The parasite relies on host fatty acids for synthesis of its membranes.

In one additional embodiment Dihydrofolate reductase thymidylate synthase DHFR TS occurs as a bifunctional protein in malaria. The two proteins fuse together to configuration a single polypeptide.

In one embodiment preferred peptides mimicking domains of proteins in the cell wall of gram positive bacteria include the sequences SEQ ID NOs 52 and 240 243.

In another embodiment peptide S1 mimics a domain of the antibacterial activity of human Cystatin C a cysteine protease inhibitor of bacteria containing this protease. Peptide S2 mimics the antibiotic peptide Pep5 derived from . The bactericidal activity of Pep5 is towards gram bacteria such as MRSA and consists of depolarization of energized bacterial cytoplasmic membranes initiated by the formation of aqueous transmembrane pores. This peptide in its natural configuration contains lanthionine amino acids that form thioether bonds with Cys residues to form a cyclic structure. The lanthionine amino acids were replaced by Cys residues which form disulfide bonds via oxidation of SH groups which maintain the ring structure of the peptide further enhancing its stability and resistance to degradation. Peptide S3 forms a ring structure via thioether bonds with Cys residues. The lantibiotic amino acids were replaced with Cys residues to maintain the cyclic structure via disulfide bonds.

Tuberculosis TB is caused by Mtb claiming the lives of millions of people each year and with about one third of the world s population already infected with Mtb. Fatty acid synthesis and their elongation to mycolic acids the hallmark of mycobacterial cell wall is an essential process for bacteria survival. The acyl carrier protein synthase AcpS is a protein comprised of three asymmetric monomers. This protein activates two distinct acyl carrier proteins ACP 1 domain and the mycobacterial AC II protein that are present in fatty acid synthase systems FAS I and FAS II respectively. AcsP binds to ACP 1 and ACPM through different amino acid residues and interactions. The structural characteristics of Mtb AscP protein and the mode of interaction with ACPM and FAS I are essential for Mtb viability thus the protein is a target for the development of drugs. The de novo biosynthetic pathway to pantothenate is present in many bacteria fungi and plants and comprises four enzymes encoded by panB panE panD and panC. This protein and the pantothenate pathway are therefore attractive target for inhibitors that could provide lead compounds for novel anti TB drugs. Since no panF homologues have been identified in Mtb TB cannot acquire pantothenate from the environment. The absence of these enzymes in mammals further suggests that inhibitors could be selective with a reduced risk of side effects.

In one embodiment preferred peptides mimicking functional domains of ACp for CoA binding and the catalytic site of substrates and products important for pantothenate synthetase enzyme catalytic mechanism include the sequences SEQ ID NOs 247 250.

In one more embodiment peptide S1 mimics the site for CoA binding and the site for salt bridge formation as well as the binding interaction sites of ACP II and ACPM proteins. The remaining peptides mimic the catalytic site of substrates and products important for pantothenate synthetase enzyme catalytic mechanism. These peptides are cyclized to enhance their stability and resistance to degradation. Peptides from this and other related groups are selected to create novel ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds for the potential treatment of Mtb infections the causal agent of tuberculosis.

In one additional embodiment all the peptide sequences disclosed in this specification illustrate the advantages of the present invention and are not intended in any way otherwise to limit the scope of the peptides of this invention since any important functional domain of any protein involved directly or indirectly in any disease can be used to select mimicking peptides or motifs of interest to target the protein directly or allosterically and create the multi targeted compound of this invention. In any case the function of the plurality of the stereoisomer peptides in the novel compound is to block interfere or inhibit simultaneously and independently the function of the target protein antagonism or to positively enhance a protein that initiates a response when interacts with another protein e.g. receptor inhibiting the target protein agonism .

In one embodiment any peptide selected as target for a particular target protein is not a natural peptide L peptide but rather a peptide that is synthesized in its stereoisomer form with D amino acids D and rare or unnatural amino acids or D L and rare or unnatural amino acids with retro inverso and inverso configuration and with linear or cyclic compact structure giving rise to alternative stereo chemistries which will be readily appreciated by those of skill in the art.

In other embodiment is worth nothing that natural L peptides in spite of playing a central role in every cell in the body and being effective drugs to target extracellular receptors and have been used to modulate intracellular processes they are inherently unstable within the body are rapidly broken down into inactive fragments by protease enzymes lack the ability to enter cells and are filtered from the blood stream by the kidneys within minutes. Therefore L peptides therapeutic potential is hampered by their rapid degradation in the body and the reason they are not developed as therapeutics. On the other hand the stabilization of peptide analogs such as the stereoisomer peptides and compounds comprising the composition of matter of this invention can be carried out by means of targeted chemical modifications to confer enzymatic resistance to a peptide. Modifications include N terminal acetylation C terminal amidation alkylation of the peptide bond nitrogen cyclization residue side chain modifications change in chirality and replacement of the peptide bond by other chemical groups. Thus peptides containing D and L D L and rare or unnatural amino acids or only D amino acids including changes in their orientation i.e. inverso and retro inverso and with compact cyclic configuration strongly resist enzyme degradation have extended shelf life and lead to higher potency and longer circulation in the body. In addition their changes in chirality do not affect their biological activity. Their stability can be further enhanced by coating or encapsulating a plurality of these peptides with hydrophilic or hydrophobic polymers. The addition of unnatural or rare amino acids raa further enhances the stability of the peptides.

In one more embodiment the stereoisomer peptides containing D and L D L and rare or unnatural amino acids or only D amino acids including all their analogs with different orientations differ in their spatial arrangement of the atoms in their molecule. Peptides with D amino acids are the mirror image of their counterparts with L amino acids. Only peptides with D amino acids or combined with unnatural anibo acids are assembled in both inverso and retro inverso orientations to obtain inverso D peptides and retro inverso D peptides. These enantiomer or stereoisomer peptides can be linear or cyclic and the cyclic stereoisomer peptide may have bridges created by head to tail cyclization by disulfide bonds with two terminal cysteine residues a lactam bridge amide bond formation between the carboxyl group COOH of the side chain of a terminal amino acid and the amino NH group of a side chain of a terminal lysine and thioether bonds formed between a cysteine side chain and the side chain of a serine or a threonine. Thus cyclic peptides have S S C ONH RC ONRor R S R bonds. In this invention any stereoisomer peptide may have a combination of D amino acids and rare amino acids or only D amino acids and the cyclic structure may have any type of bond that has been created by linking terminal residues terminal and core residues or only core residues of the peptide.

In other embodiment rare or unnatural amino acids are selected from the group consisting of Sar Nle Ile Nvl NMe Val NMe Leu NMe Nle Cpg Chg Hyp Oic Igl Aib Aic Pip BhTic BhPro Tiq Nip Thz Thi 4GuaPr 4Pip Idc Bip me Tyr I Tyr Igl BhTic BhPhe AMeF BPhe Phg Anc Atc NMe Phe NMe Lys N hPhe BhTrp pI Phe Aic NMe Lys Orn Dpr 2 Dbu N eMe K N eEt K N eIPr K bhomoK Acm Ahx K NPeg11 K NPeg27 Cit hArg hCit or NMe Arg. They are readily available commercially and can be incorporated during synthesis of the stereoisomer peptides.

In one additional embodiment stereoisomer peptides comprising D amino acids in their retro inverso configuration with cyclic compact structures and their analogs and derivatives have very high stability. This property makes the stereoisomer peptides useful therapeutics for medical applications. Furthermore if a plurality of different specific stereoisomer peptides are conjugated to a biocompatible polymer and further encapsulated inside polymer particles e.g. nanoparticles they are not only held together within the particulated carrier but become even more stable. In addition conjugation of a stereoisomer peptide ligand to the surface of a particulated polymer carrier further enhances the specific delivery of the encapsulated plurality of different stereoisomer peptides to specific tissues cells or cell compartments.

In one more embodiment it is emphasized that both chiral changes and end terminal protection or peptide cyclization creates stereoisomer peptides that are resistant to proteolysis and can readily be conveniently administered by several routes including the oral parenteral topical transdermal or mucosa. Furthermore peptide chirality is not necessarily required for biological activity or for peptide peptide interactions within the membrane environment. Thus they exert their biological activity like their natural counterparts L configurations do. In addition since peptides with D amino acids are not degraded by proteases i.e. resistant to hydrolysis further provides potential for oral bioavailability since they have extended persistence in circulation long shelf life and can be used in harsh mucosal environments including the stomach or as a topical therapeutic.

In one additional embodiment is worth nothing that the body has many peptidases. Thus natural and synthetic peptides with L amino acids completely lack the stereoisomer peptide s properties in vivo. In fact peptidases break peptide bond in L peptides by inserting a water molecule across the bond degrading the L peptides in a manner of a few minutes or less in the body and some peptidases are specific for certain types of L peptides making their degradation even faster. Thus if an L peptide is used as a therapeutic agent its activity is quickly reduced as the L peptide degrades in the body by the action of peptidases rendering the L peptide useless.

In a preferred embodiment stereoisomer peptides have D amino acids in their retro inverso configuration with cyclic compact structures. Their enhanced physicochemical and biological properties make them highly suitable to develop unique and novel stable drugs for therapeutic use. In this invention the novel and unique stable therapeutic is a ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compound.

In one embodiment this invention provides linear stereoisomer peptides with modified N and C terminal group using standard chemistries. Chemically synthesized peptides carry free amino and carboxy terminal groups being electrically charged in general. In order to remove this electric charge to prevent interactions with other peptides and or proteins especially in vivo peptide ends are modified by N terminal acetylation using an acetyl group and or C terminal amidation using an amide group. These modifications mimic a peptide bond at the end of the peptide further increasing their stability to proteases and further yielding enhanced pharmaceutical properties. The N terminal group however is deprotected after synthesis when the peptide is conjugated to a linker that in turn is conjugated to an activated group of a polymer. Furthermore both C and N terminal groups are not protected when the stereoisomer peptide is cyclized. One can also modify the amino and carboxy terminal residues of the stereoisomer peptides to produce derivatives. A wide number of other protecting groups are suitable for this purpose. Particularly preferred carboxyl protecting groups include amides carboxyamidase amidase esters and ether forming protecting groups. Amino protecting groups include acetic acid or halogenated to obtain a derivative thereof.

In another embodiment peptides can also be modified to obtain a derivative thereof such as alpha chloroacetic acid alpha bromoacetic acid or alpha iodoacetic acid or by phosphorylation. Those of skill in the art will recognize that a variety of techniques are available for constructing compounds with the same or similar biological activity but with favorable characteristics in regard to their solubility stability and susceptibility to hydrolysis and proteolysis.

In other embodiment an acetyl group is used to protect the amino terminus and an amide group is used to protect the carboxyl terminus during synthesis. Preferably acetylation is accomplished during the synthesis when the peptide is on the resin using acetic anhydride. These blocking groups also enhance the alpha helix forming of the peptides that have this particular structure. In this invention the stereoisomer peptides are synthesized with protected side chains and protected terminal ends if they are used in their free forms. Stereoisomer peptides that are conjugated to a polymer via a linker however have their amino group unprotected after synthesis to allow for coupling of the amino group of the stereoisomer peptide to the activated ONp paranitrophenyl group of a linker attached to a polymer or the activated carboxyl group of a polymer.

In one embodiment the stereoisomer peptides of the invention refer to an artificial sequence that is synthesized with L D and unnatural amino acids D and unnatural amino acids or with all D amino acids. This gives rise to alternative stereochemistries which will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art. These stereoisomer peptides have two topological configurations represented by inverso D peptides which are the mirror image of L peptides and therefore they do not overlap and by retro inverso D peptides which retain the original spatial orientation of all side chains as in the L peptides. Retroinverso peptides overlap with their L counterparts and are synthesized in the reverse order.

In other embodiment the characterisitics of the compounds provide adequate physichochemical properties given their high stability and resistance to degradation by proteases present in human fluids blood and serum extended persistence in blood and longer shelf life. These physichochemical properties further provide ideal biopharmaceutical properties such as reduction or elimination of immunogenicity administration by the oral or mucosal routes and enhanced biological activity given the high degree of stability.

In one embodiment preferred peptide ligands for use with conjugates of the invention are specific peptides that bind with high affinity to receptors hormones cytokines enzyme substrates viruses proteins and a variety of other macromolecules. The peptide ligand and their analogs may also antagonize or modulate the physiological action of the natural ligands of the macromolecule i.e. proteins directly competitive or indirectly allosteric . Thus they are useful to guide the delivery of drugs to targeted sites. The peptide ligand is a transduction domain peptide e.g. Tat TD a cell penetrating peptide e.g. penetratin a permeation peptide that cross the blood brain or retina barrier a transport peptide e.g. transportan or a chemotactic peptide. Peptides of this type are found in receptors hormones cytokines growth factors kinases and many enzyme substrates and other proteins like chaperons. The antagonistic effect of these peptides may include inhibitory activities. Suitable peptide ligands have inhibitory modulatory and activating functions and include but are not limited to Tat TD transportan penetratin tyrosine kinase antagonists angiogenesis inhibitors apoptosis regulators bFGF inhibitor cartilage derived inhibitor kinase inhibitors IGF 1 receptor inhibitor interferons and their agonists interleukins VEGF ligand lytic peptides MMP inhibitors signal transduction inhibitors signal transduction modulators somatomedin binding proteins splenopentin spongistatin squalamine urokinase GnRH I and II somatostatin transferring melanotropin ApoE Willbrand s factor EGF RGD and CCK peptides heparin plasmin inhibitor platelet factor 4 beta amyloid peptides delta opioid antagonists opiod peptides neuropeptides brain derived peptides chemotactic peptides chemokine peptides antimicrobial peptides TSP 1 receptor pituitary adenylyl cyclase type I bombesin KISS peptides heparin urotensin II peptides octreotide depreotide vapreotide vasoactive intestinal peptide VIP cholecystokinin CCK RGD containing peptides melanocyte stimulating hormone MSH peptide neurotensin calcitonin peptides from complementarily determining regions of an antitumor antibody glutathione YIGSR leukocyte avid peptides e.g. P483H which contain the heparin binding region of platelet factor 4 PF 4 and a lysine rich sequence atrial natriuretic peptide ANP and platelet factor 4 beta amyloid peptides delta opioid antagonists e.g. I TTIPP psi H Tyr 3 I Ticpsi CH2NH Phe Phe OH annexin V endothelin interleuking IL 1 IL 1ra IL 2 and IL 8 leukotriene B4 LTB4 chemotactic peptides e.g. N formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine lysine fMLFK bitistalin pituitary adenylyl cyclase type I receptor PAC1 fibrin chain chemotactic peptides GP IIb IIIa receptor antagonists e.g. DMP444 epidermal growth factor human neutrophil elastase inhibitor e.g. EPI HNE 2 and EPI HNE 4 plasmin inhibitor antimicrobial peptides apticide e.g. P280 and P274 thrombospondin receptor and TP 1300 analogs pituitary adenylyl cyclase type I and those derived from phage display libraries and their substitutions. The peptide ligand of this invention is also a stereoisomer peptide.

In one embodiment the peptides of the invention may be prepared by classical chemical synthesis methods. Solid phase synthesis is typically commenced from the C terminal end of the peptide using an alpha amino protected resin. After initial coupling the alpha amino protecting group is removed using trifluoroacetic acid TFA or hydrochloric acid HCl solutions in organic solvents at room temperature. Thereafter alpha amino protected amino acids are successively coupled to a growing support bound peptide chain. The alpha amino protecting groups including protection of side chains are those known to be useful in stepwise synthesis of peptides and include a variety of protecting groups well known in the art. After the desired amino acid sequence has been completed the desired peptide is decoupled from the resin support by treatment with a reagent such as trifluoroacetic acid TFA or hydrogen fluoride HF which not only cleaves the peptide from the resin but also cleaves all remaining side chain protecting groups.

In another embodiment the chemical synthesis of peptides with D amino acids is similar to the synthesis of peptides with L amino acids. The purification process is carried out using standard HPLC or by dialysis. D amino acids with L and or unnatural amino acids or only D amino acids are incorporated at one or more positions in the peptide simply by using a D configuration or an unnatural derivatized amino acid residue in the chemical synthesis. D amino acid residues and unnatural amino acids for solid phase peptide synthesis are commercially available from a number of suppliers. The D and unnatural amino acids or only D amino acids are incorporated at any position in the peptide to obtain the desired stereoisomer peptide.

In a preferred embodiment retro inverso peptides contain only D amino acids assembled in the reverse order of their parent L sequences. These peptides have the properties of retaining the protein bioactivity are long lasting proteolitically and share the antigenic mimicry of their L counterparts. Essentially retroinverso peptides are a structural mimic of the parent peptide and are immune to proteolytic attack since the peptide is entirely stable in human plasma serum and tissue.

In another preferred embodiment retroinverso peptides are synthesized using the same methods to synthesize their L counterparts however there are many variations and the variation in the method depend on the type of modifications group protection and or the addition of unnatural amino acids in the sequence of the D peptide and its orientation. For example one synthesis approach is to create a malonate derivative using tert butoxycarbonyl Boc chemistry on a p methylbenzhydralamine resin. Assembling of the protective peptide chain can be carried out at the 100 mmolscale using a neutralization protocol. The R S 2 isobutylmalonic acid monobenzyl ester is incorporated in the peptide chain as a recemate generating a pair of diastereoisomers. The peptide is cleaved from the resin with HF anhydrous hydrogen fluoride in the presence of anisole and 1 2 ethanedithiol. The HF is removed in vacuo the crude peptide is eluted from the resin lyophilized and purified by preparative HPLC and identified according to the retention time. The purity of the retroinverso peptides 85 is assessed by analytical HPLC using a TFA gradient in acetonitrile and its identity is determined by MALDI MS matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry . Amino acid analysis is carried out to determine the content of the synthetic peptide.

In one embodiment retroinverso peptides can be synthesized employing isocyanates of Na Fmoc amino acids peptide acids catalyzed by DMAP. In a typical reaction Fmoc amino acid azides are prepared by generating a mixed anhydride of Fmoc amino acid and then reacted with NaN. The resulting azide is then dissolved in toluene and subjected to Curtius rearrangement. After evaporation of toluene under reduced pressure the azide is dissolved in DCM and a mixture of Boc Z Bsmocamino acid and a catalytic amount of DMAP are added at 0 C. with a 30 min stirring followed by stirring for additional 2 hours at RT. The product is then isolated by recrystallization generating high yields 70 92 . This method can also be applied to Fmoc peptide acids and the entire course of the reaction can be completed in about 4 hours. The retro inverso peptides are isolated by recrystallization and then characterized by mass spectroscopic measurements and other techniques like 1H NMR 13C NMR and amino acid analysis.

In a preferred embodiment the synthesis of retro inverso peptides is carried out using standard solid phase synthesis methods but with D isomers and or unnatural aminoacids. At the N terminus a lysine may be added for later use i.e. conjugation to a polymer and the epsilon amine group is protected by acetylation. Once peptide synthesis is complete the N terminal Fmoc group is removed to uncover the N terminal amine and the protected peptide containing a C terminal carboxyl is cleaved from the Cl trt resin see Example 1 .

In another preferred embodiment the peptide fragments containing the free N terminal amine and C terminal carboxyl are cyclized head to tail to obtain the constrained cyclic structure of the peptide The cyclo peptide is then cleaved from the resin and purified using preparative HPLC columns. Fractions that meet purity requirements are lyophilized and stored at 80 C. Amino acid analysis is utilized to determine the net amount of the peptide and the purified peptide is converted to the acetate salt lyophilization and storage until used see Example 1 .

In one embodiment some of the amino acid sequences selected have linear structure forming a combination of H helix beta sheet and C coil structure which negative or positive charge and with only a few hydrophobic residues. In this case the short sequence may specifically target a substrate site or the binding pocket of a substrate and the Cys residues when present may not necessarily form disulfide bonds. Peptides with alpha helix have a net positive charge and a percentage of the hydrophobic residues located on one side of the chain with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids forming an amphipathic helix. Proteins with helices usually have a modulating activity like human cathelicidin and bacterial Gramicidin A.

In a preferred embodiment the peptides with amino acids arranged in the alpha helix configuration have the property to bind and permeate the negatively charged membranes and therefore are useful as therapeutics since they readily penetrate cell membranes. Peptides with similar configuration but containing stereoisomer amino acids are designed from the protein of interest to enhance their therapeutic properties. Although these peptides are linear only those with alpha helix require maintaining the original linear structure in order to retain their biological activity. However peptides with both alpha helix and beta sheet can be cyclized to stabilize the chains specially the alpha helix increasing their stability and without losing their biological activity. This approach makes these peptides even more valuable for pharmaceutical and therapeutic purposes.

In one embodiment disulfide bridges are an important subject matter of this invention since the stereoisomer peptides may contain one two or three intramolecular disulfide bonds that are formed by oxidation of the Cys residues by pairing the desired Cys residues through the SH groups present in the sequence of a particular synthetic stereoisomer peptide. The control of Cys bond formation is exercised by choosing an oxidizing agent of the type and concentration effective to optimize formation of the desired disulfide bond especially when the peptide has more than 2 Cys residues. In general oxidation is carried out chemically using a catalyst see Example 2 .

In another embodiment cyclization by disulfide bond of highly purified stereoisomer peptides whose purification has been validated by HPLC and ESI MS or MALDI TOF can be carried out using either ferricyanide assisted cyclization or glutathione assisted oxidation reactions.

In one additional embodiment the rigidity of the cyclic peptide depends upon the number of disulfide bonds which is determined by the number of Cys residues present in the peptide chain 2 4 or 6 creating single double or triple intra molecular disulfide bonds via oxidation of their SH groups to obtain cyclic constrained structures. The higher the number of Cys residues in the peptide the more compact is the structure. This property makes the cyclo peptides highly stable and therefore potentially affecting the function folding or interaction of the target protein with high affinities.

In one embodiment other non disulfide peptide cyclization strategies are employed especially when cyclization is carried out with residues that are not Cys residues. The cyclization of peptides is achieved by the covalent chemical bond formed between the terminal amino acids of the peptide where the carboxyl group termini of one amino acid reacts with the amino group termini of the other amino acid causing the release of a molecule of water and creating an amide bond. This linking is also known as head to tail linking of the terminal amino acids creating the amide bond also known as peptide bond. It is advantageous also to incorporate a Lys residue to the cyclized peptide to conjugate the preferred polymer to the available group of the Lys residue.

In another embodiment cyclization of peptides can also be carried out by lactam bond formation which is also an amide bond. This bond is created between the side chain of the amino acid lysine with the side chain of the amino acids glutamate or aspartate. The amide and lactam bonds are important structural features to cyclize peptides to stabilize alpha helices or to substitute for the less stable disulfide bonds. Cyclo peptides created in this manner also have the molecular rigidity necessary to enhance their physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties.

In one additional embodiment the peptides may have in their core sequence Cys residues that are cyclized by replacing one Cys residue with lysine and the second Cys residue with glutamic acid. Thereafter a cyclic peptide may be formed through an amide bond i.e. lactam bond between the side chains of these two residues. Alternatively a peptide may be synthesized wherein one Cys of the core sequence is replaced with lysine or serine. A cyclic peptide may then be formed through a thio ether linkage between the side chains of the lysine or serine residue and the second Cys residue of the core sequence. As such in addition to disulfide cyclization strategies amide and thio ether cyclization strategies can be readily used to cyclize the stereoisomer peptides. Alternatively the amino terminus of the stereoisomer peptide can be capped with an alpha substituted acetic acid wherein the substituent is a cleaving group such as an alpha haloacetic acid for example alpha chloroacetic acid alpha bromoacetic acid or alpha iodoacetic acid.

In one more embodiment cyclization of helical peptides is done directly by head to tail or by creating small cycles adjacent to amino acids of interest. For example if the residues form an alpha helix the helical structure can be stabilized by creating a cyclic peptide by linking the N group of one terminal residue with the C group of the other terminal residue creating a peptide bond. If the peptide has a small motif with alpha helix structure this chain can be stabilized by cyclizing the side chains of adjacent amino acids near the motif of interest creating a lactam bond. In both cases an amide bond is created. Another method to stabilize helices in peptide chains is to incorporate a short ethylene glycol based linker e.g. N Fmoc 8 amino 3 6 dioxaoctyl succinamic acid that results in a conformational change of the peptide from random coil to an alpha helix.

In one embodiment cyclic or linear stereoisomer peptides may be coupled to a linker during synthesis or the linker may be coupled to a single polymer chain or to a branch of a polymer via conjugation. A linker conjugated to an activated group of a single polymer chain or a branch of a polymer is useful to determine the cellular transport clearance cleavage or release of the linked stereoisomer peptide in the target tissue cell or sub cellular location and can serve as initiation site that enables binding to one or more other molecular moieties. The addition of linkers is achieved by synthesis methods well established in the art. The linker may contain two or more amino acids preferably selected from D Lys D Gly D Phe D Leu D Ser D Tyr D Glu D Gln and D Asn. The selected residues are preferably D amino acids and have groups suitable for attachment to the target functional groups of a polymer either pre activated or in the presence of a suitable coupling reagent. The linker may contain between 2 to 5 amino acids and the functional group of a terminal amino acid may be reacted with the target single branch or multiple branches of the pre activated polymer. In the case of Lys the functional amino group reacts with the pre activated polymer to attach the linker which is subsequently used to attach a linear or a cyclic peptide by covalent bond creating an amide link.

In one embodiment polymers are used to create compounds to deliver drugs to tissues cells or cellular compartments i.e. cytosol . The polymer is selected from a group consisting of polylactide polyglycolic acid PGA polylactic acid PLA polyhydroxy acids PHAs poly lactic co glycolic acid PLGA polyethylene Glycol PEG and branched PEG polyvinyl acetate polyvinyl alcohol poly N hydroxyetheyl DL aspartamide PHEA poly N hydroxypropyl DL aspartamide PHPA poly N 2 Hydroxypropyl methacrylamide HPMA and HPMA copolymers polyethylenimine PEI polylysine poly aspartic acid poly L lysine poly L glutamic acid L Phenylalanine based poly ester amide s Tyrosine derived polycarbonate L Tyrosine polyphosphate Poly L lactide b g benzyl glutamate Poly ester imide s incorporating L alanine Poly amide imide s using L lysine L methionine based poly ester amide s L Arginine based poly ester amide s L Phenylalanine based poly ester amide s L Alanine based poly ester amide s L Valine based poly ester amide s L Leucine based poly ester amide s L Isoleucine based poly ester amide s L Norleucine based poly ester amide s D L methionine based poly ester amide s Poly butylenes adipate a Hydroxy acids derived from amino acids and combined with glycolic acid lactic acid and 6 hydroxyhexanoic acid Copoly amino acid s based on 6 aminocaproic acid and L proline poly ether ester amide s 4 hydroxyproline Z Lys 8 benzyloxycarbonyl L lysine L Glu OBzl benzyl L glutamic acid benzyloxycarbonyl L cysteine benzyl L aspartic acid methoxybenzyl L cysteine O benzyl L serine PLAL poly LLA co Lys poly N isopropylacrylamide poly R N 2 hydroxyethyl L aspartamide poly DLLA co 4 hydroxyl L proline poly ester amide poly ether ester amide poly ester amide with unsaturated backbone poly ester co urethane poly caprolactone poly alkyl cyanoacrylates poly isobutylcyanoacrylate ethyl cellulose cellulose acetate phthalate polyvinyl alcohol Poly styrene Poly vinylpyridine Poly hydroxybutyrate poly butylcyanoacrylate Poly alkyl methacrylate poly fumaric anhydre poly lactide co glycolide sodium alginate double coated nanoparticles tween 80 and PEG 20000 poly butylcyanoacrylate Pluronic polymeric micelles and the natural polymers albumin casein gelatin alginate collagen chitosan and derivatives thereof. PLGA PLA and Poly caprolactone are FDA approved polymers.

In another embodiment polylactide and poly lactic co glycolic acid PLGA are typically used to provide sustained drug delivery for a determined period of time. Poly lactic acid and polyethylene glycol are suitable for controlled parenteral drug delivery system. Other delivery systems that are used may include liposome based drug delivery carriers nano particles based on di stearoyl phosphatidyl choline DSPC cholesterol dioleoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine DOPE and di stearoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine DSPE mPEG2000 conjugated to the target molecule.

In a preferred embodiment the polymers to create the compounds of this invention are poly lactic co glycolic acid PLGA polylactic acid PLA Poly caprolactone N 2 Hydroxypropyl methacrylamide HPMA HPMA co monomers Pluronic polymeric micelles PPM and polyethylene Glycol PEG . Each different stereoisomer peptide from a plurality of stereoisomer peptides and a peptide ligand are independently and separately conjugated to a functional group of a single polymer chain or to a separate branch of the polymer either directly or via cleavable or no cleavable linkers respectively depending on the polymer and then conjugated all together by polymerization or by encapsulation in the polymer to create novel ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds. These compounds created for the first time can be formulated for different administration routes and used in the anti diseases strategies described here.

In one embodiment this specification provides for the first time novel therapeutic compounds for treating a variety of diseases utilizing specific ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds. Thus any disease state amenable to treatment with the compounds is addressed by providing novel therapeutic compounds as shown in this specification.

In another embodiment a biodegradable polymer i.e. PLGA is capable of being cleaved into biocompatible byproducts through chemical or enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis in the body. This biodegradable property is what makes possible to use them conjugated to stereoisomer peptides since they do not accumulate in the body. If the polymer is not biodegradable i.e. HPMA it can be excreted via the urine as long as their molecular weight does not exceed the glomerular size to allow their body excretion from the kidney to the urine and out from the body. Another advantage is that stereoisomer peptides conjugated to hydrophilic or hydrophobic and degradable and or biocompatible polymers can be released in a controlled manner i.e. the stereoisomer peptide concentration in the target site tissues or cells is maintained within the therapeutic window. The release rates of the stereoisomer peptides from polymers can be controlled by a number of factors such as biodegradation degradation of linkers in the case of non biodegradable polymers the kinetic of the polymers. In this particular invention the high stability of the stereoisomer peptides allow longer retention time of the stereoisomer peptides in the body.

In one embodiment compounds of the formula sP n L Pol P named ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugates compounds for potential use as therapeutics for the treatment of a variety of human diseases are polymer based compounds. The polymer is selected from the group comprising poly lactic co glycolic acid PLGA polylactide Acid PLA Poly caprolactone PLC poly N 2 Hydroxypropyl methacrylamide HPMA HPMA co monomers Pluronic polymeric micelles PPM and polyethylene glycol PEG . In this invention the preparation of such conjugates including their encapsulation in nanoparticles of a polymer carrying a peptide ligand conjugated on the surface of the polymer nanoparticles for targeted delivery is exemplified with the polymers PLGA and HPMA as described in the proceeding sections of this specification.

In one embodiment to illustrate this invention poly lactic co glycolic acid PLGA a biodegradable and biocompatible FDA approved polymer e.i. co monomer is used to create a PLGA conjugate compound. PLGA is synthesized by random ring opening co polymerization of the monomers glycolic acid and lactic acid to create PLGA. This polymer is readily dissolved compared to their monomers by a wide range of common solvents including acetone ethyl acetate chlorinated solvents and tetrahydrofuran.

In other embodiment degradation of PLGA occurs by hydrolysis of its ester linkages in the presence of water and depends on the monomers ratio used in production. The higher the content of glycolide units the lower the time required for degradation. A PLGA copolymer with 50 50 monomers ratio has the faster degradation time of about two months. The polymer degradation time can also be tailored by altering the ratio of lactic acid and glycolic acid during synthesis. This is important for the manufacturing nanoparticles. PLGA polymers that are end capped with esters as opposed to the free carboxylic acid have longer degradation half lives. In this invention the carboxylic group is activated to conjugate the stereoisomer peptide forming an amide bond hence its degradation is not altered since there is no free carboxylic group available.

In one more embodiment PLGA degrades in vivo by hydrolysis into alpha hydroxy acids i.e. the original monomers lactic acid and glycolic acid . Since the human body effectively degrades the monomers there is minimal to none systemic toxicity associated with using PLGA polymers. Under normal physiological conditions these two monomers are by products of various metabolic pathways in the body e.g. TCA cycle hence PLGA was approved by the FDA in 1976 and has been used since then to deliver drugs for example against prostate cancer.

In one embodiment solvent evaporation and solvent extraction processes are carried out by a single emulsion process or by double multiple emulsion process. The single emulsion process consists in a process where oil in water o w is used for the emulsification. PLGA is dissolved in water immiscible and volatile dichloromethane DCM followed by addition of the drug to produce a solution or dispersion of the drug particles. This polymer solvent drug solution dispersion is emulsified by stirring at an appropriate temperature in a large volume of water containing poly vinyl alcohol PVA to yield the oil water emulsion. This emulsion is then subjected to solvent removal to harden the oil droplets. Solvent removal is carried out by evaporation with reduced pressure or at atmospheric pressure with reduced stir rate and slowly to prevent the formation of porous particles or by extraction by transferring the emulsion into a large volume of water with or w o surfactant or a quenching medium into which the solvent in the oil droplets is diffused out. The later is simpler and faster and do not form porous particles. The solid microspheres are then washed and collected by filtration sieving or centrifugation and dried under appropriate conditions or lyophilized to obtain the final free microsphere product. Unfortunately this method yields poor encapsulation efficiencies since hydrophilic drugs i.e. peptides diffuses out or partitions from the dispersed oil phase into the aqueous phase and the drug gets dispersed in the surface of the polymer matrix causing a rapid release of the peptide burst effect hence this method is more appropriate to encapsulate steroids rather than hydrophilic drugs.

In another embodiment the oil in oil emulsification method consists essentially in solubilizing PLGA and the drug in acetonitrile. This solution is then dispersed in light mineral oil in the presence of surfactant e.g. Span to obtain the oil in oil emulsion also known as water in oil. The microspheres are then obtained by evaporation or extraction of the organic solvent and the oil is washed off with n hexane. This method is preferred for insoluble drugs.

In one more embodiment the method of phase separation known also as coacervation is also used to encapsulate peptides. It consists of decreasing the solubility of the encapsulating polymer by addition of a third component to the polymer solution in an organic solution the process yields two liquid phases the polymer containing coacervate phase and the supernatant phase depleted in polymer. The peptide which is dispersed or dissolved in the polymer solution is coated by the coacervate which essentially includes three defined steps which are the phase separation of the coating polymer solution adsorption of the coacervate around the drug particles and solidification of the microspheres. The polymer is dissolved in an organic solution and the stereoisomer peptide is dissolved in water and dispersed in the polymer solution water oil emulsion . An organic nonsolvent is then added to the polymer stereoisomer peptide solvent system with stifling which gradually extracts the polymer solvent. The polymer is subjected to phase separation and it forms very soft coacervate droplets which entrap the stereoisomer peptide. The particle size is controlled by stirring. This system is then transferred to a large quantity of a nonsolvent organic to harden the micro droplets and form the final microspheres which are collected by washing sieving filtration or centrifugation and dried.

In a preferred embodiment the double emulsion process water in oil in water w o w is used. Briefly the stereoisomer peptide and a solution of PLGA is mixed and stirred to form the microemulsion in which water containing PVP is added to obtain the emulsion see Example 5 .

In other preferred embodiment the spray drying method is used given its speed convenience easiness to scale up under mild conditions and does not depend on the solubility parameter of the drug and the polymer. This process requires a double nozzle spray drying technique in the presence of an anti adherent. This method produces microspheres with high yield and encapsulation ratio compared to those prepared with the double emulsion method see Example 5 .

In one more preferred embodiment low temperature spraying method for preparing PLGA is used to increase the efficiency of encapsulation and drug retention. This process increases the microspheres encapsulation efficiencies above 95 see Example 5 .

In other embodiment the PLGA polymer particles loaded with a plurality of different stereoisomer peptides are prepared using a variation of the mulsion method. Briefly the different stereoisomer peptides are dissolved in a 1 aqueous solution and added to a 2 solution of PLGA in DM ClCH by fast vortexing to obtain an emulsion which is then mixed with the aqueous phase of PF 68 at 1 the emulsion is sonicated at 140 w and 20 kHz for 2 minutes to create the nanoparticles. The organic solvent is evaporated overnight with continuous stifling and the nanoparticles rinsed at least four times in DI water by ultracentifugation at 40 000 rpm for one hour at 4 C. followed by lyophilization in a solution of 5 sucrose using a condenser at low temperature 55 C. under low pressure 

Alternatively the emulsion can be prepared with peptides and PLGA 504H 1 2.3 mixed in DM at RT with a stirrer. The organic phase is injected with a syringe into 75 mL of an aqueous polyvinyl alcohol PVA but preferably PVP reduce burst effect solution and homogenized at 24K rpm for 5 minutes. The emulsion is sonicated 2 minutes at 30 W . The resulting nanoemulsion is maintained under gentle mixing for 4 hours to evaporate off the organic solvent. The nanoparticles are collected by centrifugation at 20K rpm 20 min washed 3 times with DI water and the nanoparticle dispersion is freeze dried 40 C. for 48 hours to obtain a fine powder.

In one more embodiment oil and water or oil oil is used. In the oil water emulsion 20 mg of phospholipid lecithin is added to the water phase followed by the nanoparticles preparation as described above in the oil oil emulsion the peptide and PLGA 1 5 are added to acetonitrile which is added into viscous liquid paraffin containing Span 80 under continuous stifling to obtain a finely dispersed drug suspension. The suspension is heated to 55 C. and stirred for 2 hours to ensure complete evaporation of acetonitrile. The collection washing and nanoparticle freeze dried procedures are carried out as described above.

In a preferred embodiment appropriate characterization of the encapsulated nanoparticles loaded with different stereoisomer peptides or the stereoisomer peptide ligand includes i particle size determination using a particle size analyzer ii encapsulation efficiency by centrifugation and UV readings and iii drug release in vitro studies in PBS at 37 C. with continuous stirring followed by the analysis of aliquots taken at a predetermined interval to measure the amount of released peptide by UV spectrometry using standard control curves.

In a preferred embodiment the encapsulation of stereoisomer peptides entails the formation of nanoparticles the preferred particle size of this invention. Since there is need to direct the drug to target tissues via systemic circulation or across the mucosa it is necessary therefore to administer particles less than 500 nm to be able to cross the cell membrane. Nanoparticles nanospheres and nanocapsules can thus be prepared by the same methods but adjusting the manufacturing parameters to obtain nanometer size droplets.

In other preferred embodiment each different stereoisomer peptide sP and the peptide ligand P are directly conjugated to activated PLGA co monomer in separate reactions. Activated PLGA is reacted with the free amino group present in the linear stereoisomer peptide or with the deprotected 8 amino group of the Lys residue for cyclic stereoisomer peptides. This reaction is shown in detail in and Example 3. This procedure allows the conjugation of each different stereoisomer peptide and the peptide ligand with PLGA allowing firm holding and extended release of the stereoisomer peptide rather than encapsulating a plurality of different stereoisomer peptides in free form.

In one more preferred embodiment the resulting products are PLGA monomers conjugated with stereoisomer peptide and PLGA monomers conjugated with stereoisomer peptide ligand. The former creates a plurality of different PLGA stereoisomer peptide conjugates the latter creates a single specific PLGA peptide ligand conjugate. This specific PLGA peptide ligand conjugate is then used to encapsulate the plurality of PLGA stereoisomer peptide conjugates with polymer nanoparticles see below . Thus the peptides are not in free from but conjugated with PLGA and this plurality of conjugates are inside PLGA nanoparticles see and Example 5 . This allows longer retention times elimination of the burst effect and better encapsulation efficiency.

In other preferred embodiment the encapsulation of stereoisomer peptides conjugated with PLGA is carried out with a plurality of different stereoisomer peptides that have been conjugated each separately with PLGA following the methods described in the preceding pages and Example 5. This approach has the purpose of creating PLGA nanoparticles loaded with PLGA conjugated with stereoisomer peptides with the purpose of increasing the stability and better retention of the peptide in the particles allowing longer periods of time for the peptides to be released in the target site and obtaining a higher efficiency of encapsulation. In this invention the preferred method is the double emulsion process water in oil in water w o w with the low temperature spraying method to prepare the loaded PLGA nanoparticles since this method best fit the stereoisomer peptides of this invention. The final product is a novel multi stereoisomer peptide PLGA conjugate compound.

In one embodiment water soluble polymer HPMA is used as a carrier for the stereoisomer peptides to create stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds. The polymer selectivity is due to the manner polymer containing compositions enter cells which is through receptor mediated endocytosis. The polymer body distribution delivers drugs passively due to the enhanced permeability and retention EPR effect.

In other embodiment attachment of stereoisomer peptides to HPMA provides ideal pharmaceutical properties for the peptides since HPMA N 2 Hydroxypropyl methacrylamide is a hydrophilic and biocompatible polymer and their copolymers are of great value as platform for delivery of such peptides. Conjugation of any of the stereoisomer peptides disclosed in this invention to HPMA in their synthetically and chemically modified forms will result in novel HPMA polymer conjugates carrying a specific stereoisomer peptides and a peptide ligand for targeted delivery. Furthermore conjugation of a plurality of stereoisomer peptides to the polymer allows the creation of novel ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide HPMA conjugate compounds. Since the peptides have sequences that target specific domains of disease proteins or anti nagiogenic proteins the novel compounds created here are also quite suitable for any of the anti disease strategies disclosed in this invention.

In one additional embodiment the polymer N 2 Hydroxypropyl methacrylamide HPMA is a biocompatible linear scaffold polymer carrier with separate branches where individual molecules e.g. stereoisomer peptides can be conjugated to functional groups of a polymer branch. The function of the HPMA polymer is to deliver the stereoisomer peptides to targeted tissues cells and sub cellular locations.

After addition of MACl and NAOH the reaction mixture is brought to room temperature and allowed to react for 1 hour at pH between 6 and 7. The dichloromethane layer is separated from the water layer washed with 2 ml of water and discarded. The aqueous layer together with the washings was mixed with 40 ml of EtOAc. HCl is then added slowly under vigorous stirring and cooling until pH 2 3 is reached. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted three times 3 20 ml and then dried overnight over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The dried solution is filtered and washed with EtOAc. The EtOAc was removed by rotary evaporation to obtain a white powder product which is then re crystallized from EtOAc. Synthesis of MA Gly Gly OH is carried out with the same method except that Gly is used instead of Phe residue.

The reaction mixture is concentrated under vacuum to evaporate methanol 160 ml water are added and the mixture is acidified with concentrated citric acid to pH 2.0. The free acid is extracted with EtOAc 4 200 ml washed with a salt saturated solution and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate overnight. After evaporation of the solvent under vacuum the product is re crystallized from EtOAc. Synthesis of MA GG OH is carried out with the same methods except that MA GG OMe is used.

In one embodiment synthesis of MA GFLG ONp is carried out by adding to a solution of MA GFLG OH 4.7 g 10 mmol in 80 ml of DMF a solution of 1.67 g of p nitrophenol 12 mmol in 20 ml of DMF under stirring and cooling to 10 C. followed by a solution of 2.5 g of DCC 12 mmol in 8 ml of DMF. The reaction mixture is stirred for six hours at 10 C. and then overnight at 4 C. The precipitated byproduct DCU is filtered off and the DMF removed by rotary evaporation. The residue is dissolved in EtOAc and the remaining byproduct is filtered off. EtOAc is evaporated to dryness. The final product is soaked in ether to remove excess p nitrophenol. This procedure is repeated several times and the purity of MA GFLG ONp is checked by calculating the extinction coefficient in DMSO. MA GFLG ONp content is assessed by release of p nitrophenol ONp from the polymer in 1.0 N NaOH by UV spectrophotometry 400 nm . Synthesis of MA GG ONp is carried out with the same method except that MA GG OH is used.

In one embodiment synthesis of polymer precursor HPMA MA GFLG ONp and HPMA MA GG ONp is carried out separately by radical polymerization of the corresponding monomers HPMA and MA GFLG ONp and HPMA and MA GG ONp respectively. These copolymers are analyzed by size exclusion chromatography. The content of ONp groups is determined by UV vis spectrophotometry. Briefly polymerization is carried out using a mixture of HPMA MA GFLG ONp and MA GG ONp at various molar ratios using the initiator 2 2 azobisisobutironitrile AIBN . The solution containing the monomers in desired molar ratios dissolved in acetone and mixed with the initiator is transferred to an ampoule and bubbled with nitrogen for 5 min sealed and placed in an oil bath at 50 C. for 24 hours under stirring. After 24 hours the copolymers would precipitate out of solution and the ampoules are cooled to room temperature and placed in the freezer for 20 minutes to increase the yield of the precipitated polymer further.

For detail of the synthesis of the stereoisomer peptides and stereoisomer peptide ligand to HPMA monomer and co monomers and the creation of the final product a ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide HPMA conjugate compound see Examples 7 8 9 and 10.

In another embodiment the pre activated copolymer HPMA GFLG ONp is also commercially available allowing the reduction of several synthesis steps. The direct coupling of the amine group of a stereoisomer peptide to the pre activated copolymer HPMA GFLG ONp in separate reactions for each different stereoisomer peptide followed by copolymerization all together with the monomer MA GG PL the ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide HPMA conjugate of the form HPMA GFLG D peptide 3 GG Pis created.

In one additional embodiment the molecular weight of the branched polymer precursor and the polymer conjugate is approximately 30 to 50 KDa with about 30 KDa for the precursor and about 45 KDa for the conjugate. The term about indicates that in preparations of hydrophilic HPMA some molecules will weigh more some less than the stated molecular weight. The final molecular weight will depend on the polymerization reaction that determines the number of branches desired in the polymer the size of the peptide ligand and the target specific stereoisomer peptides conjugated to HPMA copolymer pre activated precursor which can be determined by gel filtration chromatography and the peptide content in the conjugate can be determined by amino acid analysis.

In one more embodiment the synthesis of ligand targeted polymer conjugates carrying each a single stereoisomer peptide and the targeted stereoisomer peptide ligand P with or without a linker are referred in this invention as stereoisomer peptide HPMA conjugate compounds and constitute a subject matter of this invention. These conjugate compounds can be evaluated using in vitro and in vivo assays to determine the ability of each specific stereoisomer peptide to compete bind block or inhibit a functional group of the corresponding target protein.

In still another embodiment the synthesis of ligand targeted polymer conjugates carrying each more than one different stereoisomer peptide and the targeted stereoisomer peptide ligand P with or without a linker are referred in this invention as multi stereoisomer peptide HPMA conjugate compounds and constitute also the subject matter of this invention. These multi peptide polymer conjugates can be synthesized by mixing more than one stereoisomer peptide and the stereoisomer peptide ligand P in the reaction mixture to generate polymer conjugates containing randomly distributed stereoisomer peptides with different sequences and the stereoisomer peptide ligand P. However this approach may provide heterogeneous amounts of the different stereoisomer peptides therefore to generate multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugates with homogeneous amount of each peptide the monomers carrying the stereoisomer peptides and the stereoisomer peptide ligand are preferably synthesized separately and then polymerized radical polymerization to create the final targeted polymer with different stereoisomer peptides and the peptide ligand P.

In one additional embodiment it is also desirable to synthesize separately for example three different polymer conjugates two carrying each a different stereoisomer peptide and one carrying the stereoisomer peptide ligand. These individual conjugates are purified and then mixed in equivalent molar ratios. These mixtures of polymer conjugates carrying different stereoisomer peptides and peptide ligand are also referred in this invention as multi stereoisomer peptide HPMA conjugate compounds since the mixture comprises different stereoisomer peptides.

In one embodiment the peptides in the form of stereoisomer peptides in retroinverso and or inverso and linear or cyclic configurations but preferably with retroinverso and cyclic configurations are useful in assays in vitro to determine their inhibitory activities IC in different human endothelial and cancer cell lines and other human cells and in strains of a desired target pathogen. In the preferred practice of the present invention two or more different synthetic stereoisomer peptides are conjugated to a polymer system such as PLGA or HPMA. This stereoisomer peptide polymer combination system creates novel synthetic ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds. These polymer conjugates are compounds that provide benefits over non conjugated polymers such as improved solubility and in vivo stability. These conjugates can be used to determine the polymer s transport properties efficiency of internalization permeability and retention and biodistribution in vitro in certain human cells or in vivo in a particular disease animal model or its binding or internalization in different viral or bacterial cells. The stereoisomer peptides conjugated to the polymer have the potential to block or inhibit functional domains of corresponding target proteins. By labeling such compounds with Tc or Y or by using fluorescent molecules such as Cy5 and Eu one can identify cells having the compounds on their surfaces or in subcellular locations using fluorescent imaging. In addition the stereoisomer peptides and the conjugates can be used in Western blotting ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay FACS analysis based on their ability to bind specifically to the target proteins or cells the stereoisomer peptides may also be used in purifying cells expressing a particular microorganism protein on the cell surface or inside the cells.

In other embodiment the specific inhibitory activities of the stereoisomer peptides in free form or conjugated to a polymer as described in this specification can be further tested against the corresponding target proteins using appropriate in vitro assays and in vivo animal models. A variety of commercially available disease models can also be used to experimentally studying the compounds against a particular target protein in vivo. For example animal models include but are not limited to mouse models for macular degeneration for breast pancreatic melanoma and a variety of other cancers for multiple sclerosis and neuropathies to name a few. Finally the description provides a large group of peptides from which peptides of interest can be selected to synthesize the stereoisomr peptides prepare the compounds of the invention and test them in vivo for their inhibitory activities against a specific target protein.

In another embodiment the stereoisomer peptides in free from are useful as commercial reagents for various research and diagnostic applications including the preparation of antibodies or antigen antibody binding and complexes formation using commercially available pathogen or proteins antibodies. They could also be used as blocking reagents in random peptide screening aimed to find new antigens that target a specific causing disease protein or an uncommon microorganism strain or to raise antibodies specific for a particular protein of human or microorganisms.

In one embodiment the invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising formulated linear and cyclic stereoisomer peptide compounds and ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds. The compounds may be prepared for administration by oral ocular transmucosal nasal vaginal rectal or sublingual parenteral intramuscular i.m intraperitoneal i.p. intravenous i.v. intra cardiac i.c. and subcutaneous s.c. topical transdermal passively and pulmonary routes and may be formulated in dosage configurations appropriate for each route of administration using pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Procedures to prepare pharmaceutical compositions and their solid dosage configurations are well known in the art see Martin E W 1990 Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences. 8th Ed. Mack Publishing Co. Easton Pa. 18042 and Marshall K 1979 In Modern Pharmaceutics Edited by G. S. Banker and C. T. Rhodes Chapter 10 197 herein incorporated by reference.

In other embodiment the pharmaceutical compositions comprise effective amounts of a stereoisomer peptide a mixture of stereoisomer peptides or stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugates together with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents solubilizers emulsifiers preservatives adjuvants and or carriers. Such compositions may include diluents of various buffer content pH and ionic strength additives such as detergents and solubilizing agents anti oxidants preservatives and bulking substances and the compositions may be prepared in liquid configuration or in dried powder configuration.

In preferred embodiments the compounds of this invention are synthetic stereoisomer peptides which unlike typical peptide formulations with L peptides have the advantage of being stable and not being degraded by proteases which are pharmaceutical properties for oral bioavailability or for administration in harsh environments via the mucosa. Natural peptides with L do not allow such routes of administration due to fast degradation. In particular cyclic stereoisomer peptides containing only D amino acids are effective therapeutics due to enhanced stability. Thus they can be orally administered to a mammal and be readily taken up and delivered to the serum. These modifications facilitate their uptake in the blood stream from the digestive intestine system. In preferred embodiments linear and cyclic stereoisomer peptides are conjugated to a biocompatible polymer further enhancing their bioavailability and therefore can be administered orally without protection against proteolysis by stomach acid. The peptides comprising the active material are stable at low pH and resistant to degradation by enzymes. Generally the chemical modification contemplated here permits stability of the components and inhibition of proteolysis by enzymes of the digestive tract and increased overall circulation time in the body.

In other embodiment the formulation will include inert ingredients which allow for further protection against the digestive system environment and release of the biologically active material in the intestine and blood stream. Also contemplated for use herein are liquid dosage forms for oral administration including emulsions solutions suspensions and syrups which may contain other components. A coating impermeable to acid pH may be considered to ensure full gastric resistance. Examples of inert ingredients used as enteric coatings are polyvinyl acetate phthalate and their derivatives. Capsules may consist of a hard shell for delivery of dry therapeutic i.e. powder for liquid forms a soft gelatin shell may be used. Colorants and or flavoring agents and diluents may also be included. Certain inorganic salts may be used as fillers. Disintegrants may be included in the formulation as well as binders to hold the compounds together to form a tablet and may include starch and gelatin. The unique properties of the compounds of this invention allows flexibility in the mode of administration in addition to their potential for oral bioavailability.

In one embodiment compositions for nasal rectal and vaginal delivery of the compounds of this invention are also contemplated. A therapeutic drug must be formulated to effectively penetrate the mucosa via these routes and target the earliest events of a disease or a pathogenic infection. Nasal delivery for example allows the passage of compounds to the blood stream directly after administering the therapeutic product to the nose without the necessity for deposition of the product in the lung. Formulations for nasal delivery include those with dextran or cyclodextran and excipients well known in the art. Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which may contain in addition to the active substance excipients such as cocoa butter or wax and may include lubricants made of wax or oil. Since the compounds of this invention resist degradation by enzymes found in human blood serum and body secretions flexibility in the mode of administration as a topical for harsh mucosal environments is possible.

In one embodiment formulations for topical drug delivery include ointments and creams. Ointments are semisolid preparations based on petrolatum or other petroleum derivatives. Creams containing the active ingredient include viscous liquid or semisolid emulsions. Cream bases are typically water washable and contain an oil phase an emulsifier and an aqueous phase. The oil phase is generally comprised of petrolatum and a fatty alcohol such the aqueous phase generally contains a humectant. The emulsifier in a cream formulation is generally a nonionic anionic cationic or amphoteric surfactant. The specific ointment or cream base to be used as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art is one that will provide for optimum drug delivery. As with other carriers or vehicles an ointment base should be inert stable nonirritating and nonsensitizing.

In one embodiment preparations for parenteral administration are also contemplated here and are well known in the art. They include standard sterile aqueous or non aqueous solutions suspensions or emulsions. Examples of non aqueous solvents or vehicles are polyethylene glycol propylene glycol vegetable oils such as olive oil and corn oil gelatin and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Such dosage forms may also contain preserving wetting emulsifying and dispersing agents. These formulations are sterilized by filtration by incorporating sterilizing agents into the compositions by irradiating the compositions or by heating the compositions. They can also be manufactured using injectable sterile water or sterile medium immediately before use.

In one embodiment compounds of this invention can also be delivered to the lungs by inhaling and traverse across the lung epithelial lining to the blood stream. A wide range of mechanical devices designed for pulmonary delivery of therapeutic products are commercially available including but not limited to nebulizers metered dose inhalers and powder inhalers all of which are familiar to those skilled in the art. Such devices require appropriate formulations suitable for the dispensing of compounds.

The foregoing formulations and administration methods are intended to be illustrative and not limiting. It will be appreciated that using the teaching provided herein other suitable formulations and modes of administration could be readily devised and applied to the stereoisomer peptides and the therapeutic compounds of this invention.

In one embodiment for all of the stereoisomer peptide compounds and stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate compounds as further studies are conducted information will emerge regarding appropriate dosage levels for treatment of various conditions in various patients and the ordinary skilled worker considering the therapeutic context age and general health of the recipient will be able to ascertain proper dosing. The selected dosage depends on the desired therapeutic effect on the route of administration and on the duration of the treatment desired. Generally dosage levels of 0.001 to 10 mg kg of body weight daily are administered to mammals. Physicians may initially use escalating dosages starting at a concentration that meet the requirements for each individual being treated.

In other embodiment modifications and variations of the compositions of the present invention and methods for use will be obvious to those of skill in the art from the foregoing detailed descriptions and which are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims.

In a preferred embodiment the compounds of the invention are useful in the treatment of a variety of mammalian disease conditions and disorders. Examples of such diseases in humans are abnormal angiogenesis pathological conditions of the eye including age related macular degeneration choroidal neovascularization and diabetic retinopathy cancer solid tumors tumor metastasis inflammatory diseases Alzheimer s and Parkinson s diseases atherosclerosis cardiovascular diseases multiple sclerosis autoimmune diseases diabetes rheumatoid arthritis stroke neurological disorders dementia brain disorders neurodegenerative disorders neuropsychiatric illnesses bipolar disorder diseases caused by aging and HIV AIDS and other pathogens including but not limited to prions viruses bacteria fungi and parasites.

The references cited here and throughout the entire specification are provided merely to clarify and illustrate the description of the present invention and is not an admission that any such reference is prior art to the present invention.

The following examples are meant to illustrate the invention. They are not meant to limit the invention in any way since many alternative methods techniques procedures and approaches can be readily applied.

The peptides corresponding to the inverse inverso of the naturally occurring sequence are prepared with D isomers retro using standard solid phase peptide synthesis methods. At the N terminus a lysine may be added for later use i.e. conjugation to a polymer and the epsilon amine group is protected by acetylation. The epsilon group is deprotected after synthesis to mimic the attachment point that is used to conjugate directly for example to an activated carboxyl group of a polymer or to the free carboxyl group of the end terminal residue of a linker attached to the polymer. An acid sensitive resin Cl Trt preloaded with the C terminal amino acid is used for peptide synthesis to allow for the isolation of side chain protected peptides. N alpha Fmoc and side chain protected D amino acids are activated using HCTU O 1H 6 Chloro benzotriazole 1 yl 1 1 3 3 tetramethyl uronium hexa fluoro phosphate and added at a 4 fold excess to peptide resin. An 8 fold excess of DIPEA N N diisopropylethylamine is added and the reaction proceeds for 40 80 minutes at room temperature. A ninhydrin test is performed to insure completion of the coupling cycle. Once peptide synthesis is complete the N terminal Fmoc group is removed to uncover the N terminal amine and the protected peptide containing a C terminal carboxyl is cleaved from the Cl trt resin using 30 HFIP Hexafluoroisopropanol in DCM CHCl .

The peptide fragments containing the free N terminal amine and C terminal carboxyl are then cyclized e.g. head to tail to obtain the constrained cyclic structure of the peptide using PyBOP benzotriazol 1 yl oxytri pyrrolidino phosphonium hexa fluoro phosphate and DIPEA at a ratio of 1 2 2 in DCM overnight at room temperature. The cyclized peptides are then cleaved in 95 TFA 2.5 water 2.5 triisopropylsilane QC d by HPLC and MS and purified using preparative HPLC columns with gradients of water 0.1 TFA versus acetonitrile 0.1 TFA. Fractions that meet purity requirements and are shown to contain the correct mass by nanospray mass spectrometry MS and tandem MS are then lyophilized for storage at 80 C. Amino acid analysis is utilized to determine the net amount of the peptide with the rest being counter ions acetate salt sodium potassium and other ions as well as water of hydration. The peptide purity is evaluated by analytical HPLC using a C 18 column 4.6 250 mm . The purified peptide originally produced as the TFA salt is then converted to the acetate salt using a Dowex resin that had been converted to the acetate salt form. Incubation of the peptide with the acetate resin affects the exchange of the TFA for acetate resulting in a peptide in its acetate form. The peptide is subjected to concentration determination and lyophilization. The final peptide is dispensed in small aliquots of 1 mg each and stored at low temperature until used.

Oxidation of the Cys residues of a stereoisomer peptide to form one two or three intramolecular disulfide bonds is achieved using the oxidizing agent DMSO or iodine I . Cyclization is achieved by dissolving the SH group containing stereoisomer peptide in a phosphate or bicarbonate aqueous buffer at pH 7 9. The concentration of the stereoisomer peptide is approximately 1 mg ml or less. Nonaqueous solvent such as DMF DMSO or methanol could be used alone or with water along with an appropriate proton scavenger such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine. The cyclized stereoisomer peptide is purified using high performance liquid chromatography HPLC and often times the cyclo peptide will elute earlier than the uncyclized precursor. This is due to the diminished available hydrophobic surface area in the cyclized peptide which minimizes its interaction with the reversed phase matrix. The cyclization can take from 15 minutes to 24 hours depending on the specific conditions used typically room temperature solvent stereoisomer peptide composition and solubility. The reaction can be monitored by HPLC or with Ellman s reagent which allows monitoring the amount of free SH group being consumed. In other embodiments and preferably the formation of Cys bonds is controlled by the selective use of thiol protecting groups during peptide synthesis. For example where two intramolecular disulfide bonds is desired the peptide chain is synthesized with the four Cys residues of the core sequence protected with a thiol protecting group. Thereafter the thiol protecting groups are removed from the Cys residues where the disulfide bond is desired effecting bisulfide cyclization of the monomer chain.

PLGA is synthesized by random ring opening co polymerization of two different monomers the cyclic dimers 1 4 dioxane 2 5 diones of glycolic acid and lactic acid. The reaction is catalyzed by tin II 2 ethylhexanoate tin II alkoxides or aluminum isopropoxide. During polymerization glycolic and lactic acid monomeric units are bound together by ester linkages creating the polymer PLGA which is the linear aliphatic polyester the final product. Depending on the ratio of lactide to glycolide used for the polymerization different forms of PLGA are obtained and identified based on the monomers ratio used. PLGA 75 25 has a copolymer composition of 75 lactic acid and 25 glycolic acid. PLGA is amorphous and has a glass transition temperature in the range of 40 60 C. Unlike the precursor homopolymers of lactic acid polylactide and glycolic acid polyglycolide which show poor solubilities PLGA is readily dissolved by a wide range of common solvents including acetone ethyl acetate chlorinated solvents and tetrahydrofuran.

PLGA is activated with EDAC 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethyl amino propel carbodiimide hydrochloride to form the active intermediate o Acylisourea which is subsequently reacted with sulfo NHS to form the second intermediate sulfoNHS ester after addition of the primary amine containing molecule e.i. stereoisomer peptide sulfo NHS is released and an amide bond is created between the polymer PLGA and the stereoisomer peptide creating a PLA stereoisomer peptide conjugate. In this invention the stereoisomer peptide conjugates includes the peptide ligand.

The double emulsion process water in oil in water w o w method is the method best suited for peptides. An aqueous or buffered solution of the stereoisomer peptide with a stabilizer e.g. pluronic F68 PEG 4600 or sodium glutamate is added to a solution of PLGA stereoisomer peptide PLGA conjugate in DCM or ethyl acetate with vigorous stifling to form the microemulsion which is then added with stifling into a large volume of water containing PVP which minimizes burst effect to obtain the w o w emulsion followed by solvent removal by evaporation at reduced pressure or at atmospheric pressure to evaporate DCM or by extraction to diffuse out DCM by adding a large amount of water and stifling. The solid microspheres are washed and collected by filtration centrifugation or sieving and then dried or lyophilized to obtain the final PLGA stereoisomer peptide conjugate.

The spray drying method is very rapid convenient easy to scale up involves mild conditions and is less dependent on the solubility parameter of the drug and the polymer. This process requires a double nozzle spray drying technique that uses mannitol as an anti adherent. A solution or dispersion of the stereoisomer peptide in a PLGA solution is sprayed from one nozzle and from another nozzle an aqueous mannitol solution is sprayed simultaneously producing the final microspheres. The surface of the spray dried microspheres is coated with mannitol which allows decreased agglomeration. This method produces microspheres with higher yield and encapsulation ratio as compared to other procedures.

The low temperature spraying method for preparing the nanoparticles is used to increase the efficiency of encapsulation and drug retention. The stereoisomer peptide PLGA conjugate with excipients is suspended in a PLGA solution in acetone ethyl acetate or DCM. This suspension is then sprayed into a vessel containing liquid nitrogen overlaying a frozen extraction solvent like ethanol. The liquid nitrogen is subjected to evaporation causing the polymer solvent from the frozen droplets to be extracted then by liquid ethanol. This process increases the nanospheres encapsulation efficiencies above 95 .

Synthesis of polymer conjugates is carried out using the precursor HPMA MA GFLG ONp to couple a target specific stereoisomer peptide in linear or cyclic form and in retro inverso or inverso configuration to the polymer backbone via degradable GFKG linkers to generate a HPMA GFLG stereoisomer Peptide polymer conjugate or using the precursor HPMA MA GG ONp to couple a peptide ligand PL transduction domain or cell penetrating peptides which is also a stereoisomer peptide to the polymer backbone via non degradable GG linkers to generate a HPMA GG Ppolymer conjugate. Briefly the precursor HPMA MA GFLG ONp 20 mmol ONp and stereoisomer peptide 26 mmol are dissolved in 400 l DMF. 30 ml of N N diisopropylethylamine DIPEA 177 mmol diluted in DMF 1 1 v v is added slowly drop wise with a Hamilton micro syringe while stifling the mixture at room temperature in the dark overnight. Unreacted ONp groups are deactivated hydrolyzed with 1 amino 2 propanol 2 ml the mixture containing HPMA GFLG stereoisomer peptide is diluted in deionized water. The solution is dialyzed intensively and then lyophilized. A conjugate with high PL content is synthesized similarly using polymer precursor HPMA MA GG ONp. The exact amount of stereoisomer peptide and stereoisomer peptide ligand content of each separate conjugate is determined by amino acid analysis.

MA GFLG D peptide and MA GG Pmonomers can be synthesized each separately following the procedure described above except that the monomer precursor MA GFLG ONp is used to attach a stereoisomer peptide and MA GG ONp is used to attach the peptide ligand P. Briefly the monomers MA GFLG ONp 20 mmol ONp and stereoisomer peptide 26 mmol and MA GG ONp 20 mmol ONp and peptide ligand P 26 mmol are dissolved in 400 l DMF is separate reactions 30 ml of N N diisopropylethylamine DIPEA 177 mmol diluted in DMF 1 1 v v is added to each mixture slowly drop wise with a Hamilton micro syringe while stifling the mixture at room temperature in the dark overnight. Unreacted ONp groups are deactivated hydrolyzed with 1 amino 2 propanol 2 ml the mixture containing MA GFLG D peptide or MA GG Pis diluted with deionized water. The solution is dialyzed intensively and then lyophilized. The exact amounts of peptide ligand or stereoisomer peptide content of each separate monomer is determined by amino acid analysis.

The monomers MA GFLG D peptide and MA GG Pare then polymerized with HPMA via radical polymerization of the monomers using AIBN 2 2 azobisisobutyronitrile as the initiator in the presence of DMSO and the inert gas argon to obtain the polymer conjugate HPMA GFLG D peptide GG LP which contains one stereoisomer peptide coupled via a degradable GFLG linker and a peptide ligand conjugated via a non degradable GG linker. The peptide ligand can be a transduction peptide or a receptor binding peptide or a cell penetrating peptide to guide the polymer to tissue cells or sub cellular locations and deliver the stereoisomer peptide to the target protein to compete bind or block a functional site of the target disease protein.

The polymerization is carried out using mixtures of HPMA MA Pand MA GFLG ONp at various molar ratios using the initiator 2 2 azobisisobutironitrile AIBN . The solution containing the monomers in desired molar ratios dissolved in acetone and mixed with the initiator is transferred to an ampoule and bubbled with nitrogen for 5 min sealed and placed in an oil bath at 50 C. for 24 hours under stirring. After 24 hours the copolymers precipitate out of solution and the ampoules are cooled to room temperature and placed in the freezer for 20 minutes to increase the yield of the precipitated polymer further. The copolymer is filtered off dissolved in methanol and precipitated in ether. After filtration and washing with ether the copolymer is dried under vacuum. The molecular weight of the ligand targeted copolymer HPMA GFLG ONp Pis analyzed by HPLC.

MA P stereoisomer peptide ligand can be synthesized directly without a GG linker by mixing 0.1 mmol of the peptide ligand in 1 ml of 0.1N NaOH 0.1 mmol and cooled at 0 C. Freshly distilled MACL 15.6 mg 0.15 mM in 1 ml of dichloromethane is added drop wise a room temperature and allowed to react for one hour while maintaining the pH around 6 7. The organic layer is separated from the water layer washed with 2 ml of water and discarded. The aqueous layer together with the washings is mixed with 40 ml of EtOAc. Under vigorous stifling and cooling HCL is added slowly until pH reaches 2 3. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted 3 with EtOAc 3 20 ml . The extracted layers are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate overnight. The dried solution is filtered and washed with EtOAc which is later removed with a rotary evaporator to obtain the final product as a white powder which is re crystallized from EtOAc.

The copolymer precursor HPMA MA P MA GFLG ONp and stereoisomer peptide are conjugated in the presence of DMF and DIPEA. The reactive ester groups of the pre activated copolymer HPMA P GFLG ONp are reacted with the stereoisomer peptide via nucleophilic attack of the amino groups alpha amino forming amide linkages with the linker.

The copolymer precursor HPMA MA PL MA GFLG ONp 20 mmol ONp and stereoisomer peptide 26 mmol are dissolved in 400 l DMF. 30 ml of N N diisopropylethylamine DIPEA 177 mmol diluted in DMF 1 1 v v is added slowly drop wise with a Hamilton micro syringe while stirring the mixture at room temperature in the dark overnight. The reactive ester groups i.e. carboxyl groups of residues converted to p nitrophenyl ester of the pre activated copolymer HPMA PL GFLG ONp are reacted with the stereoisomer peptide via nucleophilic attack of the amino groups alpha amino forming amide linkages with the linker. Stereoisomer peptides can also be bound to the linker by the amino group of a Lys residue attached to the linker or to the amino group of a D Lys residue in the stereoisomer peptide. Unreacted ONp groups are deactivated hydrolyzed with 1 amino 2 propanol 2 ml the mixture containing the final product HPMA PL GFLG D peptide is diluted in deionized water. The solution is dialyzed intensively and then lyophilized. The exact content of stereoisomer peptide ligand and stereoisomer peptide is determined by amino acid analysis.

Pre activated copolymer HPMA GFLG ONp is also commercially available allowing the reduction of several synthesis steps facilitating the rapid preparation of novel compounds. Briefly coupling the amine group of different stereoisomer peptides directly to HPMA GFLG ONp in separate reactions and then copolymerizing them all together with the monomer MA GG P a ligand targeted multi stereoisomer peptide polymer conjugate of the form HPMA GFLG D peptide 3 GG PL is created. The copolymer conjugates are synthesized via p nitrophenyl ester aminolysis of the pre activated copolymer precursor forming amide linkages between the reactive p nitrophenyl ester groups of the linker and the amino groups preferably amino groups in the stereoisomer D peptide. This reaction is carried out by adding a solution of the D peptide in DMF dimethyl formamide and triethylamine 5 1 and the mixture is stirred overnight at room temperature while protected from direct light after which it is diluted with water 3 ml dialyzed extensively against distilled deionized water and then lyophilized and stored at 20 C.

The skilled artisan will recognize that variations of the synthesis described in this specification may be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example the stereoisomer peptide 1.3 times excess molar equivalents may be dissolved in dry N N DMF under constant stirring followed by addition of dry pyridine 1 1 molar equivalents relative to the polymeric ONp content and polymeric precursor in dry DMF. The reaction mixture is bubbled with nitrogen and continuously stirred at room temperature for 22 hours at 50 C. The reaction is terminated with 1 amino 2 propanol. The crude conjugate is dialyzed against deionized water lyophilized and stored at 20 C. The peptide content in the conjugate is determined by amino acid analysis. The conjugate molecular weight is estimated by size exclusion chromatography.
