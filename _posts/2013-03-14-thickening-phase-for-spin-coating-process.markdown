title: Thickening phase for spin coating process
abstract: Among other things, one or more techniques and systems for performing a spin coating process associated with a wafer and for controlling thickness of a photoresist during the spin coating process are provided. In particular, a thickening phase is performed during the spin coating process in order to increase a thickness of the photoresist. For example, air temperature of down flow air, flow speed of the down flow air, and heat temperature of heat supplied towards the wafer are increased during the thickening phase. The increase in down flow air and heat increase a vaporization factor of the photoresist, which results in an increase in viscosity and thickness of the photoresist. In this way, the wafer can be rotated at relatively lower speeds, while still attaining a desired thickness. Lowering rotational speed of wafers allows for relatively larger wafers to be stably rotated.

Lithography generally refers to processes for transferring one or more patterns between various media. In lithography a light sensitive resist coating is formed over one or more layers to which a pattern is to be transferred. The resist coating is then patterned by exposing it to one or more types of radiation or light that selectively passes through an intervening mask containing the pattern. The light causes exposed or unexposed portions of the resist coating to become more or less soluble depending on the type of resist used positive or negative . A developer is then used to remove the more soluble areas leaving the patterned resist. The patterned resist can then serve as a template for the underlying layer or layers which can be selectively etched or doped or otherwise treated . Once the underlying layer is treated the patterned resist is removed such as chemically stripped thus leaving the treated layer having the pattern formed therein.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

One or more systems and techniques for performing a spin coating process associated with a wafer or for controlling thickness of photoresist during wafer processing such as the spin coating process are provided herein. During lithography patterning a spin coating process is used to apply a photoresist onto a wafer. For example photoresist is dispensed onto the wafer and the wafer is rotated so that the photoresist is distributed across a surface of the wafer according to a target thickness. The speed of rotating the wafer is adjusted to control the thickness of the photoresist. Because a relatively large wafer cannot be spun stably at relatively fast speeds due to tangential velocity at a wafer edge of the wafer multiple types of photoresists having varying viscosities which can affect thickness of the photoresist are used to cover various ranges of photoresist thickness specified for one or more masks used during fabrication. Accordingly heat and down flow air are used to control thickness of the photoresist so that the photoresist can be used for a larger range of target thicknesses regardless of wafer size because thickness can be controlled by temperature or down flow air as opposed to merely from rotational speed of the wafer. In particular an increase in temperature can increase a vaporization factor of the photoresist thus resulting in an increased viscosity of the photoresist. The increased viscosity can increase thickness of the photoresist. In this way increased heat or down air flow are used to control thickness of the photoresist during a thickening phase or other phases of the spin coating process.

In some embodiments a spin coating process includes one or more phases such as a resist reduction coating phase of a first solvent a dispense phase of a photoresist onto a wafer a thickening phase that increases a vaporization factor of the photoresist using heat or air to increase a viscosity or thickness of the photoresist a main wafer spin phase that rotates the wafer according to a uniform thickness metric or an edge bead rinse of a second solvent to wash out at least a portion of the photoresist along a wafer edge of the wafer. An air flow device is configured to supply down flow air substantially towards a top portion of the wafer during one or more phases according to air settings for respective phases. For example the air flow device provides down flow air according to a baseline temperature or a baseline flow speed during the dispense phase based upon a dispense phase air setting. During a heating portion of the thickening phase the air flow device provides the down flow air according to an increased temperature or an increase flow speed based upon a first thickening phase air setting. In this way the down flow air is supplied at particular temperatures or flow speeds according to air settings for respective phases of the spin coating process. A heat device is configured to supply heat substantially towards a bottom portion of the wafer during one or more phases according to heat settings for respective phases. For example the heat device provides heat such as at a baseline heat temperature during the dispense phase based upon a dispense phase heat setting. During the heating portion of the thickening phase the heat device provides the heat according to an increased heat temperature based upon a first thickening phase heat setting. In an example during a cooling portion of the thickening phase the air flow device can modify or maintain the down flow air based upon a second thickening phase air setting. In another example during the cooling portion of the thickening phase the heat device can modify or maintain the heat based upon a second thickening phase heat setting. In this way the air flow device and the heat device can control thickness of the photoresist during one or more phases of the spin coating process so that a photoresist having a particular initial viscosity can be used for a relatively larger range of thicknesses. In this way a relatively smaller number of photoresists having various viscosities can be used to generate one or more masks for lithography.

For example the down flow air and the heat are used to increase a vaporization factor of the photoresist. Increasing the vaporization factor results in an increased viscosity of the photoresist. A thickness of the photoresist is increased because of the increased viscosity.

In another example the heat device is configured to supply the heat according to a main wafer spin phase heat setting during the main wafer spin phase . The heat is supplied substantially towards the bottom portion of the wafer. In some embodiments the heat is supplied at the baseline heat temperature.

In some embodiments an EBR phase air setting for the EBR phase specifies that the baseline air temperature is to be used for the air temperature and that the baseline flow speed is to be used for the flow speed . An EBR phase heat setting for the EBR phase specifies that the baseline heat temperature is to be used for the heat temperature . In this way an air flow device and a heat device can utilize the one or more air settings and heat settings to control the air temperature the flow speed and the heat temperature during one or more phases of the spin coating process.

In an example during one or more phases such as the dispense phase occurring before the thickening phase the air flow device is configured to supply the down air flow according to a baseline air temperature and a baseline flow speed. The air flow device is configured to increase at least one of an air temperature or a flow speed of the down flow air during a heating portion of the thickening phase according to a first thickening phase air setting . The increased air temperature or the increased flow speed can increase a vaporization factor of the photoresist in order to increase a viscosity of the photoresist . In this way the photoresist becomes relatively thicker so that the main wafer spin phase occurring after the thickening phase can rotate the wafer relatively slower while still achieving a target thickness. In an example the heat device is configured to increase the heat such as a heat temperature of the heat according to a first thickening phase heat setting . The increased heat temperature can increase the vaporization factor of the photoresist thus resulting in a relatively thicker photoresist .
