title: Tactical capsule charge system
abstract: A tactical capsule charge system includes a plurality of plastic containers connected serially, mechanically, and explosively by detonating cord. Each plastic container contains composition C-4 that is detonated by the detonating cord that passes through the interior of the container. The quantity of PETN inside the container is enhanced by tying a knot in the detonating cord in the interior of the container or by wrapping the detonating cord in the interior of the container with PETN sheet. Any number of containers may be used and they may be spaced along the detonating cord at any desired interval.

Chokepoints are narrow passages through which traffic moves. The traffic may be pedestrian or vehicular or both. In hostile situations chokepoints are often locations for ambushes and or for seeding with explosives such as Improvised Explosive Devices LEDs . Examples of chokepoints include bridges alleys and doorways. Chokepoints may also be naturally occurring narrow passages in land or other formations. Hazards at chokepoints such as hidden explosives have long been a problem in warfare and especially in recent conflicts.

Known line clearance or line charges may be used to explosively clear a chokepoint. A Mine Clearing Line Charge MICLIC is a mine clearing device used to clear a path for tanks vehicles and personnel through minefields or other obstacles. The MICLIC line charge is propelled by a 5 inch rocket motor and then detonated clearing a vehicle lane that is 100 meters long and 8 meters wide. An Antipersonnel Obstacle Breaching System APOBS is an explosive line charge system used to breach antipersonnel minefields and multi strand wire obstacles. It is carried by two soldiers with backpacks. The APOBS rocket is fired from a 35 meter standoff position clearing a footpath up to 45 meters long. A Man Portable Line Charge MPLC is a rocket launched detonation cord that clears a 20 meter long footpath. The MPLC can be carried in one backpack.

Known line charges are generally used to sympathetically detonate explosive hazards such as mines and IEDs. Most of the known line charges are intended to clear long distances. The known line charges can be a burden to transport. At a minimum a separate backpack may be required for each line charge. Sometimes a separate vehicle may be required for each line charge. One reason for the large weight of line charges is that many line charge systems are made with metal. Another disadvantage of the use of metal in line charges is the creation of metal fragments that are dangerous to personnel and equipment. Metal fragments may also contaminate the soil. In some cases it is more desirable to disable an explosive hazard or to mark and circumvent an explosive hazard rather than to sympathetically detonate the explosive hazard using a known line charge.

One aspect of the invention is an apparatus that includes a plastic container having a central longitudinal axis a pair of axially opposed ends an interior and a circular opening in each axially opposed end centered on the central longitudinal axis. The plastic container encloses the interior except for the circular openings. The plastic container has two mating halves. The circular openings in the axially opposed ends are defined by adjacent semi circular openings in the two mating halves.

A detonating cord containing pentaerythritol tetranitrate PETN extends through the circular opening in one axially opposed end the interior of the container and the circular opening in the other axially opposed end. A high explosive is disposed in the interior of the container and surrounds the detonating cord. A total quantity of PETN in the interior is greater than a quantity of PETN contained in a piece of the detonating cord having a length equal to a distance between the circular openings in the axially opposed ends.

In another embodiment the detonating cord extends substantially linearly along the central longitudinal axis between the axially opposed circular openings and PETN sheet is wrapped around the detonating cord in the interior of the plastic container.

Each mating half may include a central storage portion and opposed external tapered portions that abut the central storage portion and taper inwardly away from the central storage portion. Each mating half may include opposed internal tapered portions that taper outwardly from respective semi circular openings toward the central storage portion. Each mating half may include a pair of diagonally opposed tabs and a pair of diagonally opposed ribs fixed in interiors of the opposed external tapered portions. Ends of the pair of diagonally opposed tabs of each mating half may extend into the interiors of the opposed external tapered portions of the other mating half.

At least one mating half may include a removable insert disposed in the central storage portion. The insert may include longitudinal sides that define a storage volume therebetween. The storage volume may be about one half a volume of the central storage portion.

The central storage portion of each mating half may include a recessed portion. The recessed portion may include a longitudinal axis that is parallel to the central longitudinal axis of the plastic container.

Another aspect of the invention is a charge system that includes a plurality of the above described plastic containers connected in series by the detonating cord. An initiator may be connected to a free end of the detonating cord.

In another aspect a method of making a charge system includes providing detonating cord composition C 4 explosive and a plurality of mating halves of a plastic container. Each mating half has a central longitudinal axis a pair of axially opposed ends an interior and a semi circular opening in each axially opposed end centered on the central longitudinal axis.

The method includes placing the composition C 4 explosive in the respective interiors of two mating halves and then closing the two mating halves together around the detonating cord such that the detonating cord extends through a pair of circular openings formed by abutting the semi circular openings of the two mating halves.

The two mating halves are then secured together. A plurality of the plastic containers may be connected mechanically and explosively in series by the detonating cord.

In one embodiment the method may include forming a knot in the detonating cord and closing the two mating halves together around the knot in the detonating cord.

In another embodiment the method may include wrapping PETN sheet around the detonating cord and closing the two mating halves together around the PETN sheet wrapped around the detonating cord.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A novel tactical capsule charge system clears surface clutter at chokepoints and exposes explosive hazards at chokepoints. Clearing the surface clutter increases the effectiveness of explosive detectors. The tactical capsule charge system is not designed to sympathetically detonate the explosive hazard. The capsule charge system is lighter in weight and more mobile than known tactical charge systems. The explosive output of the charge system may be easily varied by varying the number of capsules in the charge system. The capsules are plastic containers that contain explosive material such as composition C 4.

A capsule may be as small as about four inches by two inches by two inches. One or a plurality of capsules may be used. The length of the path cleared may be varied by adding more capsules in series. The explosive output per capsule may be varied by using volume reducing inserts that provide a contained volume for a reduced amount of C 4 explosive. The charge system can be emplaced in many different ways including but not limited to hand emplacement hand thrown robotic emplacement etc.

Each capsule is a plastic container that is composed of a pair of plastic mating shells or container halves. The number of containers used for a particular charge system is tailored to the needs of a particular situation. A removable insert for each mating half is used to vary the contained volume for C 4 explosive. In one embodiment the removable insert reduces the contained volume by about one half.

An exemplary detonating cord has a core of pentaerythritol tetranitrate PETN surrounded by plastic material. In one embodiment detonating cord has an outside diameter of about 0.197 inches and 50 grains foot of PETN. Plastic containers contain a high explosive for example composition C 4. Composition C 4 may not detonate effectively unless it is in a contained volume. Containers may be spaced apart along detonating cord any distance. In one embodiment containers are separated by about 6 18 inches of detonating cord . shows six containers . However a single container may be used or any number of containers may be serially connected with cord .

Detonating cord extends through circular opening in one axially opposed end through the interior of container and out of circular opening in axially opposed end . A high explosive such as composition C 4 is disposed in the interior of container and surrounds detonating cord in container . A piece of PETN detonating cord having a length equal to a distance A between circular openings in axially opposed ends may not be sufficient to detonate the C 4 in the interior of container . Thus additional PETN is added so that the total quantity of PETN in the interior of container is greater than the quantity of PETN contained in a piece of detonating cord having a length equal to distance A.

As shown schematically in in one embodiment the additional PETN may be supplied by tying a knot in a portion of detonating cord that is in the interior of plastic container . Knot may be for example a double overhand knot. In another embodiment as shown schematically in the additional PETN may be supplied by wrapping PETN sheet around a portion of detonating cord that is in the interior of plastic container . PETN sheet is available in 0.25 inch thickness. In detonating cord extends substantially linearly along central longitudinal axis X between axially opposed circular openings .

In one embodiment of container dimensions E F G are about two inches two inches and one inch respectively. In this size of container the additional amount of PETN supplied by knot or PETN sheet is about three times the amount of PETN in a piece of detonating cord having a length A. In general one may increase dimensions E F or G without a corresponding increase in the amount of additional PETN because once the minimum amount of PETN needed to detonate the C 4 is supplied that amount of PETN will also detonate a larger amount of enclosed C 4. In addition to increasing the amount of PETN in container knot or PETN sheet also advantageously hinders axial translation of detonating cord with respect to container .

Referring to each mating half of container includes a central storage portion . The central storage portions of two mating halves that form container define the enclosed volume of container that is filled with C 4. For maximum effectiveness the C 4 should completely fill the enclosed volume. A pair of opposed external tapered portions abut central storage portion and taper inwardly away from central storage portion . Each mating half includes a pair of opposed internal tapered portions that taper outwardly from respective semi circular openings toward central storage portion .

Each mating half includes a pair of diagonally opposed tabs and a pair of diagonally opposed ribs . Tabs and ribs are fixed in interiors of respective opposed external tapered portions . A rib is disposed transverse to each tab . Ends of the pair of diagonally opposed tabs of each mating half extend into the interiors of opposed external tapered portions of the other mating half . Ribs and tabs function as alignment aids when assembling two mating halves to form container .

Central storage portion of each mating half includes a recessed portion . Recessed portion includes a longitudinal axis Y that is parallel to central longitudinal axis X. Recessed portion enables C 4 placed in central storage portion to expand into recessed portion when two mating halves are closed together around detonating cord . The detonating cord disposed in the two mating halves may include knot or may be wrapped with PETN sheet .

To create a smaller enclosed volume for C 4 in central storage portion an insert may be disposed in central storage portion . Insert has longitudinal sides that define a storage volume therebetween. In one embodiment storage volume is about one half the volume of central storage portion . The smaller volume created by insert may be desirable when less C 4 is needed for a particular scenario. An insert may be disposed in one or both mating halves of container .

Charge system may be constructed in the following manner. First one may choose to use knots in cord or to use PETN sheet wrapped around cord . If knots are used then knots are tied in cord at spaced apart intervals corresponding to the desired spacing of plastic containers . If knots are not used then PETN sheet is wrapped around cord at spaced apart intervals corresponding to the desired spacing of plastic containers . Of course one could use a knot at one location on cord and PETN sheet at another location on cord .

Next a piece of composition C 4 is placed in each central storage portion of a pair of mating halves . In one embodiment the piece of C 4 weighs about 0.25 pounds and is about two inches wide two inches long and one inch thick. Because C 4 is available in two inch by one inch by ten inch rectangular blocks one may simply slice two inch pieces from a block of C 4. The dimensions E F G of central storage portion may be about two inches two inches and one inch respectively.

Then detonating cord with either knot or PETN sheet wrapped around it is placed on the piece of C 4 in one of the mating halves and cord is aligned so that it rests in semi circular openings at opposed ends of mating half . The task of aligning cord is greatly simplified by opposed internal tapered portions . The two mating halves are then closed together so that the respective semi circular openings on each half are aligned to create circular openings of container . The process of aligning mating halves is facilitated by diagonally opposed tabs and ribs . Closing together the mating halves causes the pieces of C 4 to deform around cord and also around knot or PSTN sheet wrapped around cord . The C 4 also deforms into each recessed portion of mating halves .

Mating halves may be secured together using for example tape wrapped transversely around the mating halves. Other securing methods may also be used.

As many additional containers as desired are then formed as described above to create a charge system having a plurality of containers mechanically and explosively connected in series by cord . Initiator is fixed to free end of cord to detonate charge system .

Charge system may be for example placed by hand or robot or thrown by hand. In some cases charge system may be thrown similar to a lasso ahead of the area to be cleared. Then containers may be pulled back into the area to be cleared using free end of cord to thereby straighten out cord and properly position containers . In this regard opposed external tapered portions help prevent containers from getting snagged or hung up while dragging. In addition the external surface of container includes smooth radii and curved contours rather than sharp corners to help prevent snagging.

Another important advantage of the invention is the greatly decreased shipping hazard of charge system compared to known line charges. Detonating cord and composition C 4 are available separately and may be shipped and transported separately. Only at the area of use of charge system is it necessary to place the C 4 into direct contact with the detonating cord .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
