The invention relates generally to online shopping. In particular the invention relates to crediting a retailer for purchases made by consumers via an Internet Web site of a merchant different than that of the retailer while the consumer is located within or in the proximity of one of the retailer s locations.

Retail bookstores and other retailers provide a convenient environment in the form of physical retail store locations for consumers to browse products prior to making a purchase. The store locations typically have many different products on display so that a consumer can examine and compare products before making a purchasing decision. Many of these retailers make most if not all of their revenue from in store sales.

However the advent of wireless electronic devices such as smartphones and mobile computers allow consumers to browse products in a retail store location but purchase the product outside of the retailer s environment. For example a consumer shopping for books at a bookstore may find a book to purchase. While in the bookstore the consumer may use a wireless electronic device to browse an Internet Web site of a different merchant to purchase the same book or a digital version of the book. In this example although the retailer provided the shopping environment that led to the book purchase the retailer would not share in the revenue or profits of the purchase. As the percentage of Internet purchases continues to grow and the number of consumers carrying wireless electronic devices also continues to grow retailers having physical retail locations need a means to capitalize on in store Internet purchases in order to avoid losing significant revenue.

One aspect of the present invention provides a computer program product for providing a credit to a retailer for a purchase made by a consumer from an Internet merchant. The computer program product can include a computer readable medium including computer readable program code for receiving information identifying a product for purchase computer readable program code for receiving information identifying a location of a device used by the consumer to purchase the product computer readable program code for determining whether the location of the device corresponds to a retail location of the retailer and computer readable program code for providing a credit to the retailer based on a determination that the location of the device corresponds to a retail location of the retailer.

Another aspect of the present invention provides a system for providing a credit to a retailer for a purchase made by a consumer from an Internet merchant. This system can include a computer system for receiving information identifying a product for purchase and information identifying a location of a device used by the consumer to complete the purchase a data storage unit coupled to the computer system for storing information identifying a plurality of retailers and a retailer crediting module coupled to the computer system for determining whether the location of the device corresponds to a retail location of the retailer and for providing a credit to the retailer based on a determination that the location of the device corresponds to a retail location of the retailer.

Another aspect of the present invention provides a method for providing a credit to a retailer for a purchase made by a consumer from an Internet merchant. This method includes the steps of receiving from a client device associated with the consumer at a computer system associated with the Internet merchant information identifying a product for purchase receiving from the client device at the computer system information identifying a location of the client device used by the consumer to complete the purchase determining by the computer system whether the location of the client device corresponds to a retail location of the retailer and associating by the computer system a credit to the retailer based on a determination that the location of the client device corresponds to a retail location of the retailer.

Another aspect of the present invention provides a computer implemented method for crediting a retailer for a purchase. This method includes the steps of receiving at a computer system information identifying a product a consumer intends to purchase receiving at the computer system information identifying a location of the consumer completing by the computer system the purchase of the product determining by the computer system whether to credit a retailer for the purchase by determining whether the location of the consumer corresponds to a retail location associated with the retailer and in response to a determination that the location of the consumer corresponds to a retail location applying by the computer system a credit to the retailer.

In certain exemplary embodiments the transaction processing module may include or be coupled to a third party payment processor not shown . Consumers having an account with a third party payment processor can make purchases from Internet merchants without disclosing sensitive payment information e.g. credit card number to the Internet merchant . Instead the consumer provides payment information for one or more financial accounts e.g. checking account credit card account etc. to the third party payment processor for use in Internet transactions. When purchasing a product from an Internet merchant that accepts payments via the third party payment processor the consumer can select from one of the financial accounts to pay for the product. The third party payment processor can then debit the selected account for the amount of the purchase and credit this amount to an account of the Internet merchant . Examples of third party payment processors include GOOGLE CHECKOUT and PAYPAL.

The Web server of the Internet merchant can include or be coupled to a retailer crediting module . The retailer crediting module can determine if a purchase from the Internet merchant was received from a consumer located within or in the proximity of a store location of a retailer . If so the retailer crediting module can determine a credit to be distributed to the retailer for the purchase.

The retailer crediting module can determine if a purchase from the Internet merchant was received from a consumer located within or in the proximity of a retailer location by comparing the information identifying the location of the client device with retailer information stored in a retailer database that is stored on or coupled to the Web server . This retailer information can include information associated with any number of retailers that are partnered with or otherwise associated with the Internet merchant to receive credit for purchases made from the Internet merchant by a consumer located within or in the proximity of a store location of the retailer . Retailer information may include the retailer s name information identifying particular store locations e.g. store name code GPS coordinates associated with each store location products offered by the retailer for which credits may be received network address of the store location s Wi Fi gateway barcodes or other types of codes associated with the retailer and or a store location of the retailer and any other information associated with retailers . The GPS coordinates for each store may include a center point of the store location and a radius. The GPS coordinates can also include coordinates identifying the store location s perimeter .

If the information identifying the location of the client device matches information associated with a retailer or a retailer s store location the retailer crediting module can determine whether a credit is appropriate and the amount of the credit to be given to the retailer . A credit may be appropriate for certain products only or for purchases made during a certain time period only. For example if a consumer purchases a product from the Internet merchant that is not offered by the retailer although the consumer is located at one of the retailer s store locations the retailer may not be eligible for a credit. The amount of the credit may also depend on the product s purchased. For example the credit given to a retailer may be a flat fee based on the product or a percentage of the price of the product. Although not shown the Internet merchant can include one or more credit databases for accruing credits for retailers .

In step a retailer database is developed. The retailer database can include information associated with retailers eligible for a credit for purchases made from the Internet merchant while the consumer is located within or in the proximity of a store location of the retailer . For example the Internet merchant may partner with one or more retailers to provide credits to these retailers for appropriate purchases. In an alternative embodiment a third party who may be involved in the Internet transaction such as a payment processor receiving payment from the customer and providing payment to the merchant may partner with the retailers to provide them with credits for appropriate purchases. Information associated with each of the one or more retailers can be stored in the retailer database . As described above with reference to the retailer information can include the retailer s name information identifying particular store locations e.g. store name code GPS coordinates of each store location products offered by the retailer for which credits may be received network address of the store location s Wi Fi gateway bar codes or other types of codes associated with the retailer and or a store location of the retailer and any other information associated with retailers .

In step the Web server receives information associated with an Internet purchase from the client device associated with the consumer . This information can include information identifying one or more products for purchase and information identifying the location of the client device . The product identification module can receive the information identifying the one or more products for purchase and communicate this information to the Internet purchasing module . The location identification module can receive information identifying the location of the client device and communicate this information to the Internet purchasing module . After receiving the information associated with the Internet purchase the Internet purchasing module communicates this information to the Web server of the Internet merchant . Step is described in further detail below with reference to .

In step the Web server completes the purchase of the one or more products. The Web server can use the information identifying each of the one or more products to search a product database not shown for a matching or similar product offered by the Internet merchant . For example if the consumer is attempting to purchase a musical compact disc CD the Web server can search for that CD or for a downloadable version of the CD. After finding a matching or similar product the Web server can present information associated with the matching or similar product to the consumer via a user interface such as an Internet Web site at the client device . The consumer can then decide whether to purchase the matching or similar product. If the consumer decides to purchase the matching or similar product the Internet purchasing module can prompt the consumer for payment information delivery information and any other information necessary to complete the transaction. After receiving this transaction information the transaction processing module can complete the transaction. Step is described in further detail below with reference to .

The retailer crediting module can compare the information identifying the location of the client device to the retailer information stored in the retailer database to determine if the client device was located within or in the proximity of a retailer location when the purchase was completed.

In certain exemplary embodiments the retailer crediting module compares GPS coordinates obtained by the location identification module to GPS coordinates of one or more store locations stored in the retailer database . The GPS coordinates stored in the retailer database can include a center or near center coordinate and a radius or coordinates defining a perimeter of the store locations . If the GPS coordinates obtained by the location identification module are located within or proximal to a store location of a retailer that retailer may be eligible for a credit.

In certain exemplary embodiments the retailer crediting module compares information identifying a retailer or store location obtained from in store posters or signage to the retailer information stored in the retailer database . This information can include the name of the retailer a code for the retailer a store name a store code or any other information that can be used to identify a retailer or store location . If the information matches a retailer or store location of the retailer that retailer may be eligible for a credit.

In certain exemplary embodiments the retailer crediting module compares a network address of a store location s Wi Fi gateway to network addresses associated with store locations or retailers in the retailer database . If the network address of the store location s Wi Fi gateway matches a network address associated with a store location or retailer in the retailer database that retailer may be eligible for a credit.

If the retailer crediting module determines that the location of the client device matches information associated with a retailer or a retailer s store location the retailer crediting module can determine whether the retailer is eligible for a credit based on the product s purchased. For example the retailer may not offer one of the product s purchased from the Internet merchant and thus may not be eligible for a credit for that purchased product. Or the Internet merchant and the retailer may agree to award credits for certain products only. Additionally the Internet merchant may award credits for predefined time periods only.

If the retailer crediting module determines that a retailer should be credited for the purchase the method branches to step . Otherwise the method branches to step .

In step the Internet merchant provides a credit to the retailer . In certain exemplary embodiments the Internet merchant accrues credits for a retailer for a predetermined time period and provides the credits at the end of that time period.

As discussed above in an alternative embodiment a third party such as a payment processor may provide the credit to the retailer instead of the merchant .

In another embodiment other entities related to a give transaction in addition to the retailer may receive credits. For example a payment processor such as one assisting in the apportionment of credits between merchants retailers and other entities may also receive credits stemming from the purchase. Additionally a publisher or other manufacturer of the product being purchased e.g. the publisher of an e book being purchased may receive credits. Moreover retailers also may receive additional credits for facilitating the purchase of goods from an online merchant . For example a retailer that displays signage for an online merchant or a QR code associated with a link to purchase a product from an online merchant can receive additional credits when a consumer purchases the product from an online merchant .

In step the Web server determines whether there are more purchases to process. If so the method returns to step . Otherwise the method ends.

In step the product identification module of the client device receives information identifying a product for purchase. In certain exemplary embodiments the consumer may scan a UPC barcode an EAN barcode a two dimensional barcode or other type of barcode or an in store poster or signage associated with a product.
