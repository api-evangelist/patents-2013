title: System and method for chart based order entry
abstract: Systems and methods for chart-based order entry are described. According to one example method a chart is used to display historical market data corresponding to a tradeable object. An order entry interface is displayed in relation to the chart. The order entry interface includes a plurality of price objects for selecting price levels to be used for trade orders to buy or sell the tradeable object. According to one example method, the price levels corresponding to the price objects depend on a location of the interface in relation to the chart, and as the interface is moved in relation to the chart, the price levels are automatically updated. Upon selection of the price level on the interface, a trade order to buy or sell is submitted to a matching engine at an electronic exchange.

The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 218 162 filed Aug. 25 2011 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 620 794 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 546 451 filed Aug. 24 2009 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 027 908 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 693 219 filed Mar. 29 2007 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 580 883 the contents of all of which are fully incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.

The present invention is directed towards electronic trading. More specifically the present invention is directed to tools for chart based order entry in an electronic trading environment.

Electronic trading is generally based on a host exchange one or more computer networks and client devices. Subscribing traders are connected to an exchange s electronic trading platform by way of communication links and through an application program interface to facilitate real time electronic messaging between themselves and the exchanges. The electronic trading platform includes at least one electronic market which is at the center of the trading system and handles the matching of bids and offers placed by the traders for that market. The electronic messaging includes market information that is distributed from the electronic market to the traders via an electronic data feed. Once the traders receive the market information it may be displayed to them on their trading screens. Upon viewing the information traders can take certain actions including the actions of sending buy or sell orders to the electronic market adjusting existing orders deleting orders or otherwise managing orders. Traders may also use software tools on their client devices to automate these and additional actions.

Although the types of market information published by an electronic exchange may differ from market to market there are generally some standard pieces of information. Market information may include data that represents just the inside market. The inside market is the lowest available ask price best ask and the highest available bid price best bid in the market for a particular tradeable object at a particular point in time. Market information may also include market depth. Market depth refers to quantities available at the inside market and may also refer to quantities available at other prices away from the inside market. The quantity available at a given price level is usually provided by the exchange in aggregate sums. In other words an exchange usually provides the total buy quantity and the total sell quantity available in the market at a particular price level in its data feed. In addition to providing order book information such as price and quantity information electronic exchanges can offer other types of market information such as the open price settlement price net change volume last traded price the last traded quantity and order fill information.

The extent of market depth available for a trader usually depends on the exchange. For instance some exchanges provide market depth for all or most price levels and others may provide no market depth at all. Electronic exchanges may also limit the market depth offered as market information can become intensive for network and client devices to process. For instance an electronic market might offer only five levels of market depth which includes the quantities available at the current top five buy prices and the quantities available at the current top five sell prices.

To profit in electronic markets market participants must be able to assimilate large amounts of data to recognize market trends and to view current market conditions. Traders often use charts to analyze and predict market movements. Many traders enter trade orders to buy or sell a tradeable object via a chart. There are existing order entry systems that allow a trader to select a desired price level for a trade order on the chart. However the existing chart order entry methods suffer from accuracy problems as one pixel on the chart may represent a single or multiple price levels accurately selecting a desired price level may be impossible due to the human error and limitations of currently available user input devices. Thus it is desirable to provide a fast and more accurate order entry on a chart.

An example system and methods for chart based order entry are provided. According to one example method historical market data corresponding to a tradeable object is displayed via a chart with the historical market data being updated as new market data corresponding to the tradeable object is received from an electronic exchange so that the chart displays the historical market data as well as the current market data. An order entry interface is also displayed in relation to the chart. The order entry interface includes a plurality of price objects corresponding to a plurality of price levels. According to the example embodiment the plurality of price levels that correspond to price objects are set based on a location of the order entry interface in relation to the chart. As a user moves the order entry interface in relation to the chart the price levels also change to correspond to a new set of prices. For example upon activating the order entry interface a cursor corresponding to a user input device may be displayed at the center of the order entry interface and the location of the cursor may determine the price levels associated with the price objects. According to one example embodiment the order entry interface is divided into a bid side and an ask side having price objects corresponding to the same set of prices. When a user wishes to send a trade order for the tradeable object the user may select a desired price either on the buy side or the ask side to effectively send a buy trade order or a sell trade order to a matching engine at an electronic exchange.

Other features of the present invention will become more apparent to persons having ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention pertains from the following description and claims.

Regardless of the types of order execution algorithms used the electronic exchange provides market information to the subscribing trading stations A B. Market information may include data that represents just the inside market. The inside market is the lowest sell price best ask and the highest buy price best bid at a particular point in time. Market information may also include market depth. Additionally the exchange can offer other types of market information such as the last traded price LTP the last traded quantity LTQ and order fill information.

The computer employed as the trading stations A B generally can range from a hand held device laptop or personal computer to a larger computer such as a workstation and multiprocessor. An illustrative personal computer may use Pentium microprocessors and may operate under a Windows operating system or yet may use some other microprocessor or operating system. Generally each of the trading stations A B includes a monitor or any other output device and one or more input devices such as a keyboard and or a two or three button mouse to support click based trading if so desired. One skilled in the art of computer systems will understand that the present example embodiments are not limited to any particular class or model of computer employed for the trading stations A B and will be able to select an appropriate system.

In one example embodiment the trading stations A B use software to create specialized interactive trading screens on terminals associated with them. Trading screens preferably enable traders to among other things enter and execute orders obtain market quotes and monitor positions. The range and quality of features available to the trader on his or her trading screen may vary according to the specific software application being run. In addition to or in place of the interactive trading screens a trading station could run automated types of trading applications.

One type of trading screen that if often used at trading stations is provided by a commercially available trading application referred to as X TRADER from Trading Technologies International Inc. of Chicago Ill. X TRADER also provides an electronic trading interface referred to as MD Trader in which working orders and or bid and ask quantities are displayed in association with a static price axis or scale.

Portions of the X TRADER and the MD Trader style display are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 772 132 entitled Click Based Trading With Intuitive Grid Display of Market Depth filed on Jun. 9 2000 U.S. Pat. No. 6 938 011 entitled Click Based Trading with Market Depth Display filed on Jun. 9 2000 U.S. Pat. No. 7 127 424 entitled Click Based Trading With Intuitive Grid Display of Market Depth and Price Consolidation filed on Oct. 5 2001 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 125 894 entitled Trading Tools For Electronic Trading filed on Apr. 19 2002 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 376 417 entitled A System and Method for Trading and Displaying Market Information in an Electronic Trading Environment filed on Feb. 28 2003 the contents of each are incorporated herein by reference. Additionally the preferred embodiments are not limited to any particular product that performs translation storage and display function.

The computer employed as the gateway generally can range from a personal computer to a larger or faster computer. An illustrative gateway computer may use Pentium microprocessors and may operate under a Windows server or workstation operating system or yet some other system. Generally the gateway may additionally include a monitor or any other output device input device and access to a database if so desired. One skilled in the art of computer systems will also understand that the present example embodiments are not limited to any particular class or model of computer s employed for the gateway and will be able to select an appropriate system.

It should be noted that a computer system employed here as a trading station or a gateway generally includes a central processing unit a memory a primary and or secondary memory unit an input interface for receiving data from a communications network an input interface for receiving input signals from one or more input devices for example a keyboard mouse etc. and an output interface for communications with an output device for example a monitor . A system bus or an equivalent system may provide communications between these various elements.

Memory on either the gateway or the trading station may include a computer readable medium. The term computer readable medium as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to a processor unit for execution. Such a medium may take many forms including but not limited to non volatile media and transmission media. Non volatile media include for example optical or magnetic disks such as storage devices. Volatile media include for example dynamic memory such as main memory or random access memory RAM . Common forms of computer readable media include for example floppy disks flexible disks hard disks magnetic tape punch cards CD ROM any other physical medium memory chip or cartridge or any other medium from which a computer can read.

It should also be noted that the trading stations A B generally execute application programs resident at the trading stations A B under the control of the operating system of the trading station. Also the gateway executes application programs resident at the gateway under the control of the operating system of the gateway . In other embodiments and as understood by a person skilled in the art the function of the application programs at the trading stations A B may be performed by the gateway and likewise the function of the application programs at the gateway may be performed by the trading stations A B.

The actual electronic trading system configurations are numerous and a person skilled in the art of electronic trading systems would be able to construct a suitable network configuration. For the purposes of illustration some example configurations are provided to illustrate where the elements may be physically located and how they might be connected to form an electronic trading system. These illustrations are meant to be helpful to the reader and they are not meant to be limiting. According to one example illustration the gateway device may be located at the client site along with the trading station which is usually remote from the matching process at the electronic exchange. Alternatively no gateway is used at all.

According to the illustrated embodiment the trading stations A B the gateway and any routers communicate over the LAN and the gateway may communicate with the matching process at the electronic exchange over a T1 T3 ISDN or some other high speed connection. In another example illustration the client site may be located on the actual grounds of the electronic exchange for example in the building of the exchange . According to this instance the trading station and the gateway may still communicate over a LAN but if any routers are used they may communicate with the matching process at the electronic exchange through another connection means besides a T1 T3 or ISDN. In yet another example illustration the gateway may be housed at or near its corresponding electronic exchange. According to this instance the trading station may communicate with the gateway over a wide area network or through the use of a T1 T3 ISDN or some other high speed connection.

While a single exchange is shown in it should be understood that a trader may obtain access and trade at multiple electronic exchanges. In such an embodiment a client terminal could access multiple exchanges through multiple gateways with each gateway designated for a specific exchange. Alternatively a single gateway may be programmed to handle more than one electronic exchange.

It could be very valuable to provide a trader with the opportunity to trade tradeable objects listed at different electronic exchanges. For example a trader could view market information from each tradeable object through one common visual display. As such price and quantity information from the two separate exchanges may be presented together so that the trader can view both markets simultaneously in the same window. In another example a trader can spread trade different tradeable objects listed at the different electronic exchanges.

The second method that is often used to connect network segments in an electronic trading environment is a remote connection. illustrates an example electronic trading system in which a trading station is located remote from a gateway. The example system comprises a remote trading station a remote host a gateway and an exchange . A trader connecting in a remote mode connects to the remote host located at a site that hosts the gateway via the Internet or through a direct connection. Example connections between the remote trading station and the remote host include an ISDN cable DSL or a least line connection. The remote host and the gateway may communicate via a LAN.

In the remote mode of operation the remote trading station initiates a connection to the remote host by establishing a Transmission Control Protocol TCP session. It should be understood that different protocols could be used as well. When data arrives at the remote host from the gateway the remote host sends it to the client terminal via the established TCP connection.

While two example trading systems have been described above it should be understood that different network connection are possible as well and the example embodiments are not limited to the described systems. For example another example trading system could be configured to use Wide Area Networks WAN and WAN routers. One skilled in the art of electronic trading systems will understand that the present embodiments are not limited to the particular configurations illustrated and described with respect to and will be able to design a particular system based on the specific requirements for example by adding additional exchanges gateways trading stations routers or other computers serving various functions like message handling and security . Additionally several networks like either of the networks shown in may be linked together to access one or more electronic exchanges.

Preferably the charting application has access to market data from one or more host electronic exchanges through an interface such as the API . When the charting application receives market data from the host exchange it arranges and displays the received data on a chart that a trader may view on a visual output display device . Example display devices include CRT based video displays LCD based displays gas plasma panel displays displays that show three dimensional images different display types or the combination thereof.

The chart based order entry application allows for order entry via a chart as will be explained in greater detail below. In short the chart based order entry application generates an order entry interface to be displayed in relation to a chart. According to one example embodiment the order entry interface takes a format similar to a pie chart interface with a plurality of objects or slices of the pie chart interface dynamically displaying a set of market price levels determined based on the position of the pie chart interface in relation to the chart. As will be described in greater detail below a user may select one of the prices displayed in relation to the pie chart interface to effectively set a price for a trade order to buy or sell a tradeable object and to send the trade order to an electronic exchange.

The chart based order entry application interacts with a trading application such as X TRADER referenced above so that when an order is entered using the chart based order entry methods the order may be sent to an electronic exchange by the trading application. It should be understood that according to one example embodiment the chart based order entry application could be an internal module of any trading application. Alternatively the chart based order entry interface may be programmed so that there is no need to interact with any trading applications.

The charting application and the chart based order entry application receive input signals from a trader via input devices . Example input devices include a mouse a keyboard a game pad or a stylus in the systems using touch screen display devices. However different input devices or a combination of input devices could also be used. For example input signals received from a user may include an input in relation to a chart to enter a trade order to an electronic exchange the methods of which will be described below.

The operating system is used to manage hardware and software resources of the client terminal . General functions of the operating system include among others processor management memory management device management storage management as well as application interfaces and user interface management. Any type of operating system may be used to implement the present embodiments and examples of common operating systems include the Microsoft WINDOWS family operating systems the UNIX family operating systems or the MACINTOSH operating systems. However those ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that the added complexity of an operating system may not be necessary to perform the functions described herein.

The diagram also illustrates an order entry interface displayed in relation to the chart . The order entry interface illustrated in takes a format of a wedge or pie chart like interface having a plurality of selectable price based objects that are divided into a first set corresponding to a first half of the interface and a second set corresponding to a second half of the interface . According to the illustrated example embodiment the interface objects shown at and display an expanded view of price levels that are determined based on a location of the order entry interface in relation to the chart . More specifically the first and second portions and display an identical set of a plurality of price levels with the left half of the interface representing bid prices and the right half representing ask prices. It should be understood that a reverse configuration could be used as well and the displayed price levels could be color coded based on the user s preferences. For example blue could be used to color code bid prices and red could be used to color code ask prices. However different colors and configurations could be used as well. Additionally while a ring like or pie like structure is illustrated in relation to the interface it should be understood that many different shapes could be used as well such as any arc shaped interfaces or an interface having the price objects positioned in relation to vertical or horizontal columns. Many different interfaces using different curvature angles are possible as well.

Price levels displayed at and dynamically change based on a location of the interface in relation to the chart . According to one example embodiment a cursor may be displayed at a center point of the order entry interface such as shown at and as the cursor is moved along the chart the position of the cursor at some point directly on the chart or off the chart determines a set of prices that are displayed via the interface . In the example embodiment of the interface displays eight price levels in each half of the interface . In such an embodiment one of the objects close to the center of each half of the interface may be used as a reference price object that corresponds to a price level that maps to a position of a cursor at in relation to the chart .

According to the example embodiment shown in the price object that displays a price level of is a reference price object and the three upper objects display three higher price levels and the four lower objects display four lower price levels. It should be understood that any price object could be configured to be a reference price object and represent a price levels that corresponds to a location of the cursor in relation to the chart. Additionally price levels displayed in relation to the reference price object could be displayed in the reverse order with the prices lower than a price at the reference price object being displayed in relation to the top price objects and prices higher than the price of the reference price object being displayed in the lower price objects such as illustrated in relation to an order entry interface shown in . Also while the prices displayed in relation to the reference price object use a single increment price value different configurations using different increment values are possible as well.

It should be understood that different configurations of the interface are possible as well with any other price object than the center object of the interface corresponding to the price that matches the position of the cursor . Additionally any other configuration could be used in relation to the prices surrounding the selected price such as for example displaying only lower price levels higher price levels or yet displaying a combination of higher and lower price levels at some other locations than the locations shown in and . Also it should be understood that while each half and of the interface displays eight price levels fewer or more price levels could be displayed as well based on user s preferences or based on a hard coded configuration. According to yet another example embodiment a second ring with additional price levels could be displayed as well.

As explained earlier the order entry interface tracks the movement of a user input device. When a user moves a cursor thus moving the interface in relation to the chart the prices displayed via the interface dynamically change based on the location of the cursor in relation to the chart . illustrates a change in the displayed price levels as the interface has been moved to a new location as shown at A with the interface now shown at A. As shown in relation to the interface A the new location of the cursor corresponds to the price level of with lower and higher price levels displayed below and above the reference object of each half of the interface A respectively. Also as shown in relation to the interface A the location of the cursor does not correspond to any point on the chart . Regardless the location of the cursor is mapped to a price level on the price axis.

According to one example embodiment a user can freeze the prices displayed in relation to the order entry interface to enter trade orders to buy or sell a tradeable object for which data is displayed via the chart . It should be understood that any predefined user input could freeze the prices. According to one example embodiment using a mouse as a user input device a user freezes the prices displayed via the interface by selecting and holding down one of the buttons of the mouse. Then to enter an order the user moves the cursor with the mouse button depressed down to an interface object corresponding to a desired price. According to the example embodiment described earlier where the left half of the interface is a bid side and the right half is an ask side a user may move the cursor to a price level on the bid side to place a buy order and to a price level on the ask side to place a sell order. In the embodiment where the button down action freezes the price levels displayed via the interface a user could position the cursor at a desired price and release the pressed down button over an interface object corresponding to the desired price to place a trade order to buy or sell at the desired price. In such an embodiment a user may cancel an order entry process by simply releasing the mouse button outside any interface object displayed via the interface . According to another example embodiment a click release mouse action could be first used in relation to a desired price level to freeze the interface and then another click release action could be used in relation to the desired price object to place an order.

Additionally as new data is received for display in relation to the chart the chart will be scrolling to the left to allow for display of new data points in relation to the chart . In one example embodiment the interface may scroll with the chart . To prevent any price changes displayed via the interface at the time when a user initiates an order a user input action initiated an order entry could freeze the price levels displayed via the interface and may also prevent any automated chart rescaling for a time period until an initiated order action is completed or an order action is cancelled. Different embodiments where the auto scrolling feature is disabled are possible as well.

It should be understood that different embodiments could also be used for order entry. For example any predefined user action such a selection of a specific key on a keyboard or a combination of keys may freeze price levels displayed via the interface . Then once the prices displayed via the interface freeze a selection of a desired price level via one of the interface objects results in placing an order to buy or sell order.

Additionally a user may preset a default order quantity to be used in relation to any order that is entered via the interface . Alternatively a quantity interface could be displayed either in relation to the interface so that a user could selectively choose a desired quantity or the interface could be designed to allow a user select a desired quantity as shown in the next figure.

According to one example embodiment a user can select a default quantity by simply clicking on a quantity object corresponding to the desired quantity before initiating an order entry process. As shown in the highlighted quantity objects correspond to default quantities set for buy and sell orders with a quantity of 10 set for buys and a quantity of 5 set for sells. According to one example embodiment the quantity ring may rotate to align a default quantity with a current position of a cursor in relation to one of the price levels displayed via the interface. For example if a cursor hovers over the price level of the quantity ring rotates such that the quantity of 5 is aligned with the price level of . If the cursor is then moved to a price level of the outer quantity ring may rotate again such that the quantity of 5 is aligned with the price level of . 

It should be understood that while illustrates five examples of buy and sell quantities different quantities could also be used based on the user s preferences. For example a user may select a quantity object to activate an interface that enables the user to change a quantity value for the selected quantity object or other quantity objects. Also while the interface displays a separate set of quantities for buy and sell orders it should be understood that a common set of quantity objects may be used as well to set quantities for both buy or sell orders. Also according to yet another example embodiment only a single default quantity is displayed or each price is assigned to its own quantity value that is displayed in relation to each price. Those skilled in the art will understand that many different embodiments are possible as well.

According to one example embodiment in addition to enabling a user to enter orders at desired price levels selected based on a position of a cursor in relation to a chart the example order entry interface also allows for viewing current market conditions in relation to the displayed prices. For example as shown in market depth data is graphically displayed in relation to some or all prices displayed via the interface depending on the current market activity corresponding to the tradeable object in relation to one or more displayed price levels. According to one example embodiment if one of the displayed price levels corresponds to the inside market an indicator is used to alert a user of the current location of the inside market. For example the price levels corresponding to the inside market could be highlighted however different indicators could also be used.

In the embodiment illustrated in current market depth data are displayed in relation to each price using bars where each bar represents a quantity pending at the price. It should be understood that the length of each bar may be scaled based on a predefined scale so that a user can easily view the relative quantity values pending at each price level. In addition to having the bars scaled quantity values at market depth prices and inside market prices could be displayed in relation to each bar. It should be understood that depending on the position of the interface in relation to a chart if no quantities are available at a displayed price level no bar would be displayed in relation to such price level. Also quantity bars corresponding to bid prices are displayed in relation to prices on the bid side portion of the interface here the left side and quantity bars corresponding to ask prices are displayed in relation to prices on the ask side of the interface here the right side. In the embodiment illustrated in based on the position of the bars a user can quickly determine that the current inside market is at price levels and with the best bid price at and the best ask price at .

It should be understood that the bars illustrated in may not necessarily be radial with respect to each price object of the interface. is a block diagram illustrating yet another example order entry interface that displays current market conditions according to another arrangement. In the embodiment illustrated in the market bars are aligned horizontally with the price objects displayed via the interface.

While illustrates an embodiment related to displaying market data in relation the interface it should be understood that different market related data such as total traded volume at each price level could be displayed as well. Additionally the example embodiments could also incorporate trader related data. For example when the interface displays a price level at which a user has a pending working order a working order indicator is displayed in relation to the price level. It should be understood that many different formats of working order indicators could be used including displaying an indicator directly next to a price in an interface object or having a separate ring with working order objects that display more detailed working order data. For example according to the example embodiment where bid and ask prices are divided any buy working order indicators could be displayed in relation to bid price objects and ask working order indicators could be displayed directly next to ask price objects. Different embodiments are possible as well.

It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the methods described above may be embodied in a computer program product that includes one or more computer readable media. For example a computer readable medium can include a readable memory device such as a hard drive device a CD ROM a DVD ROM or a computer diskette having computer readable program code segments stored thereon. The computer readable medium can also include a communications or transmission medium such as a bus or a communication link either optical wired or wireless having program code segments carried thereon as digital or analog data signals.

The claims should not be read as limited to the described order or elements unless stated to that effect. Therefore all embodiments that come within the scope and spirit of the following claims and equivalents thereto are claimed as the invention.
