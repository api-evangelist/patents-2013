However as described above in the prior art each time the user wants to newly connect a BLUETOOTH device to a mobile terminal with no BLUETOOTH device connected thereto or to switch from the BLUETOOTH device connected to the mobile terminal to another BLUETOOTH device in the prior art the user has been annoyingly required to manipulate the mobile terminal directly to establish a new connection to the BLUETOOTH device or to switch to another BLUETOOTH device.

Accordingly the present invention makes it possible to automatically connect a BLUETOOTH device registered in advance by a user to a mobile terminal . In particular the present invention makes it possible to automatically connect a plurality of BLUETOOTH devices to a mobile terminal selectively depending on the priorities of each of the devices registered in the mobile terminal . In addition the present invention makes it possible to automatically switch a connection of a mobile terminal to a plurality of BLUETOOTH devices depending on the priorities of each of the devices registered in the mobile terminal .

The wireless communication unit transmits and receives wireless signals for mobile communication of the mobile terminal under control of the controller . The BLUETOOTH module performs BLUETOOTH communication with BLUETOOTH devices in the vicinity of the mobile terminal under control of the controller . The audio I O unit inputs and outputs various sounds such as voice or audio from audio files associated with operations of the mobile terminal and or the controller . The memory stores a program for operations of the controller and stores various data generated during execution of operations of terminal and or the controller . The memory may further include an external memory and may also include a storage device such as Hard Disk Drive HDD . The display displays images generated by operations of the controller . The key input unit provides various key inputs needed for operations of the mobile terminal input from the user to the controller . The key input unit may include a touch screen panel mounted on or included in the display and may include numeric character keys for inputting numeric character information and function keys for setting various functions. The controller controls the overall operation of the mobile terminal . In accordance with the exemplary embodiment of the present invention the controller connects BLUETOOTH devices to the mobile terminal using the BLUETOOTH module of the mobile terminal .

Referring to if the user selects a priority registration menu using the key input unit the controller displays the priority registration menu on the display in response thereto in step . The priority registration menu is a menu which is added to the common menus provided by the mobile terminal according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention and may be added as an item of the common BLUETOOTH setting menu. The priority registration menu may include user selectable choices and functions such as Additionally Register Priority Change Priority and Release Priority . Thereafter in steps to the controller receives one of Additionally Register Priority Change Priority and Release Priority respectively selected by the user based on inputs from the user through the key input unit .

The user may additionally register priorities of new BLUETOOTH devices or may change or release priorities of registered BLUETOOTH devices while the priority registration menu is displayed. Using the key input unit the user may select one of Additionally Register Priority Change Priority and Release Priority and then may register new BLUETOOTH devices in the priority list and set priorities thereof or may change or release priorities of the registered BLUETOOTH devices. It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that in a mobile terminal a user s additionally registering changing and releasing priorities of BLUETOOTH devices in an available and displayed editable list may be achieved by for example touching or inputting a predetermined icon or number on the key input unit and or a touch screen of the display using a graphic user interface GUI in a manner known in the art. A more detailed description thereof is omitted herein.

Referring back to if the user selects Additionally Register Priority in step the controller performs step in response to the selection otherwise the process proceeds to step . In step the controller displays a list of paired BLUETOOTH devices. The list of paired BLUETOOTH devices is defined as a list of BLUETOOTH devices paired to the mobile terminal and is stored in the memory by the controller . Next in step the controller adds BLUETOOTH devices selected by the user from among the BLUETOOTH devices in the list of paired BLUETOOTH devices to the priority list. In step the controller sets priorities of the BLUETOOTH devices added to the priority list depending on the user s input. For example if the user additionally registers a priority of the BLUETOOTH headset or BT Headset and sets a priority thereof as 3 while the BLUETOOTH speaker or BT Speaker is already registered with a priority of 1 and the BLUETOOTH car kit or BT Carkit is already registered with a priority of 2 as shown in then the priority registration results are changed to have the appearance of the priority list shown on the priority registration menu of .

If the user selects Change Priority in step the controller performs step in response to the selection otherwise the process proceeds to step . In step the controller changes priorities of priority registered BLUETOOTH devices i.e. BLUETOOTH devices in the priority list depending on the user s input. For example if the user exchanges priorities of the BLUETOOTH car kit or BT Carkit and the BLUETOOTH headset or BT Headset while the BLUETOOTH speaker or BT Speaker is already registered with a priority of 1 the BLUETOOTH car kit or BT Carkit is registered with a priority of 2 and the BLUETOOTH headset or BT Headset is already registered with a priority of 3 as shown in then the priority registration results are changed to have the appearance of the priority list shown on the priority registration menu of .

If the user selects Release Priority in step the controller performs step in response to the selection otherwise the process loops back to step . In step the controller releases priorities by deleting from the priority list BLUETOOTH devices designated by the user among the priority registered BLUETOOTH devices i.e. BLUETOOTH devices in the priority list. For example if the user releases a priority of the BLUETOOTH headset or BT Headset while the BLUETOOTH speaker or BT Speaker is already registered with a priority of 1 the BLUETOOTH car kit or BT Carkit is already registered with a priority of 2 and the BLUETOOTH headset or BT Headset is already registered with a priority of 3 as shown in then the priority registration results are changed to have the appearance of the priority list shown on the priority registration menu of .

After performing steps to if a Save icon on the priority registration menus of is touched by the user the controller terminates the priority registration process after saving the priority list in response to the touch in step and the process of ends. Otherwise the controller returns to step . If a Back icon on the priority registration menus of is touched by the user during execution of steps to the controller returns to the previous step.

The term connectable BLUETOOTH device as used herein may refer to a BLUETOOTH device that exists in the vicinity of the mobile terminal is powered on and approaches the mobile terminal within a distance where establishment of a BLUETOOTH communication with the mobile terminal is possible. The connectable BLUETOOTH device may be detected in two different ways. In a first case to search for a BLUETOOTH device in the vicinity of the mobile terminal the controller may transmit an advertising event and detect a BLUETOOTH device responding thereto using the BLUETOOTH module . In a second case the controller may detect an advertising event that a BLUETOOTH device in the vicinity of the mobile terminal periodically transmits by BLUETOOTH scanning using the BLUETOOTH module thereby detecting a connectable BLUETOOTH device. In accordance with the exemplary embodiment of the present invention since the mobile terminal automatically continues to detect BLUETOOTH devices it is preferable that the mobile terminal detects BLUETOOTH devices based on the BLUETOOTH Specification Version 4.0 Low Energy LE technology to reduce its power consumption.

In step the controller determines whether there is any priority registered BLUETOOTH device among the detected BLUETOOTH devices. If the controller determines in step that there is no priority registered BLUETOOTH device the controller again performs step and its successive steps. Otherwise if the controller determines in step that there is a priority registered BLUETOOTH device among the detected BLUETOOTH devices the controller performs step . In step the controller connects with the highest priority BLUETOOTH device among the detected BLUETOOTH devices using the BLUETOOTH module .

A description follows of a case for example where the user enters the home environment shown in carrying the mobile terminal with him or her with no BLUETOOTH device connected to the mobile terminal . If the BLUETOOTH headset and the BLUETOOTH speaker whose priorities are registered as in are powered on and the BLUETOOTH headset and the BLUETOOTH speaker exist within a distance where the devices can perform BLUETOOTH communication with the mobile terminal then the BLUETOOTH headset and the BLUETOOTH speaker will be detected in step .

Since the BLUETOOTH speaker is higher in priority than the BLUETOOTH headset the controller may connect with the BLUETOOTH speaker . Accordingly if the user enters the home environment carrying the mobile terminal with him or her with no BLUETOOTH device connected to the mobile terminal the user may use the BLUETOOTH speaker without separately manipulating the mobile terminal as the BLUETOOTH speaker is automatically connected to the mobile terminal .

In some cases the BLUETOOTH speaker may have been powered off when the user enters the home environment . In this case if the user simply turns on power of the BLUETOOTH speaker after entering the home environment carrying the mobile terminal with him or her the BLUETOOTH speaker may be automatically connected to the mobile terminal even though the user does not separately manipulate the mobile terminal to establish the connection.

With reference to the description of the home environment those of ordinary skill in the art may easily understand that connections of the mobile terminal to other devices in the pedestrian environment and the vehicle environment shown in are substantially similar or identical to the above description of the establishment of the connection of the mobile terminal to other devices in the home environment . Therefore a description of connection in a case where the user enters the pedestrian environment or the vehicle environment with no BLUETOOTH device connected to the mobile terminal will be omitted.

In step the controller determines whether there is any priority registered BLUETOOTH device among the detected BLUETOOTH devices. If the controller determines in step that there is no priority registered BLUETOOTH device the controller again performs step and its successive steps. Accordingly the controller continues to detect priority registered BLUETOOTH devices while maintaining its connection with the currently connected BLUETOOTH device. In contrast if the controller determines in step that there is a priority registered BLUETOOTH device the controller performs step .

In step the controller determines whether there is any BLUETOOTH device higher in priority than the currently connected BLUETOOTH device among the detected BLUETOOTH devices. If there is a BLUETOOTH device whose priority is higher than that of the currently connected BLUETOOTH device among the detected BLUETOOTH devices the controller proceeds to step . The currently connected BLUETOOTH device may be a BLUETOOTH device whose priority is not registered. In this case the currently connected BLUETOOTH device is regarded as a BLUETOOTH device whose priority is lower than that of the lowest priority BLUETOOTH device among the priority registered BLUETOOTH devices. In step the controller switches its connection to the highest priority BLUETOOTH device among the detected BLUETOOTH devices using the BLUETOOTH module and then again performs step and its successive steps.

However if the controller determines in step that there is no BLUETOOTH device which is higher in priority than the currently connected BLUETOOTH device among the detected BLUETOOTH devices i.e. if the currently connected BLUETOOTH device is higher in priority than the detected BLUETOOTH device the controller again performs step and its successive steps. Accordingly if the currently connected BLUETOOTH device is higher in priority than the detected BLUETOOTH device the controller continues to detect priority registered BLUETOOTH devices while maintaining its connection with the currently connected BLUETOOTH device.

For example in a case where the user enters the home environment shown in carrying the mobile terminal and the BLUETOOTH headset with him or her with the BLUETOOTH headset connected to the mobile terminal if the BLUETOOTH speaker whose priority is registered as in is powered on and the BLUETOOTH speaker exists within a distance where the speaker can establish a BLUETOOTH communication with the mobile terminal the BLUETOOTH speaker will be detected in step .

Then the controller will switch its connection from the BLUETOOTH headset to the BLUETOOTH speaker because the BLUETOOTH speaker is higher in priority than the BLUETOOTH headset . Accordingly if the user enters the home environment while listening to music outside the home using the BLUETOOTH headset connected to the mobile terminal the user may continue to listen to the music using the BLUETOOTH speaker instead of the BLUETOOTH headset without separately manipulating the mobile terminal because the BLUETOOTH speaker is automatically connected to the mobile terminal .

In some cases the BLUETOOTH speaker may have been powered off when the user enters the home environment . In this case if the user simply turns on power of the BLUETOOTH speaker after entering the home environment carrying the mobile terminal with him or her the connection will be automatically switched from the BLUETOOTH headset to the BLUETOOTH speaker even though the user does not separately manipulate the mobile terminal .

With reference to the description of the home environment those of ordinary skill in the art may easily understand that connection for switching in the vehicle environment shown in is substantially similar or identical to the above description of the establishment of the switching in the home environment . Therefore a description of connection switching in a case where the user enters the vehicle environment with a BLUETOOTH device connected to the mobile terminal will be omitted. No connection switching may occur in the pedestrian environment shown in because in the example of the pedestrian environment there is only one priority registered BLUETOOTH device i.e. the BLUETOOTH headset .

If the controller determines in step that there is a priority registered BLUETOOTH device among the detected BLUETOOTH devices the controller performs steps and before step . In step the controller outputs a connection confirmation message on the display . The connection confirmation message is a message for notifying the user of the detection of a high priority BLUETOOTH device and allowing the user to determine whether to connect with the detected BLUETOOTH device using the key input unit . For example the connection confirmation message may be output in a pop up form such as a text window with a wording You have a high priority BLUETOOTH device available. Do you want to connect with it and the window may also display icons labeled Connect or Ignore . After outputting the connection confirmation message the controller determines in step whether the user selects Connect . If the user selects Connect the controller proceeds to step . Otherwise if the user does not select Connect the controller ends the process.

If the controller determines in step that there is a BLUETOOTH device whose priority is higher than that of the currently connected BLUETOOTH device among the detected BLUETOOTH devices the control performs steps and before step . In step the controller outputs a connection confirmation message on the display in a similar manner as in step of . After outputting the connection confirmation message the controller determines in step whether the user selects Connect . If the user selects Connect the controller proceeds to step . Otherwise if the user does not select Connect the controller returns to step .

In step the controller determines whether the mobile terminal has been connected to another BLUETOOTH device other than the BLUETOOTH device from which the mobile terminal has disconnected. For this determination step the controller stores and updates the connection history of BLUETOOTH devices in the memory . If the mobile terminal has never been connected to another BLUETOOTH device the controller proceeds to step . In steps to as in the above described steps to in upon detecting a priority registered BLUETOOTH device the controller connects with the highest priority BLUETOOTH device among the detected BLUETOOTH devices using the BLUETOOTH module and then returns to step .

However if the controller determines in step that the mobile terminal has been connected to another BLUETOOTH device the controller proceeds to step . Upon detecting in step another BLUETOOTH device having been connected before the controller connects with the detected BLUETOOTH device using the BLUETOOTH module in step and then returns to step . Otherwise upon detecting no another BLUETOOTH device having been connected before the controller proceeds to step . In implementations of the present invention even though the controller may determine in step that the mobile terminal has been connected to another BLUETOOTH device if the BLUETOOTH device having been connected before is not a priority registered BLUETOOTH device the controller may proceed to step instead of step .

Therefore even if a priority registered BLUETOOTH device which has been connected to the mobile terminal is disconnected from the mobile terminal the mobile terminal may automatically connect with another connectable BLUETOOTH device without requiring the user s separate manipulation of the mobile terminal for connection with a BLUETOOTH device.

While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain exemplary embodiments thereof it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. For example even in the fifth embodiment shown in the controller may output a connection confirmation message to allow the user to determine whether he or she will select Connect before steps and or as described in connection with . Although the first to fifth embodiments have been described separately any combination of the first to fifth embodiments may be applied to the mobile terminal in implementing the present invention.

As is apparent from the foregoing description the present invention makes it possible to automatically connect a BLUETOOTH device registered in advance by a user to a mobile terminal In particular the present invention makes it possible to automatically connect a plurality of BLUETOOTH devices to a mobile terminal selectively depending on their own priorities registered in the mobile terminal.

In addition the present invention makes it possible to automatically switch a connection of a mobile terminal to a plurality of BLUETOOTH devices depending on their own priorities registered in the mobile terminal

As a result a user of a mobile terminal supporting BLUETOOTH features may establish a BLUETOOTH connection or switch the BLUETOOTH connection without requiring the user to manipulate the mobile terminal each time he or she wants to establish a BLUETOOTH connection or to switch the BLUETOOTH connection so the user may use or enjoy the BLUETOOTH features more conveniently. In particular amid the increasing use of BLUETOOTH devices such as BLUETOOTH headsets and BLUETOOTH speakers due to an increase in the number of users of mobile terminals such as tablet PCs the proposed BLUETOOTH connection may help improve the use flexibility of BLUETOOTH devices to agree with the mobility of mobile terminals.

The above described apparatus and methods according to the present invention can be implemented in hardware firmware or as software or computer code that can be stored in a recording medium such as a CD ROM a RAM a ROM a floppy disk DVDs a hard disk a magnetic storage media an optical recording media or a magneto optical disk or computer code downloaded over a network originally stored on a remote recording medium a computer readable recording medium or a non transitory machine readable medium and to be stored on a local recording medium so that the methods described herein can be rendered in such software that is stored on the recording medium using a general purpose computer a digital computer or a special processor or in programmable or dedicated hardware such as an ASIC or FPGA. As would be understood in the art the computer the processor microprocessor controller or the programmable hardware include memory components e.g. RAM ROM Flash etc. that may store or receive software or computer code that when accessed and executed by the computer processor or hardware implement the processing methods described herein. In addition it would be recognized that when a general purpose computer accesses code for implementing the processing shown herein the execution of the code transforms the general purpose computer into a special purpose computer for executing the processing shown herein. In addition the program may be electronically transferred through any media such as communication signals transmitted by wire wireless connections and their equivalents.

The BLUETOOTH connection method of the present invention may be created in a program and stored in storage media. A mobile terminal supporting BLUETOOTH may be used for establishing a BLUETOOTH connection by downloading a program or application for controlling a BLUETOOTH connection according to the present invention from a remote program server installing the downloaded program and running the installed program. In other words if a program for establishing or using a BLUETOOTH connection is installed in a mobile terminal the program runs in the mobile terminal enabling the establishment or use of the BLUETOOTH connection. Upon receiving a transmission request for the program from the mobile terminal the program server provides the program to the mobile terminal in response to the transmission request. The program server may determine whether the mobile terminal having requested transmission of the program has subscribed to the service and whether a user of the mobile terminal is authorized and check payment information of the mobile terminal. The program server may include storage media storing the program. The storage media may be located either inside or outside of the program server.

Therefore the spirit and scope of the present invention should not be limited to the description of exemplary embodiments of the present invention but should be defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.
