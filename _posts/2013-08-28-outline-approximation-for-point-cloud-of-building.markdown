Building information models BIM are being increasingly used throughout a building s lifecycle in the Architecture Engineering and Construction AEC industry. BIM models can be used for many purposes from planning and visualization in the design phase to inspection during the construction phase and to energy efficiency analysis and security planning during the facility management phase. However no design BIM exists for most existing buildings. Further the BIM created at design time may vary significantly from what is actually built. As a result there is an increasing interest in creating BIMs of the actual as built building.

Laser scanners are rapidly gaining acceptance as a tool for 3D modeling and analysis in the architecture engineering and construction AEC domain. With technological development evolution laser scanners are capable of acquiring range measurements at rates of tens to hundreds of thousands of points per second at distances of up to a few hundred meters and with measurement error on the scale of millimeters Huber 2010 which make them well suited to densely capturing the as built information of building interiors and exteriors. Usually multiple scans are needed to capture the point cloud of a whole building. Laser scanners are placed in various locations throughout and around a building. The scans from each location are registered and aligned to form a point cloud in a common coordinate system.

Currently as built BIMs are mostly created interactively form the point cloud data from laser scanners. This creation process is labor intensive and error prone. Software tools for processing point clouds have attempted to improve the ability to handle the enormous point clouds produced by laser scanners and to integrate the use of point cloud data into BIM modeling software. Geometric surface or volumetric primitives can be fitted to the 3D point cloud to model walls floors ceilings columns beams and other structures of interest.

In view of the above it may be desirable to model a polyline boundary of points from a building scan. However a boundary determination based on points obtained via a scan of a building is a crucial and difficult step in the building reconstruction task. One reason for the difficulty is that laser scanners have some difficulty in the as built environment to capture low reflectance surfaces e.g. anything painted black specular surfaces e.g. shiny metal and mirrors and transparent or translucent surfaces e.g. windows which results in the presence of concavity in the building boundary Huber 2010 . Moreover point clouds are often composed of multiple scans with noise and points of non uniform point density which will also cause difficulty in a boundary determination. Such problems may be better understood with an explanation of prior art techniques that have attempted boundary extraction.

One category of boundary extraction is purely based on computational geometry methods. Jarvis 1977 modifies the convex hull formation algorithm to limit the searching space to a certain neighborhood. However this approach is not very successful in experiments because the distribution of the used points is far from even. Edelsbrunner 1994 described a so called alpha shape determination algorithm where the shape of a point set is defined as the intersection of all closed discs with radii. This method is computationally complex and its performance depends on the parameter alpha. Although methods for line simplification such as Douglas Peucker can be applied during the generalization process this category of boundary extraction methods doesn t take the regular shape characteristics existing in most common buildings into consideration and thus cannot generate satisfying outline results that can be used for as built building modeling.

In the last few decades considerable research effort has been directed toward mainly building outline generation but most of the prior art is focused on reconstructing building models using aerial imagery and airborne laser scanning data.

In order to generalize the building outline Maas Vosselman 1999 determined the ridge line as a horizontal intersection between roof faces and then use the direction of the ridge line as an approximation for the main direction of the building. Dutter 2007 starts with an MBR Minimum Bounding Rectangle and determines relevant deviations from the rectangle lines. This is done recursively thus enabling different shapes of buildings like L T or U shaped outlines which limits the generality of Dutter s method. Shan Sampath 2007 use straight lines in the main direction of the buildings to approximate the shape and then use least squares adjustment for the adaptation to the original boundary points. Sester and Neidhart 2008 employ a RANSAC RANdom Sample Consensus method to generate a set of initial line hypotheses firstly and the hypotheses are refined using a least squares adjustment process in which the segments are shifted to fit the original shape and to enforce relations between segments.

 Jwa et al. 2008 rectified noisy polyline by re arranging quantized line slopes in a local shape configuration and globally selecting optimal outlines based on the Minimum Description Length principles. Dorninger and Pfeifer 2008 define a coarse approximation of the outline by the computation of a 2D alpha shape of all the given points and the post processing of the alpha shape polygon by a generalization and regularization process. Guercke and Sester 2011 sample the outline of the polygon into small line segments in a first step and then transform the line segments into Hough space. The lines corresponding to the peaks in the Hough buffer are used to generate initial hypotheses for the polygon outline which is refined by a least squared adjustment procedure to enforce parallel or perpendicular segments.

In view of the above it is desirable to extract determine boundaries from building point cloud data in an easy and efficient manner.

Embodiments of the invention provide a method to model a polyline boundary of points from a building scan. The extracted polyline can be used to model outlines of an entire building or floors and ceilings. To make the boundary extraction process robust for different kinds of point source the boundary cells are extracted roughly by a flood filling method. Thereafter the potential boundary points in the boundary cells are filtered through a modified convex hull. Line segments may then be extracted from the boundary points. The line segments are then refined under the constraints of parallel and perpendicular segments which is quite common for elements existing in buildings. Finally a regularized polygon is obtained by intersecting the refined line segments.

Embodiments of the invention are implemented as a software application on a client or server computer . Further as described above the client or server computer may comprise a thin client device or a portable device that has a multi touch based display and that may comprise or may be coupled to or receive data from a 3D laser scanning device .

At step the boundary cells are roughly extracted from the point cloud data e.g. using a flood filling boundary filling method . As described in further detail below such a flood filling method may subdivide a 2D bounding box of the point cloud data along an x direction and a y direction to form one or more rectangular grids having one or more grid cells. Thereafter points from the point cloud are distributed to the grid cells and steps are performed to ensure that gird cells that are in a most exterior loop of the grid cells are empty cells.

At step potential boundary points in the boundary cells are filtered e.g. through a modified convex hull as described in further detail below .

At step the extracted line segments are refined e.g. under the constraints of parallel and perpendicular segments .

Step provides for obtaining point cloud data to be used for extracting a boundary . The points for boundary extraction can be obtained from different sources including points that represent building outlines floor surfaces and wall surfaces. Due to the reality that laser scanners have difficulty in capturing low reflectance surfaces specular surfaces and transparent or translucent surfaces point cloud data may include holes from surfaces such as very dark walls and glass windows. As a result a building outline that should be closed e.g. a closed polygon becomes open in real cases. Additionally points obtained from most laser scanners may have non uniform point density. Consequently when a uniform grid structure is used to organize the points from laser scanners adjacent laser scanning points may be distributed into non neighboring cells in the grid. To overcome such a problem some prior art techniques have attempted to adjust the grid size. However defining a proper size grid is difficult if not impossible when attempting to avoid this kind of problem. Embodiments of the invention provide a boundary approximation method that attempts to carefully handle the above described problems.

Step of provides for roughly extracting the boundary cells. Such an extraction results in potential cells that may include potential boundary points needed to approximate the outline. illustrates details regarding the extraction of potential boundary points from the boundary cells in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. illustrates the grid structure for the boundary filling process to detect the potential boundary cells in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.

To extract the potential boundary points the two dimensional 2D point cloud data are organized in a 2D grid structure . To organize the point cloud data a 2D bounding box of the point cloud data is subdivided along the x and y directions to form some rectangular grids at step .

At step the points are distributed to each cell in the grid. In addition the dimension of a grid cell can be adaptively set to be a multiple of the predefined threshold of discontinuity according to the memory capacity. The grid cell dimension can be set based on a user s knowledge about the data precision or based on a multiple of the estimated mean distance. For some 32 bit systems the total grid size might be too big and cause out of memory problems. In this case one can gradually increase the cell dimension to make the total grid size accommodate the memory size according to the following pseudo code.

At step empty and non empty cells are identified. In this regard any cell with one or more points inside is named as a Non Empty Cell while any cell without any points inside is named as an Empty Cell.

At step to make sure that the cells in the most exterior loop are empty cells the grid may be enlarged by expanding one cell along each direction of the grid.

At step the exterior boundary cells are extracted. In one or more embodiments with the above defined regular grid structure a boundary filling method can be used to extract the exterior boundary cells. Starting from the seed background cell e.g. cell 0 0 the boundary filling process or the boundary cell identification process iteratively continues until a non empty cell is encountered i.e. a cell containing one or more points . In this regard beginning with the seed cell a check is performed to determine if the seed cell contains any points. If it contains points it is identified as a boundary cell . The function is then called iteratively on cells neighboring the seed cell . The function may be executed for either the 4 connected neighbors i.e. left right top and bottom or 9 connected neighbors i.e. the four connected neighbors as well as the diagonal neighbors . The four connected boundary filling approach may be used to prevent a background cell from propagating into the interior bounded by the boundary cells . In addition a stack based boundary filling instead of recursive boundary filling may be used to prevent stack overflow e.g. because the area a building footprint covers might be huge .

Although the 4 connected boundary filling method can find most of the boundary cells there are still some cells with boundary points missing. illustrates the expansion of boundary cells that span across 8 connected boundary cells in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. As illustrated the boundary outlines may span two 8 connected boundary cells A C and go across an interior non empty cell see left side of . Thereafter more boundary cells may be added by further checking the existing boundary cells A D.

After the boundary cells are extracted all the points located in the boundary cells are marked as potential boundary points. However this set of potential boundary points is too dense and noisy to extract a polyline for the outline extraction. Accordingly a two step process may be used to filter out the unnecessary points and refine the boundary point set.

For the first step the potential boundary points are filtered by calculating the arc range of the neighboring points Wang et al 2006 . A point on the boundary should have a big arc range where no other points exist. For each potential boundary point P take all the neighboring points of this point within a radius of R with point Pas a center. Calculate the arc range of the neighboring points and find the largest angular region where no point exists. If the largest angular region where there is no existing point is larger than a threshold e.g. 70 degree this potential neighboring point is marked as boundary point. depict the largest angular region with arc lines in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. The center point in can be regarded as an interior point e.g. based on the angular region and the center point in can be regarded as a potential boundary point e.g. because the angular region exceeds a threshold .

At the second step the filtered boundary points are resampled in each cell based on the boundary grid lines. The boundary grid lines are shown as bold lines in the right side of . For each boundary grid line the point with the shortest distance to it is kept as a potential boundary point. This step further simplifies the boundary point set and makes the sampled boundary points more uniform on the boundary which benefits boundary curve generation. Some boundary points may be missing using this method. However a rough outline of the building can be constructed using the filtered boundary points.

Ideally the outline should be closed while in some cases the building outline is not closed as there are holes such as doors and windows on the walls. In this situation the boundary filling method described above will mark some cells inside the building as boundary cells . Thereafter not all the extracted boundary points lie on the real outline and the boundary points cannot be directly used for polyline extraction. An example can be demonstrated in which illustrates a hole on the boundary that will cause a problem to boundary cell detection in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.

As illustrated in if there is a hole on the outline i.e. cell is missing the boundary filling method will go through the outline and into the interior of the boundary thus marking some of the interior non empty cells as boundary cells .

As embodiments of the invention may only be concerned with the points on the outline the points inside the outline should be erased. Embodiments of the invention may utilize a modified convex hull method e.g. as proposed in Sampath Shan 2007 to approximate the outline and then use the result of the modified convex hull to filter the boundary points. As the dimension of the hole on the wall is not fixed the neighbor size may be varied from 5 to 30 to be adaptive to the point cloud. If the modified convex hull succeeds and the area of the convex hull approximates the area the building covers the modified convex hull result is regarded as a good one. All of the boundary points are revisited again only the boundary points near the modified convex hull are kept as the refined boundary points and used for the following polyline reconstruction.

At step of line segments are extracted from the refined filtered boundary points. Various methods may be used to extract the line segments.

Embodiments of the invention may use a RANSAC method to extract all the lines contained in the boundary points. As used herein RANSAC is a method that is able to find a model in a data set in a high presence of noise. Embodiments of the invention may implement RANSAC as follows RANSAC 2013 

 2 Fit a hypothesis line to selected data points i.e. all free parameters of the model are reconstructed from the inliers with the method of least square line fitting.

 3 Incrementally add neighboring points collected that fit to the hypothesis line. Note that only neighboring points are incrementally added as the assumption is that the straight line has to be formed of consecutive points. To determine whether a neighboring point fits to the hypothesis line the subset of data points whose distance to the line is smaller than a given threshold is calculated. If a point fits well to the estimated line model it is considered as a hypothetical inlier. All points with a distance larger than the threshold are considered as outliers. If enough points are in the subset the line model is re estimated from all hypothetical inliers and the subset is stored.

 4 The above described procedure is repeated for a fixed number of times each time producing either a model that is rejected because too few points are classified as inliers or producing a refined model with a corresponding error measure. After N iterations the subset that contains the most inlier points is chosen.

 5 The above process is iterated with the remaining points. After a candidate line is found an adjusted line can be calculated using all of the candidate points of that line in a regression analysis.

Each time a line is detected all of the inlier points of the line are projected onto the line and the line is segmented into several edge intervals.

For most elements of buildings the planar surface is constructed with a typical relationship between segments on the outline especially parallel and perpendicular relationships. Embodiments of the invention enable users to select an option regarding whether to retain the parallel or perpendicular relations of the line segments in the polyline reconstruction process to produce regularized outline shapes.

The direction of the longest boundary line segment detected in the RANSAC process is selected as an initial principal orientation. The subsequent lines are adjusted either parallel or orthogonal to this one orientation. The following four cases of the line segment relationship may be considered 

 1 The subsequent line segment is nearly parallel e.g. within a parallel threshold such as 5 degrees deviation to the current first line segment but the distance between the two segments is above a predefined distance threshold. If the above conditions are true the two segments are forced to be parallel e.g. by adjusting the subsequent line segment and an intermediate orthogonally oriented segment is inserted between these adjacent line segments 

 2 The subsequent line segment is nearly parallel e.g. within the parallel threshold such as 5 degrees deviation to the current first line segment and the distance between the two segments is below a predefined distance threshold. If the above conditions are true then the two line segments are both maintained but forced to be parallel and extended or trimmed to merge together 

 3 The subsequent line segment is nearly perpendicular e.g. within a perpendicular threshold such as 85 to 95 degrees to the current first line segment. If such conditions are true then the two line segments are forced to be perpendicular and linked at the intersection point 

 4 If none of the above conditions i.e. 1 3 above are satisfied a line segment is inserted to connect the adjacent points of the two line segment.

One may note that a forced regularized boundary may be accepted only if the angular deviation before and after regularization is below a threshold value. Otherwise the original boundary line may be maintained.

This concludes the description of the preferred embodiment of the invention. The following describes some alternative embodiments for accomplishing the present invention. For example any type of computer such as a mainframe minicomputer or personal computer or computer configuration such as a timesharing mainframe local area network or standalone personal computer could be used with the present invention.

As described above the dense but non uniform point characteristics of point cloud data present difficulties for a perfect outline of the points on a building outline or surfaces. Embodiments of the invention provide a method for extracting the outline of points from a building scanned by ground based laser scanners.

It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. It is intended that the scope of the invention be limited not by this detailed description but rather by the claims appended hereto.
