This application is related to PCT Patent Application No. US2005 005135 filed Feb. 18 2005 entitled CALL INTERCEPT METHODS SUCH AS FOR CUSTOMER SELF SUPPORT ON A MOBILE DEVICE PCT Patent Application No. US05 05517 filed Feb. 18 2005 entitled MOBILE DEVICE ASSISTANCE MOBILE DEVICE MANAGEMENT AND CALL INTERCEPTOR FOR MOBILE DEVICES and POT Patent Application No. US2005 033973 filed Sep. 21 2005 entitled SECURE MOBILE DEVICE SOFTWARE EXECUTION HELP SUPPORT CARE INITIATION FOR MOBILE DEVICES AND SMART NETWORK CONFIGURATION SELECTOR FOR MOBILE DEVICES.

Current methods for assisting customers at a mobile device often require a call to a call center and retrieval of data from a network. For example a subscriber may dial an information number from their mobile device such as 411 Once the subscriber dials the number an automated system may answer the call or an operator and provide the subscriber with a menu of options. The subscriber selects options from the menu by pressing buttons on the mobile device or through voice recognition software. Once the subscriber requests data by selecting an option the automated system retrieves the data from a network and delivers the data to the subscriber over the mobile device.

Problems are associated with current implementations of customer assistance for mobile devices. Many existing systems rely on the use of an external network. In provide data to the subscriber. The use of an external network for customer self support can consume a large amount of bandwidth congest the network provide for slower customer response times and lead to increased costs for the mobile device carrier. In addition the use of an automated system with multiple options can result in longer call wait times increased call costs for the mobile carrier and customer and lost customers due to the longer call wait times.

Certain terms may even be emphasized below however any terminology intended to be interpreted in any restricted manner will be overtly and specifically defined as such in this Detailed Description section.

A method for locally intercepting calls from a mobile device for providing enhanced services such as customer self support is disclosed. Subscribers may dial one or more predetermined numbers on their respective mobile device. Software on the mobile device determines whether the number corresponds to one of the predetermined numbers such as an information number . The phone provides information to the subscriber and may intercept the call when the number is dialed after the call has gone through while the call is on hold etc. For example if the number dialed matches an information number then the mobile device may interrupt the attempted call and display a list of possible solutions that address the subscriber s needs on the mobile device.

Additionally if the number dialed matches a predetermined number then the mobile device may display a list of solutions during the call that may address the subscriber s needs on the mobile device. For example during an information call or a call to a user s voicemail the system may display information related to the call or may display paths to related information for the user to choose.

The list of potential solutions may be stored locally on the mobile device itself and not on the network. Each solution can be a combination of step by step procedures for the subscriber to perform information and graphics multiple executables that access and alter data on the phone multiple executables that access and alter data on the carrier network or on a remote Internet server or others.

Other interceptions may lead to the system providing assistance to a user. The system may determine an event such as the phone taking a picture on the mobile device and provide assistance with respect to the event.

Locally stored software or scripts may also assist in diagnosing problems with other equipment. For example if customer premises equipment is unable to connect to a network to allow diagnostics to be performed the mobile device can build the needed connection instead.

Additionally the subscriber identity module or SIM card may contain any or all of the processing components memory components or storage components described herein. To that end the device may perform SIM card based processing memory or storage.

Aspects of the invention can be embodied in a special purpose computing device or data processor that is specifically programmed configured or constructed to perform one or more of the computer executable instructions explained in detail herein. Aspects of the invention may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks or modules are performed by remote processing devices which are linked through a communications network such as a Local Area Network LAN Wide Area Network WAN or the Internet. In a distributed computing environment program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.

Aspects of the invention may be stored or distributed on computer readable media including magnetically or optically readable computer discs hardwired or preprogrammed chips e.g. EEPROM semiconductor chips nanotechnology memory biological memory or other data storage media. Indeed computer implemented instructions data structures screen displays and other data under aspects of the invention may be distributed over the Internet or over other networks including wireless networks on a propagated signal on a propagation medium e.g. an electromagnetic wave s a sound wave etc. over a period of time or they may be provided on any analog or digital network packet switched circuit switched or other scheme . Those skilled in the relevant art will recognize that portions of the invention reside on a server computer while corresponding portions reside on a client computer such as a mobile or portable device and thus while certain hardware platforms are described herein aspects of the invention are equally applicable to nodes on a network. In an alternative embodiment the mobile device or portable device may represent the server portion while the server may represent the client portion.

The handset based services may include executable software software configurations hardware configurations and controls and handset operating system interfaces. As disclosed herein executable software may include without limitation any software program stored on the mobile device or associated memory device both permanently and temporarily connected via hardware or wireless connectivity. The mobile device may include an authentication system e.g. via a SIM a hardware interface a report system a script interface a script platform data and scripts . The network based services may include a network or networks mobile network services a mobile network operator customer service system a host information management system updated scripts and report data . The components of the mobile device and the network based services will be described below.

The components within the mobile device allow the device to integrate both handset based services and network based services . The authentication system can implement SIM Subscriber Identity Module card based or standalone authentication to meet network requirements for desired levels of security. Authenticating a system to meet network requirements may not be required but is often recommended.

The hardware interface may retrieve hardware interface elements required for interfacing with network or phone based customer support services. Examples of hardware interface elements include changing volume changing frequency retrieving SIM Subscriber Identity Module ID connection status from the SIM or radio hardware and others. The report system may collect and forward the data reported by the mobile device to the network . The report system can also encrypt the handset identification information to provide increased security. The information can be encoded so that only the host information management system can decipher the handset identification information.

The script interface serves as a standard application programming interface for customer support services. More specifically the script interface provides an interface between scripts and the various hardware specific and executable program specific functions. The script interface allows a single customer service script to be deployed across multiple operating systems and hardware configurations. In addition the script interface includes a standard API Application Programming Interface for both the hardware OS side and the script interface.

The script platform can mix and match calls through the script interface to acquire information to change or correct settings on the phone and to perform additional functions as described below. The script platform authenticates runs and updates all scripts manages reporting updates and changes communicates with the host information management system communicates with the GUI Graphical User Interface and manages customer surveys and interviews. The host information management system can push a notification to the script platform via USSD Unstructured Supplementary Services Data SMS Short Message Service IP Internet Protocol or any other network connectivity that the mobile device supports. The script platform can run the scripts after authentication and the scripts can be authenticated to the network or to the phone.

The components within the network based services allow the mobile device to communicate with and to retrieve data from the network . The network based services may include wired and wireless systems. The mobile network services may consist of one or more systems including billing CRM Customer Relationship Management provisioning and others. Furthermore mobile network services are able to return data calls made by mobile devices via standard network protocols e.g. IP DTMF Dual Tone Multi Frequency SMS USSD etc. .

The mobile network operator customer service system may also consist of one or more systems relating to customer service including billing CRM provisioning and others. The host information management system controls interactions between the mobile device and the host customer support system. The host information management system can transmit updates to the mobile device. The mobile device typically employs a unique handset ID or serial number and a mobile phone number. The report data provides storage for report information gathered from the mobile device. The updated scripts consist of scripts that the host customer support system provides to the mobile device. The updated scripts can be managed and versioned as desired by the host information management system can be targeted at specific subscribers or groups of subscribers and can include requests for reports and customer interview surveys.

The provisioning agent interacts with the updated scripts and report data . The provisioning agent collects report data associated with the device data and subscriber experience data from the mobile device . The provisioning agent also corrects subscriber problems in real time by transmitting appropriate scripts to the mobile device . The transmission of scripts to and the collection of data from the mobile device may be hosted within the network or externally. In addition the updated scripts and the report data may be stored in an SQL Structured Query Language database .

The mobile device may include a rendering platform e.g. implemented in C an optional UI User Interface server a client and a script interface . The client generates reports containing subscriber data and transmits the reports to the network based services . The client receives scripts from the network based services that can correct subscriber problems. The script interface allows a single script to be executed by multiple operating systems and hardware configurations. In addition the mobile device may also include an OS Operating System specific OEM Original Equipment Manufacturer and device hardware . In general the mobile device scripts or applications may be customized via a European Computer Manufacture s Association ECMA compliant scripting language such as JavaScript. Such software can be installed by the manufacturer or after manufacturing such as over the air particularly with open OS based devices. For proprietary OS based devices a small kernel can be installed at the time of manufacturing or flashed onto the device at a later time and then the full client application can be installed on the mobile device over the air.

As explained herein the scripts or software applications on the mobile device provide for at least the following processes providing customer care to a subscriber on the mobile device by intercepting calls diagnostic tools to allow customer service representatives to remotely execute diagnostics and commands on the mobile device or to facilitate diagnostics with other equipment with proactive tool to correct problems for subscribers on the mobile device collecting and summarizing data and other metrics with respect to mobile devices and guides to train subscribers when they need it most such as the first time they attempt to use an application.

The screens may be stored as display descriptions graphical user interfaces or other methods of depicting information on a computer screen e.g. commands links fonts colors layout sizes and relative positions and the like where the layout and information or content to be displayed on the page is stored in a database. In general a link refers to any resource locator identifying a resource on a network such as a display description provided by an organization having a site or node on the network. A display description as generally used herein refers to any method of automatically displaying information on a computer screen in any of the above noted formats as well as other formats such as email or character code based formats algorithm based formats e.g. vector generated Flash format or matrix or bit mapped formats.

A subscriber may access the display on a screen by dialing a support number such as their mobile carrier s support number. The display automatically provides the subscriber with a list of top issues or questions which may answer common customer support questions. Subscribers can scroll down on the display using a more options button to view additional issues. Subscribers can select an issue from the list using a select button . Selecting an issue allows the mobile device to retrieve relevant data from the local programmable non volatile memory .

If the mobile device determines that the subscriber s call should be intercepted at block then the call along with access information required to route a message to the mobile device is directed to the mobile device application running on the subscriber s mobile device block . In one embodiment the mobile device could play sounds or show a dialog on the display to indicate that a call has been intercepted. The mobile device application routes a signaling message indicating that the subscriber s call has been intercepted to the customer support call center via network signaling technologies such as SMS or USSD and may receive a response message back. In block the mobile device receives and processes any signaling message from the mobile device application. The mobile device may also receive certain customer self support data from the network. In block a customer support session begins on the subscriber s mobile device using locally stored data received from the mobile device application. The mobile device may use a variety of technologies to display and respond to the customer support issue in question. In block the mobile device addresses the subscriber s support issue locally as described below. In an alternative embodiment the mobile device retrieves data or scripts from the network to address the subscriber s support issue as noted above block .

In an alternative embodiment the call center determines if the subscriber s call should be intercepted and directs the call accordingly. The call center may utilize an IVRS Interactive Voice Recognition System to communicate with the subscriber. If the call center determines that the call should not be intercepted then the call is allowed to continue through the call center for processing block . If the call center determines that the call should be intercepted then the call is redirected back to the mobile device for local processing block . Thus if the call goes through to the call center IVRS and then is routed back to the mobile device the call to the call center may includes access information to facilitate routing a message back to the mobile device via SMSUSSD or other network signaling technologies. The call center employs a software application to direct mobile equipment so that it automatically processes requests it receives from mobile devices.

In some examples the system may be utilized to handle information or 411 calls. In these examples the mobile device may intercept a 411 call and provide options to the user such as a list of previously requested numbers with or without associated information associated with these numbers options to access information via commonly or recently accessed web pages and so forth.

In response to the subscriber s call the wireless service provider may provide back information to be displayed on the subscriber s phone such as that shown in upper portion in . The wireless service provider may also provide detailed information such as links to one or more web pages associated with the requested information or specific information that needs to be displayed on the mobile device based on the options provided such as providing to the mobile device a map of the requested information. In this example the subscriber selects to view the map via option and the now locally stored map may be shown on the mobile device as shown in . The mobile device launches any appropriate device application to display or access data. In the example of the mobile device launches a web browser to display the map. In some examples the system may be utilized to handle directory assistance calls. In these examples the mobile device may intercept a directory assistance call and provide options to the user such as a list of previously requested contacts with or without associated information associated with these contacts options to access information via commonly or recently accessed contacts and so forth.

In response to the customer s enquiry the call center may provide back information to be displayed on the customer s phone such as that shown in upper portion in . As also shown the screen may show further options once connected such as an option to call the found contact or to search for more information regarding the found contact using a search platform such as Google s My Result. 

A service provider may partner with a search engine service such as Google s My Result service or Orange s PocketThis service. shows an example of utilizing such a service after a customer selects Google with my result . Upon selection the system presents screen that may contain an information portion that indicates the status of the call or further options available to the customer such as paths to other available information of interest. The wireless service provider may send an SMS to the phone after the call offering extended services such as those as shown.

In some embodiments providing localized customer support involves the use of tutorials or guides to instruct subscribers in using applications or functions on their mobile devices. When a subscriber launches an application on their mobile device for the first time the mobile device may be able to detect this first time usage. The mobile device may then locally launch an automated training tutorial that addresses the context of the application or situation. The tutorials serve to guide the subscriber along and include a set of instructions. In addition the mobile device may automatically collect configuration or setup data from the subscriber to deliver automated context sensitive tutorials and guides at relevant times. Alternatively or additionally the mobile device may retrieve training tutorials or guides from the network or the use of automated context sensitive training tutorials in one application or service may key automated training in another application or service. Results of the training tutorials may be logged for offline analysis. Further rather than just providing the tutorial functionality the first time the mobile device can monitor usage of device functions and initiate the tutorial functionality after a predetermined period of time has elapsed e.g. three months . After the predetermined time the mobile device may assume that the subscriber has forgotten how to perform the desired function and therefore again provides the tutorial functionality. Alternatively or additionally the mobile device may provide a tutorial after a preset number of times. For example if a subscriber has taken three pictures and has not emailed or otherwise sent any photo messages then the mobile device launches a tutorial regarding how to send photos via the mobile device or provides an indication to the subscriber asking whether he or she would like to view the tutorial .

Upon receiving the yes selection the tutorial may present options to begin such as by asking the user if he she would like interactive help or would like to review frequently asked questions . Additionally the tutorial may display marketing information such as information related to the service provider s services or other sponsored services.

In some cases the tutorial may help the user to configure the device and or user s account. For example displays an example of a user or device configuration of picture messaging. In some cases the tutorial provides information such as step by step instructions on how to use the capabilities of services provided by the device and or service provider. For example displays an example of help balloons that provide instructions to assist a user in sending a picture via the picture messaging service. In this embodiment locally stored scripts provide contextual training marketing or both.

The tutorial software creates a single process flow that can interact with a variety of manufacturer s picture messaging products. shows an example process flow as a routine for displaying a tutorial screen over a user selected application based upon a recognized event. In some cases the application runs in the background on the mobile phone waiting for specific system events. For example in step the system detects a need to provide contextual information for another application via the detection of predetermined system events such as a photo being taken combined with an image being saved an initial text message received combined with a reply indication and so on . In step the system makes a copy of a screen buffer the current image on the screen . In step the system moves the application to the top of an application stack in the phone. In step the system displays the copied image as the tutorial s main screen. This gives the appearance that the previous application e.g. the picture messaging application is still on top of the application stack. The system may also compare portions of the screen to verify that it is in an expected state. An image hashing comparison discussed in greater detail with respect to may be used for the comparison. For example portions of the screen indicating activity of the camera application could be verified to be present. In the comparison hash values may be stored to facilitate the comparison. These values are small is storage size and therefore the system may perform the comparison without expending a lot of the mobile device s resources.

In step the system places the information that it wants to display e.g. text bubble on top of the copy of the previous application and processes user input and other events e.g. received input from a user via a manual keypad as needed. Looping back to step the system may update the display as needed to maintain the illusion of the previous application still being active and provide the desired information. When finished the system moves the application off the top of the application stack effectively handing control back to the previous application. All or part of routine may be repeated as needed to present step by step instructions or additional tutorial screens.

Although the above example relates to using guide or tutorial applications with picture messaging applications the system may use the guide or tutorial applications described above with other mobile device applications or functions or services . Table 1 presents a number of examples of these mobile device applications although others may be used with the system 

The guide or tutorial applications described herein detect user inputs but may also launch based on historical or other evaluations. In some cases the guide asks users context based questions to facilitate the user of a certain or selection function or service of the mobile device.

The customer self support and other features described herein are not limited to mobile devices as noted above. Such features can apply to any remote device including consumer appliances such as refrigerators dishwashers washers dryers ovens and so forth. With any of such appliances having computing capabilities and or connection to the internet such devices can locally store information and provide the functionality described above to handle customer inquiries that previously had been handled by a call center or web site accessed by the consumer via another device such as the consumers computer.

Thus in an alternate embodiment a mobile device may use a Bluetooth or other wireless protocol link to communicate with the household appliances. For example a Bluetooth link between a refrigerator and a mobile device may allow the mobile device to automatically detect a drop in the temperature of the refrigerator. Upon automatic detection the mobile device may alert the user regarding the drop in temperature. Using the mobile device as an interface the user may find information to address the drop in temperature on the mobile device itself may download information from a network or may call a customer support center for the specific appliance.

As noted above each remote device may include the customer self support functionality described herein. Further since some remote devices may lack a sufficient display screen or other user interface the remote device may communicate with the mobile device so that the mobile device operates as a more robust user interface for that remote device. Thus consumers may receive instruction screens or tutorials from an appliance and provide commands to that appliance through the mobile device.

Alternatively or additionally the mobile device may locally perform diagnostic scripts on the device to gather user device and network data. Such scripts may be loaded over the air OTA and may be so loaded at any point or initiated from a call center agent desktop computer. By either agent or mobile device initiation diagnostic scripts on the phone are automatically initiated proactively to resolve problems encountered by the subscriber. In some embodiments the mobile device or the call center agent can collect via scripts all the required information over the air without asking the subscriber.

For example shows a block diagram of components within a mobile phone network to perform connection diagnostics on fixed wireless equipment such as customer owned WIFI access points connected to a IP network. Mobile device which contains scripted procedures may access customer premises equipment at a number of points including connections to a wireless access point or to some or all of the devices and or themselves. Using the mobile network associated with the device the customer premises equipment can then access service provider equipment to query the system and continue the diagnosis.

In some cases diagnostics are remotely initiated by a customer care agent or an automated diagnostic system. In these cases the diagnostics are initiated when a network management system loses connectivity when a subscriber contacts a customer service agent and indicates that the system is not working when the mobile device attempts to make a connection for voice over IP VOIP calling and the connection does no work and so on. Additionally the system may perform the scripted procedures with or without subscriber interaction.

In some cases the scripts on the mobile device may be modified and updated based on information acquired post customer premises equipment CPE linking. Scripts may be server based or locally cached or combinations of locally cached and server based. Scripts may be used to configure routers access points Bluetooth WIFI etc and so on. Additionally the chain of equipment may be analyzed and problems may be diagnosed from both ends of the wired and or wireless network.

In some cases the system provides scripted procedures to determine the wireless detection of and wireless link activation to wireless access points for convergent fixed line and mobile telecommunications handsets. In these cases the mobile phone recognizes an access point locally by trying to make a connection from the mobile phone back to an ACS or network connection. The mobile phone performs local analysis of access points to determine whether the phone can for example connect to the PSTN. The phone sniffs for useable networks and alerts the user when a useable network is identified. The phone can then query the user as to whether to connect to the newly identified network so as to route calls through the PSTN via this new access point. The phone can thus perform a diagnostic on the connection to see if that connection to the network at this newly discovered access point is sufficient to provide the service that the user requests. The phone may include business rules identifying the services that the user wishes from access points.

In some cases the methods described above enable the mobile device to build LAN connections to customer equipment when a WAN between the equipment and a network is not working. The LAN connections enable diagnostics to be performed by an operator or other entities related to the equipment suppliers etc. . The system manages the diagnostic connections via the scripts described above.

In some embodiments the system provides for an accurate interaction between a user of a mobile device and customer service support. show a method for efficient digital comparison of visually displayed information. In these examples the system provides a hash or unique number on a portion of a screen displayed on the user s mobile phone with a similar hash to see if the mobile device is on the same page as an expected page or on the same page as a customer service person following along with a user of the device in order to provide support to the user.

In some embodiments the system uses the above comparison to verify that an application running on the mobile device is in an expected state. Hash values for an expected screen state may be precalculated and saved to the device. For example If a running guide application determines that the state of the device is not as expected such as the user takes an incoming call while in the middle of the guide application then the guide application may close that is the guide application gets out of the users way. .

In some embodiments the comparison may be between a guide application running on a customer s mobile device and a similar application running on a customer support agent s machine. Because the hash values are small the comparison may be determined or verified with a minimum of network traffic. Looking at the system may select a target pixel region in a visual display field of a rasterized image for comparison such as a display field on a customer s device . The system may then save off the coordinates of the selected area REGION . The system may then hash the selected raster pixels such as an RGB red blue green value per pixel of the selected area using a one way hashing function such as MD5 to determine a first hash value. The system then saves the resulting hash value Hash1 . Only a small hash value needs to be transmitted to or cached on the mobile device for evaluation and not for example the entire display field. The MD5 hash algorithm for example gives an output of only 128 bits 16 bytes . Although the MD5 hash algorithm is used in this example other suitable hash algorithms are possible.

Optionally or additionally other data storage formats for representing an image region may be used in the comparison described above although the format compares hash values should be similarly formatted For example if a baseline image format being hashed is RGB band interleaved by pixel BIP and 8 bits per sample then the comparison image should not be in band sequential format BSQ or band interleaved by line format BIL any non RGB colorspace or any bits per sample other than 8 for all bands .

At the customer support side the system performs similar steps in order to compare the two. The system may select a target pixel region in the visual display field of a rasterized image based on coordinates determined in the preparation step REGION . The system may then hash the selected raster pixels such as an RGB value per pixel of the selected area using a one way hashing function such as MD5 to determine a second hash value hash2 .

The system may then compare the current hash value hash2 to a previously saved hash value hash1 to determine if the visual display is the same as previously determined such as determining if REGION Hash1 Hash2 REGION is true or false. This comparison could also iterate through a list of HashN value to find a match. The system may then use the true false result to make decisions.

For example the system may perform a remote comparison of expected and actual behavior on remote mobile devices such as sending a hash1 value from a networked computer to a mobile phone. The mobile handset processor evaluates the image in REGION and creates a hash value hash2 and responds back to the networked computer with the results of the comparison or derivative of the comparison . Additionally a list of HashN values could be sent to the device and the index to the matching value could be returned.

As described above the system may perform a local comparison of expected and actual behavior on mobile devices using the above detailed comparison. The pre cached value for REGION and hash1 may be stored locally on the mobile device and the result may be used locally.

The system may perform such comparisons of hash values to make decisions related to use of the system or effectiveness of the system. In some cases a customer service agent may want to determine if the mobile device user followed the proper steps in a complex process. The agent may to determine if the user is in the correct state by performing the visual comparison. Also when a complex series of tests are performed on a mobile device and the tests involve multiple device applications the comparison value can be used to determine that the device is in the expected state. The testing may be further enhanced by including unique visual elements in the visual display such as a unique number that can be used in the comparison.

Unless the context clearly requires otherwise throughout the description and the claims the words comprise comprising and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense that is to say in the sense of including but not limited to. As used herein the terms connected coupled or any variant thereof means any connection or coupling either direct or indirect between two or more elements the coupling of connection between the elements can be physical logical or a combination thereof. Additionally the words herein above below and words of similar import when used in this application shall refer to this application as a whole and not to any particular portions of this application. Where the context permits words in the above Detailed Description using the singular or plural number may also include the plural or singular number respectively. The word or in reference to a list of two or more items covers all of the following interpretations of the word any of the items in the list all of the items in the list and any combination of the items in the list.

The above detailed description of embodiments of the invention is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed above. While specific embodiments of and examples for the invention are described above for illustrative purposes various equivalent modifications are possible within the scope of the invention as those skilled in the relevant art will recognize. For example while processes or blocks are presented in a given order alternative embodiments may perform routines having steps or employ systems having blocks in a different order and some processes or blocks may be deleted moved added subdivided combined and or modified. Each of these processes or blocks may be implemented in a variety of different ways. Also while processes or blocks are at times shown as being performed in series these processes or blocks may instead be performed in parallel or may be performed at different times.

Further the mobile device may employ many other locally stored applications beyond those described above. For example the mobile device may include its own IVR system rather than employing an IVR system at the call center. Thus the subscriber navigates through a series of IVR menus to access desired information some of which may be stored on the phone. However one option in the local IVR could be to have the device place a call to the customer support call center.

In another alternative embodiment the system may provide links to web pages supplied by the wireless service provider where these links are to specific web pages directly addressing a need or question relevant to a current status of a user s mobile device. Such an alternative is useful when a mobile device has a web browser and sufficient data connection to the service provider s web server. Thus a call intercept function on the mobile device may provide a link to a relevant web page or even access that page automatically so that it is displayed to the user rather than for example displaying locally stored content .

While many embodiments described above employ software stored on the mobile device either before being given to a subscriber or during a subscriber call the scripts and other software noted above may be hard coded into the mobile device e.g. stored in EEPROM PROM etc. .
