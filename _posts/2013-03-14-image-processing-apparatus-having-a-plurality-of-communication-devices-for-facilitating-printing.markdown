When the MFP the CPU does not receive the target data transmission request from the mobile phone S No it is a case where the specific information is not displayed on the panel at the time when the MFP detects that the NFC reader is in close proximity to within the predetermined distance from the NFC tag S Yes . Namely it is a case where the data to be transmitted to the mobile phone is not determined. Therefore by transmitting the data list to the mobile phone S the MFP is allowed to cause the mobile phone to perform the process to select the data to be transmitted to the mobile phone S . Then in response to receipt of the selected data transmission request containing the selected data identification information from the mobile phone S Yes the MFP is allowed to transmit the selected data identified by the selected data identification information to the mobile phone via the wireless LAN communications and S . Thereby when the mobile phone is held over brought into close proximity to the MFP during the period that the specific information is not displayed on the panel it is possible to select the data to be communicated on the mobile phone .

The communication speed of the wireless LAN communications and is faster than that of the NFC communication . Further the image data is communicated via the wireless LAN communications and S .

For example the method for informing the user of the specific information may be a method to inform the user using the indicating lamp of the specific information that the image processing is in execution S No .

In the aforementioned embodiment the receipt of the target data transmission request see S the receipt of the data list transmission request see S and the transmission of the data list see S are carried out via the wireless LAN communication . However the receipt of the target data transmission request see S the receipt of the data list transmission request see S and the transmission of the data list see S may be implemented via the NFC communication .

In the aforementioned embodiment the explanation has been provided as to the case where in S the MFP the CPU stores the selected function information corresponding to the selected function of the MFP in the tag storage section of the NFC tag . However the step S may be omitted. In this case since the selected function information is not transmitted to the mobile phone the mobile phone is not allowed to recognize the function currently selected on the MFP . Therefore in S the mobile phone the CPU may display on the panel thereof a screen for selecting a function of the MFP and accept entry to select a function of the MFP . Further the mobile phone may be configured to in response to the acceptance of the entry to select a function of the MFP issue to the MFP a request for the data list corresponding to the selected function.

In S when the information transmitted from the NFC tag does not contain the selected function information S No the mobile phone the CPU may establish the wireless connection with the access point S and establish the communication with the MFP S . Then in S the mobile phone may issue a request for data lists regarding all the functions of the MFP . Further in S the mobile phone may display on the panel thereof a screen for selecting a function of the MFP and accept entry to select a function of the MFP . Moreover the mobile phone may display on the panel the data list corresponding to the selected function.

In the aforementioned embodiment the communication for achieving the facsimile transmission function and the incoming facsimile browsing function is performed via the telephone line network . However the communication for achieving the facsimile transmission function and the incoming facsimile browsing function may be performed via an Internet not shown .

The mobile phone and the MFP may be configured to perform wireless LAN communication in an ad hoc mode without having to involving the access point .

In the aforementioned embodiment the data of which the specific information is displayed on the panel is defined as the target data. However the specific information displayed on the panel may include specific information that is not currently displayed on the panel but is displayable on the panel through a scrolling operation.

In S the determination that the image processing has been completed may not necessarily be made in response to an event that image processing such as a scanning process or a facsimile transmitting receiving process has been completed but may be made in response to acceptance of a user s input e.g. pressing of an OK button for informing that the user has confirmed that the image processing has been completed after the completion of the image processing. In this case the state where the specific information is displayed on the panel may be maintained until acceptance of the user s input for informing that the user has confirmed that the image processing has been completed. Alternatively the determination that the image processing has been completed may be made after a lapse of a predetermined period of time e.g. five minutes since the completion of the image processing. In this case the state where the specific information is displayed on the panel may be maintained until the predetermined period of time elapses since the completion of the image processing.

Further instead of the mobile phone a device having a communication function e.g. a notebook computer may be employed. In this case the MFP control application may be included in various kinds of driver software installed in the notebook computer.

There may be one or more MFPs each having an NFC tag in addition to the MFP exemplified in the aforementioned embodiment.
