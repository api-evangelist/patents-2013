Disclosed embodiments relate to adjusting the price and or size of a user s quota of storage space in a content management system based on characteristics that describe how the user uses the storage space.

An online content management system permits users to store content in association with their accounts on the online content management system. Conventionally users of the online content management system are offered a set amount of storage space for an established price regardless of how the user chooses to use the storage space. In some cases a larger amount of space can be purchased by any user for an established higher price. In one example a first allotment of space is provided to each user for free with additional space available for purchase by any user at a set price.

An online content management system dynamically determines a new account configuration to offer to a user including the price and or size of a user s quota of storage space in an account on the online content management system based on usage characteristics of the account. An account management module tracks account usage. The account management module analyzes the account usage and applies a model to predict the willingness of the user to pay for a new account configuration. Responsive to the results of the prediction the new account configuration is offered to the user. The new account configuration includes a combination of a quota size and price and may include other account features or information. The user s feedback on the offered new account configuration is tracked. If the user accepts the offer the user s account details are updated accordingly. If the user rejects the offer this feedback may be added as input into future predictions of that user s willingness to pay for a new account configuration.

In the environment of each client device accesses content through online content management system . Thus each client device may jointly access various types of content such as a folder MyFolder containing files such as file file and photo. Various types of devices can function as a client device such desktop computer A tablet computer B and mobile device C. Any device capable of accessing online content management system and interacting with the content items stored on content management system may be used as client device .

Users may create accounts at content management system and store content in online content management system by transmitting the content from client device to online content management system . Users may also store content on online content management system by for example requesting transfer of content items from other content providers to online content management system . The content stored by users in online content management system is associated with user accounts that may have various privileges. The privileges may include viewing the content item modifying the content item modifying user privileges related to the content item deleting the content item and sharing the content item with other users. The content can also include folders of various types with different behaviors or other content item grouping methods. For example an account can include a public folder that is accessible to any user. The public folder can be assigned a web accessible address. A link to the web accessible address can be used to access the contents of the public folder. In another example an account can include a photos folder that is intended for photos and that provides specific attributes and actions tailored for photos an audio folder that provides the ability to play back audio files and perform other audio related actions or other special purpose folders. In another example an account can include a downloads folder that is the default folder in which content items from third party content servers are stored. An account can also include shared folders or group folders that are linked with and available to multiple user accounts. The permissions for multiple users may be different for a shared folder.

Client devices communicate with online content management system through network . The network may be any suitable communications network for data transmission. In one embodiment network is the Internet and uses standard communications technologies and or protocols. Thus network can include links using technologies such as Ethernet 802.11 worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX 3G digital subscriber line DSL asynchronous transfer mode ATM InfiniBand PCI Express Advanced Switching etc. Similarly the networking protocols used on network can include multiprotocol label switching MPLS the transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP the User Datagram Protocol UDP the hypertext transport protocol HTTP the simple mail transfer protocol SMTP the file transfer protocol FTP etc. The data exchanged over network can be represented using technologies and or formats including the hypertext markup language HTML the extensible markup language XML etc. In addition all or some of links can be encrypted using conventional encryption technologies such as the secure sockets layer SSL transport layer security TLS virtual private networks VPNs Internet Protocol security IPsec etc. In another embodiment online content management system and client devices use custom and or dedicated data communications technologies instead of or in addition to the ones described above.

Client devices maintain various components and modules for operating the client device and accessing online content management system . The software modules include operating system and one or more content applications . Content applications vary based on the client device and may include various applications for creating viewing consuming and or modifying content stored on online content management system such as word processors spreadsheets database management systems code editors image and video editors e book readers audio and video players and the like. Operating system on each device provides a local file management system and executes the various software modules such as content management system client application and content applications .

Client device access online content management system in a variety of ways. Client device may access online content management system through a native application or software module such as content management system client application . A schematic example display from content management system client application is shown in on client devices B and C. Client device may also access online content management system through web browser as shown in on client device A. As an alternative the client application may integrate access to online content management system with the local file management system provided by operating system . When access to online content management system is integrated in the local file management system a file organization scheme maintained at online content management system is represented as a local file structure by operating system in conjunction with client application .

Client application manages access to online content management system . Client application may take various forms such as a stand alone application an application plug in or a browser extension. Client application includes user interface module local content and content access module .

User interface module of client application generates an interface to the content accessed by client application as variously illustrated herein and is one means for performing this function. The generated interface is provided to the user by display .

Local content may store content accessed from online content management system by client application . While represented here as within client application local content may be stored with other data for client device in non volatile storage. When local content is stored this way the content is available to the user and other applications or modules such as content applications even when client application is not in communication with online content management system .

Content access module of client application manages updates to local content and communicates with online content management system to synchronize content modified by client device with content maintained on online content management system and is one means for performing this function.

In certain embodiments client device includes additional components such as camera and location module . Camera may be used to capture images or video for upload to the online content management system . Location module determines the location of client device using for example a global positioning satellite signal cellular tower triangulation or other methods. Location module may be used by client application to obtain location data and add the location data to metadata about a content item such as an image captured by camera .

Communications interface enables online content management system to interface with various client devices and with other content and or service providers via an Application Programming Interface API which is one means for performing this function. Certain software applications access content stored by the online content management system via an API on behalf of a user. For example a software package such as an app on a smartphone or tablet computing device can programmatically make calls directly to online content management system when a user provides credentials to read write create delete share or otherwise manipulate content. Similarly the API can allow users to access all or part of content stored by online content management system through a web site.

User interface module generates a web interface that allows a user to view or manipulate content and is one means for performing this function. For example the user can navigate in web browser to a web address provided by online content management system . Changes or updates to content stored by online content management system made through the web interface such as uploading a new version of a file are synchronized back to other client devices associated with the user s account. Multiple client devices may be associated with a single account and files in the account are synchronized between each of the multiple client devices .

Account management module can be configured to update and or obtain user account details stored in user account database and is one means for performing this function. Account management module can be configured to interact with any number of other modules in online content management system . The operation of account management module in determining a new account configuration to offer to a user based on the user s usage of the user s account will be described in detail below with reference to .

User account database maintains details of the user accounts and is one means for performing the function of maintaining user account details. An account can be used to store content such as documents text files audio files video files etc. from one or more client devices associated with the account. User account database can store profile information for registered users. In some cases the only personal information in the user profile can be a username and or email address. However online content management system can also be configured to accept additional user information such as password recovery information demographics information payment information and other details. Each user is associated with an identifier such as a userID or a user name. User account database can also include account management information such as account type e.g. free or paid usage information for each user e.g. file edit history and file access history from each client device used by the user maximum storage space authorized storage space used content storage locations security settings personal configuration settings content sharing data etc.

Authenticator module verifies user credentials security tokens API calls specific client devices etc. to determine whether access to requested content items is authorized and is one means for performing the function of determining whether access to content items is authorized. Authenticator module can generate one time use authentication tokens for a user account. Authenticator module assigns an expiration period or date to each authentication token. In addition to sending the authentication tokens to requesting client devices authenticator module can store generated authentication tokens in authentication token database . Upon receiving a request to validate an authentication token authenticator module checks authentication token database for a matching authentication token assigned to the user. Once the authenticator module identifies a matching authentication token authenticator module determines if the matching authentication token is still valid. For example authenticator module verifies that the authentication token has not expired or was not marked as used or invalid. After validating an authentication token authenticator module may invalidate delete or mark as used the matching authentication token in the authentication token database to prevent future re use of a single use token.

Content item management module maintains a content directory that identifies the location of each content item in content storage and allows client applications to request access to content items in content storage and is one means for performing these functions. A content entry in the content directory can also include a content pointer that identifies the location of the content item in content storage . For example the content entry can include a content pointer designating the storage address of the content item in memory. In some embodiments the content entry includes multiple content pointers that point to multiple locations each of which contains a portion of the content item.

Content storage stores content items and is one means for performing the function of storing content items. Content storage can be a storage device multiple storage devices or a server. Alternatively content storage can be a cloud storage provider or network storage accessible via one or more communications networks. In one configuration online content management system stores the content items in the same organizational structure as they appear on client device . However online content management system can store the content items in its own order arrangement or hierarchy. Content storage can also store metadata describing content items content item types and the relationship of content items to various accounts folders or groups. The metadata for a content item can be stored as part of the content item or can be stored separately. In one configuration each content item stored in content storage can be assigned a system wide unique identifier. Content storage can decrease the amount of storage space required by identifying duplicate files or duplicate segments of files. In one embodiment for example a content item may be shared among different users by including identifiers of the users within ownership metadata of the content item e.g. an ownership list while storing only a single copy of the content item and using pointers or other mechanisms to link duplicates with the single copy. Similarly content storage stores files using a file version control mechanism that tracks changes to files different versions of files such as a diverging version tree and a change history. The change history includes a set of changes that when applied to the original file version produces the changed file version.

Sharing module manages sharing content publicly or privately and is one means for performing the function of managing sharing. Sharing content publicly can include making the content item accessible from any computing device in network communication with online content management system . Sharing content privately can include linking a content item in content storage with two or more user accounts so that each user account has access to the content item. The content can also be shared across varying types of user accounts. In addition to a content path and content pointer a content entry in some configurations also includes a user account identifier that identifies the user account that has access to the content item. In some embodiments multiple user account identifiers can be associated with a single content entry indicating that the content item has shared access by the multiple user accounts. To share a content item privately sharing module adds a user account identifier to the content entry associated with the content item thus granting the added user account access to the content item. Sharing module can also be configured to remove user account identifiers from a content entry to restrict a user account s access to the content item. To share content publicly sharing module generates a custom network address such as a URL which allows any web browser to access the content in online content management system without any authentication. The sharing module includes content identification data in the generated URL which can later be used by online content management system to properly identify and return the requested content item. For example sharing module can be configured to include the user account identifier and the content path in the generated URL. The content identification data included in the URL can be transmitted to online content management system by client device to access the content item. In addition to generating the URL sharing module can also be configured to record that a URL to the content item has been created. In some embodiments the content entry associated with a content item can include a URL flag indicating whether a URL to the content item has been created.

Synchronization module automatically synchronizes content from one or more client devices and is one means for performing the function of synchronizing content. The synchronization is platform agnostic. That is the content is synchronized across multiple client devices of varying type capabilities operating systems etc. For example client application synchronizes via synchronization module at online content management system content in client device s file system with the content in an associated user account on system . Client application synchronizes any changes to specified content e.g. content located in a designated folder or its sub folders with the synchronization module . Such changes include new deleted modified copied or moved files or folders. Synchronization module also provides any changes to content associated with client device to client application . This synchronizes the local content at client device with the content items at online content management system .

Conflict management module determines whether there are any discrepancies between versions of a content item located at different client devices and is one means for performing this function. For example when a content item is modified at one client device and a second client device differing versions of the content item may exist at each client device. Synchronization module determines such versioning conflicts for example by identifying the modification time of the content item modifications. Conflict management module resolves the conflict between versions by any suitable means such as by merging the versions or by notifying client device of the later submitted version.

Content saving module makes content items of third party providers available to a user via the user s account on online content management system and is one means for performing this function. In one embodiment content saving module receives a request that specifies the user of online content management system for whom the content item should be saved the content item to be saved and the content provider that provides the content. Content saving module determines whether the content item has already been stored within content storage and if not obtains the content item from the third party content provider if it has not already been obtained and stores it within content storage .

Content subscription module handles user subscriptions to content that is made available on an ongoing basis and is one means for performing the function of handling user subscriptions to content. A subscription represents a plurality of content items provided by a particular content provider over a period of time to a user. In some embodiments content subscription module handles both the initial establishment of a subscription by a user and also the subsequent obtaining of the content items made available as part of the subscription. When establishing an initial subscription content subscription module receives as input a unique identifier of the user e.g. a username to be subscribed and subscription information describing the details of the subscription. Subscription module stores subscription information within subscription database .

Subscription database stores subscription information in association with a user identifier and is one means for performing this function. The subscription information can then be used to obtain new content items that are provided as part of the subscription. In one embodiment the subscription information includes a URL at which the content item is to be obtained and optionally an indicator of a frequency at which to check for new content items. More generally the subscription information may include any form of description of the location and update frequency of content in the subscription or any type procedural instructions used to obtain new content items.

Online content management system may be implemented using a single computer or a network of computers including cloud based computer implementations. For the purposes of this disclosure a computer is device having one or more processors memory storage devices and networking resources. The computers are preferably server class computers including one or more high performance CPUs and 1G or more of main memory as well as 500 Gb to 2 Tb of computer readable persistent storage and running an operating system such as LINUX or variants thereof. The operations of online content management system as described herein can be controlled through either hardware or through computer programs installed in computer storage and executed by the processors of such server to perform the functions described herein. These systems include other hardware elements necessary for the operations described here including network interfaces and protocols input devices for data entry and output devices for display printing or other presentations of data but which are not described herein. Similarly conventional elements such as firewalls load balancers notes servers failover servers network management tools and so forth are not shown so as not to obscure the features of the system. Finally the functions and operations of online content management system are sufficiently complex as to require implementation on a computer system and cannot be performed in the human mind simply by mental steps.

Usage tracking module of account management module tracks each user s respective account usage. Example tracked usage data includes the amount of the user s current quota of storage space consumed the amount of the user s current quota of storage space remaining the frequency of access and the timing of access e.g. during the work week or in the evenings and on weekends the number and type of client devices linked to the user s account that the user uses to access the account the physical locations from which users access the account e.g. according to GPS and or WiFi data from client devices the number and types of content items stored by the user e.g. text files images photographs audio files spreadsheets proprietary file formats used by certain applications etc. the number of users with whom the user shares content items the identity of other users with whom the user shares content items the frequency of content synching the number of content subscriptions to which the user subscribes the presence of key words in the content items stored by the user and other measures of how the user makes use of the user s account on online content management system . All usage data collected observed or processed by the usage tracking module may be stored in the usage database .

Modeling module builds and refines at least one model of user behavior that predicts a user s willingness to pay for new account configurations based on observed usage characteristics. In one embodiment machine learning algorithms are used to train models based on the tracked usage data combined with data that indicate whether a user accepted an offered new account configuration. Alternatively or additionally machine learning clustering analysis can be used to determine how to classify an account based on the usage data. For example a first class of accounts may include accounts belonging to users who have consumed their entire quotas of storage space make daily access to their accounts and exhibit a lot of sharing. A second class may include accounts belonging to users who have consumed somewhat less than their entire quotas of storage space make only occasional uses of their accounts and exhibit no sharing. A third class of accounts may include accounts belonging to users who use their accounts primarily to store photos. A fourth class of accounts may include accounts belonging to users who use their accounts primarily to synchronize text documents between their desktop and their tablet during business hours. Analysis of usage of a user s account allows it to be classified for example according to the above classes and treated as a member of the class for purposes of offering an account configuration and pricing. Other techniques known in the art for modeling user behavior may be used to develop one or more models with the goal of using the models to identify significant observable features or patterns of features of an account that can inform account management module s decision with respect to what account configuration and pricing to offer.

Model storage stores the set of models built and refined by modeling module . Depending on the implementation the stored models may be for example a series of observable account characteristics a threshold set of values for account variables a formula that combines account usage characteristics according to respective weights or other ways of expressing the importance or relative importance of at least one usage characteristic of an account in predicting the user s willingness to pay for a new account configuration.

Scoring module applies one or more models from model storage to determine whether a user should be offered a new account configuration and the terms of that offer. Scoring module scores the account against the model by accessing the respective account usage data from usage database . The model may also include user profile characteristics as additional features in some embodiments. In those cases the scoring module may also access user account database for user profile information. The output of scoring module predicts the user s willingness to pay for a new account configuration based on the observed usage characteristics. In one embodiment scoring module applies a plurality of models to determine which of a plurality of new account configurations to offer to a user based on how closely the user s account usage matches various identified classes of account usage.

Account configuration and pricing module determines based on the output of scoring module whether a new account configuration should be offered to a user. In one embodiment different treatments may be applied to different classes of accounts. The treatment variables can include how much storage space to offer what price to charge when to offer an upgrade and when if the offer will expire and what additional information to offer. For example based on the output of scoring module a first user may be offered an upgrade to the user s account including a substantial additional amount of storage space for a small fee and a second user may be offered a free temporary upgrade to their account including an additional amount of storage space along with an invitation to learn more about the available sharing features of their account. Through this offer the second user may be enticed to deepen her engagement with online content management system and thus become a better candidate for a new account configuration that generates more revenue for online content management system at a future point in time.

In one embodiment account options storage stores bundles of account configuration and pricing information for convenience and may store the account options applied to each user account. However it is noted that any combination of treatment variables may be offered based on the output of scoring module . Thus account management module can flexibly respond to any observed pattern in account usage that may indicate that a user would be receptive to an upgrade or other new account configuration.

User notification module notifies the user of the user s eligibility for a new account configuration. For example the user notification module may generate an email to the user or display a notification upon the user s next access of online content management system .

User feedback module tracks the user s feedback on the offered account configuration for example the user s acceptance or refusal of the offer. The user s feedback may be added as additional input to scoring a model that includes acceptance rejection of an offer as a feature of the model to predict a user s willingness to pay for a new account configuration.

In step account usage is tracked. For example usage tracking module of account management module may track the frequency and timing of account access the amount of storage space used and any other measures of usage.

In step the account usage is analyzed in order to predict willingness of the user to pay for a new account configuration. For example one or more models may be applied to the tracked account usage to classify or score the account based on the usage. The classification or score may indicate which account configuration to offer. In one embodiment scoring module of account management module scores the account usage based on a model built by modeling module and stored in model storage . The score predicts the user s willingness to pay for a new account configuration.

Responsive to the outcome of step indicating a willingness to pay for a new account configuration in step the new account configuration is offered to the user. The new account configuration includes a combination of a quota size and price and may include other account features or information.

In step the user s feedback on the offered new account configuration is tracked. If the user accepts the offer the user s account details are updated accordingly. If the user rejects the offer this feedback may be added as input into scoring a model that includes acceptance rejection of an offer as a feature of the model to predict a user s willingness to pay for a new account configuration.

Steps may be iterated over time. This allows the user s history of account usage to grow the model to be applied to the updated usage data and account management module to respond to new patterns in usage by offering a new account configuration to better meet the user s needs at a price the user is willing to pay.
