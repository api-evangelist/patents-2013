This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 103 958 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 016 223 filed Nov. 1 2001 issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7 941 541 and claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 245 101 filed Nov. 1 2000 the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.

Present invention relates to device synchronization and digital output and in particular to providing pervasive output for information apparatuses.

An Information apparatus refers to both stationary computers and mobile computing devices pervasive devices . Examples of information apparatuses include without limitation desktop computers laptop computers palmtop hand held computers personal digital assistants PDAs Internet enabled cellular phones smart phones pagers Internet appliances e books digital pads Web pads and digital capturing devices e.g. digital cameras and video cameras . An output device may include a fax machine printer copier image or video display device projector and an audio output device. For simplicity and convenience hereafter the following description may refer to an output device as a printer and an output process as printing. However it should be understood that the term printer and printing is used as a specific example to simplify description or may be one exemplary embodiment. The reference to printing used here is intended to be applied or extended to the larger scope and definition of output devices and should not be construed as restricting the scope and practice of present invention.

Fueled by ever increasing bandwidth and processing power and ever increasing numbers of wireless mobile devices and available software applications for pervasive devices millions of users are or will be creating downloading and transmitting content and information using their pervasive computing devices. Unfortunately the small display screen of a pervasive device may not provide a good viewing experience. As a result there is a need to allow users to easily output content and information from their pervasive computing devices to any output device. People need to output directly and conveniently from their pervasive information apparatus without depending on synchronizing with a stationary computer e.g. desktop personal computer for printing as an example.

To illustrate an information worker at an airport receiving e mail in his hand held computer may want to walk up to a nearby printer or fax machine to have his e mail printed. In addition the mobile worker may also want to print a copy of his to do list appointment book business card and his flight schedule from his mobile device. As another example a traveler stopping at a convenience store gas station or kiosks may want to print out a copy of the map he just downloaded from the Internet using his Internet enable wireless phone information apparatus . In still another example an individual who just finished a stock trade or performed an e commerce transaction using his PDA information apparatus may want to print out a copy of his transaction confirmation invoice or receipt. In yet another example a user who takes a picture with a digital camera may want to easily print it out to a nearby printer.

Conventionally an output device e.g. a printer is connected to an information apparatus via a wired connection such as a cable line. A wireless connection is also possible by using for example radio communication or infrared communication. Regardless of whether the connection is wired or wireless a user must first install in the information apparatus a printer driver corresponding to a particular printer model and make. Using a device dependent or specific driver the information apparatus may process output content or a digital document into the printer input space. The printer input space corresponds to the type of input that a printer understands herein referred to as print data . For example the printer input space or print data may include a printer specific input format e.g. image graphics file data format encoding page description language markup language instructions protocols or data that can be understood or used by a particular printer make and model.

Print data may be proprietary or a published standard or a combination of the two. A printer input space or print data is therefore in general device dependent. Different printer models may specify their own input designed or adopted for optimal operation by the printer manufacturer according to a specification. Consequently different printers usually require use of specific printer drivers for accurate printing. A device driver printer driver in this example may control manage communicate and output print data to a printer. Sometimes instead of using a printer or device driver the device driving feature may be included as part of an application software. The application in this example may process the document and communicate directly with an output device without utilizing a device driver. Print data is an output data sent to a printer. However the term print data used here is intended to be applied or extended to the larger scope and definition of output data which applies to any output devices including display projection and audio devices and this should not be construed as restricting the scope and practice of present invention.

Installation of a printer driver or application may be accomplished by for example manual installation using a CD or floppy disk supplied by the printer manufacturer. Or alternatively a user may be able to download that particular driver or application from a network. For a home or office user this installation process may take anywhere from several minutes to several hours depending on the type of driver and user s sophistication level with computing devices and networks. Even with plug and play driver installation the user is still required to execute a multi step process for each printer. This installation and configuration process adds a degree of complexity and work to end users who may otherwise spend their time doing other productive or enjoyable work. Moreover many unsophisticated users may be discouraged from adding new peripherals e.g. printers scanners etc. to their home computers or networks to avoid the inconvenience of installation and configuration. Therefore there is a need to provide a way for a user to more conveniently or easily output digital content to an output device without the inconvenience of manually finding and installing new device drivers or printer drivers. Installation of printer drivers if needed should be more automatic and transparent to end users.

In addition conventional printing methods may pose significantly higher challenges and difficulties for mobile device users than for home and office computer users. The requirement for pre installation of a device dependent driver is in conflict with the concept of mobile pervasive computing and output. For example a mobile user may want to print e mail PowerPoint presentation documents web pages or other documents in an airplane or at an airport gas station convenience store kiosk hotel conference room office home etc. It is highly unlikely that the user would find at any of these locations a printer of the same make and model as is at the user s base station. Therefore the user may have to install and configure a printer driver each time at each of these locations before printing. Alternatively it is also not a viable option usually to pre install all of the possible hundreds or even thousands of printer drivers available to the user s information apparatus. A mobile information device usually has limited memory and storage capacity. As a consequence the user would currently be required to install and configure a printer driver each time at each such different location before printing. Moreover the user may not want to be bothered with looking for a driver or downloading it and installing it just to print out one page of email at the airport. This is certainly an undesirable and discouraging process to promote pervasive or mobile computing. Therefore a more convenient or automated printing solution is needed so that a user can simply walk up to a printer and easily print a digital document without having to install or pre install a particular printer driver.

Network printing may partially solve the above problem in a local area network LAN . Network printing was first motivated to allow people to share printing resources within a network. Printers are often connected to the network using a network adapter or network card. Print servers may be used to manage print jobs such as spooling . Different clients may send print jobs to the print server for queuing prioritizing and managing. The driver of each networked printer may be stored in the network for example in an application server and available for clients to download.

The above configuration is often used in a local area network LAN such as in an office building. An office worker with a mobile or static computing device connected to this network may be able to send a print job to any printer that is connected to the same network. He either has the necessary printer drivers pre installed in his device or he can download a driver from the LAN before printing to a particular printer. But once outside of the office building or meaning outside of his wired or wireless network coverage the office worker can no longer print to any printer he or she desires.

In one instance it has been argued that the idea of local network printing can be further extended to the Internet as the larger and public network. In an ideal situation every printer and every computing device information apparatus is connected to the same network for example the Internet. But in reality extending network printing to a big super network or the Internet is still unavailable.

Nevertheless one drawback of network printing may be higher cost. To connect the output devices and information apparatus to the same network additional hardware or software may need to be installed. And therefore the costs of output devices may be raised substantially. In addition to hardware and software costs there are also service charges to maintain the connectivity to a large network such as the Internet. Furthermore a large permanent network infrastructure would need to be built and made available to each location.

In addition to costs another drawback of network printing is reliability. Network printing requires perfect function in any part of the chain of network hardware software and services. If any component of the link is down or not fully functional for any reason printing service may be unavailable interrupted or result in inaccuracies.

Finally another drawback of network printing is the issue of security. A user does not feel secure if confidential documents or information must pass through the entire network before reaching the printer immediately in front of him or her. There may be the fear that the confidential document could be intercepted viewed copied or stored within any segment of the connected network. There can also be the fear that the document could actually be printed to a different printer instead of the intended one. This problem may be caused by for example errors in directory service software a software component that is not up to date or corrupted inconsistent or incompatible software and or hardware versions or any combination of human software network or hardware errors. There is also risk when downloading a software component e.g. printer driver from the network to an information apparatus. This software component maybe damaged corrupted or carrying a malicious attack or virus or otherwise modified by hackers. A damaged software component can disrupt or corrupt the user s information apparatus. Finally some internal corporate or local networks may reject unknown documents trying to reach their printers and other output devices protected within a firewall. It is therefore more desirable if the communication and exchange of information are done locally between users information apparatus and the selected output device all within the range of the users watchful and inspecting eyes.

Accordingly the present invention provides a convenient method of digital printing in which a user need not pre install a device dependent printer driver on an information apparatus in order to print.

This invention can provide an easy friendly and convenient process for printing. Unlike conventional printing a user need not manually install a printer driver from a CD floppy disk or download it somewhere from an existing static network. With the apparatus and process of present invention all the software components data or printer drivers can be loaded to the information apparatus through easy and automatic synchronization process between the information apparatus and a printer having an output controller of present invention. As a result a mobile user with an information apparatus equipped with an output manager of present invention can print pervasively virtually at any time anywhere to any printer.

Furthermore this invention can provide a convenient method allowing users to print to any printer with or without connection to a static permanent network for both the information apparatus and the output device. Through local communication and synchronization directly between the information apparatus and the output device hardware and software installation for static network connectivity may not be necessary. Therefore printing costs may be reduced.

In addition this invention can provide a more reliable printing method than conventional remote network printing methods or processes. By communicating locally between an information apparatus and an output device the printing process does not depend on the perfect function of each element of a network chain. This chain may include for example network connections network servers application servers service providers and application providers. Therefore the chance of a successful printing under present invention is greatly enhanced as processing and communication involves fewer elements.

This invention can further provide a more secure printing process than conventional network printing processes and methods. Uploading or downloading data or software components such as a printer driver from an output device immediately in front of user provides a more secure feeling than dealing with components from a remote location in the network. Components stored in a large network may be perceived to have more exposure to tampering e.g. contaminated with a virus . An erroneous module or component in the network caused by a human or software or hardware error may also disrupt the function of the information apparatus. Furthermore sending a confidential digital document or print data directly to the printer in front of user provides a more secure feeling than if the document is routed through a large network with a plurality of users and servers. There are greater possibilities of the document being intercepted viewed copied stored or finally printed on a wrong printer in conventional network printing.

In accordance with present invention an electronic system and method of pervasive output allow an information apparatus to output digital content conveniently to virtually any output device. The information apparatus may be equipped with a central processing unit input output control unit storage unit memory unit and wired or wireless communication unit or adapters. The information apparatus preferably also includes output manager that may be implemented as application software a client application or device driver printer driver in case of printer . The output manager may include management and control capabilities with hardware and software components including for example one or more communication chipsets residing in its host information apparatus.

The output manager in the information apparatus may be capable of communicating with managing and synchronizing data or software components with an output device equipped with an output controller of present invention. Examples of output devices include without limitation printers fax machines copiers image or video display devices monitors display screens projectors and audio output devices.

The output controller may be a circuit board card or software components residing in an output device. Alternatively the output controller may be connected externally to an output device as an external component or box. The output controller may be implemented with one or a combination of embedded processor software firmware ASIC DSP FPGA system on a chip special chipsets among others. In another embodiment the functionality of the output controller may be provided by application software running on a PC workstation or server connected externally to an output device.

The output controller may include a processing unit memory storage unit and communication adapter unit among others. The storage or memory unit of the output controller may store device drivers software components or objects encapsulating device dependent data algorithms and code. Device dependent data may be for example parameters and information about the output device and output controller. Software components and objects may encapsulate for example code or executables of algorithms necessary for converting or encoding an image or document description or language into print data or output data compatible with a specific output device. The output manager may manage the process of uploading data and or software components from an output controller to an information apparatus in order to for example enable the information apparatus to generate and transmit print data or output data accurately to the output device or the output controller.

Output data or print data in the case where the output device is a printer may be specific data instructions page description language markup language graphics and or image file format among others. Print data may also be encoded or compressed with one or more compression or encoding techniques. Furthermore print data may use one or more open standards or one or more proprietary techniques and formats or a combination. Output data or print data for printers refers to the electronic data sent from an information apparatus to the output device.

One implementation of a digital content output process of this invention includes the following steps.

3. The information apparatus exchanges service information with output controllers associated with the available output devices in a service negotiation process. The user may then select one or more output devices based on the service information provided.

4. The information apparatus communicates with output controller to identify and upload the necessary components to enable output to a specific output device as part of a synchronization process. The uploaded components or data may then be installed or configured in the information apparatus.

5. The digital content intended for output is processed by one or more components to be compatible with the output device. The one or more components include the information apparatus with an output manager an output controller and the output device.

In the output process of present invention an output manager residing in the information apparatus may participate in coordinate and manage the communication and exchange of information components between its host information apparatus and output controllers.

Information apparatus may contain components not shown such as a processing unit a memory unit a storage unit and an input output control unit as are known in the art. Information apparatus may also contain an interface not shown for interactions with users. The interface may be implemented in software or hardware or a combination. Examples of such an interface include without limitation a mouse a keyboard a touch sensitive or non touch sensitive screen one or more push buttons soft keys a stylus a speaker a microphone etc.

An information apparatus may be a dedicated single task device e.g. email terminal web terminal e book etc or a general purpose computing device with multiple features and functions. These multiple functions and features may be implemented by one or more software applications e.g. applications installed in the information apparatus which may or may not include an operating system. A digital camera equipped with processing capability and feature sets of the present invention is also an example of an information apparatus .

Some information apparatuses e.g. dedicated devices may be pre configured by manufacturers with fixed functionalities and features. Other information apparatuses may allow users to install additional hardware components and application software e.g. applications to expand or change functionality. Examples of functionalities and applications of information apparatuses may include for example e mail messaging voice communication web browsing image acquisition text processing graphics applications document or image editing and output functionalities among others.

Functionalities and feature sets of an information apparatus may be implemented in software or hardware or a combination of both. When features are implemented in software this software may be installed by the manufacturer or by users. Application software may be implemented using embedded software running on embedded processors or it may run on a specific operating system. Some or all or combinations of applications and feature sets may also be implemented in hardware or in silicon. Some functionality or feature sets may be implemented in special chip sets and may include one or more or combinations of for example application specific integrated circuits ASICs field programmable gate arrays FPGAs digital signal processors DSPs systems on a chip firmwares etc.

Information apparatus may or may not contain an operating system. In an implementation having an operating system the operating system may provide a variety of application programming interfaces APIs or object models e.g. APIs for software applications to interface and communicate with device drivers. Device drivers in an information apparatus control and communicate with peripheral devices such as printers copiers fax machines display monitors screens etc. Several different applications can share a common device driver through the use of APIs or interfaces or object models provided by an operating system as described below with reference to . In implementations having no operating system or an operating system that does not support or provide a device driver API each application may have to implement its own device driver or its own output and communication capability as described below with reference to . For example to output a digital document to a printer each application may have to implement its own printer specific driving processing and or communication capability.

In one implementation information apparatus includes an output manager which is typically implemented in software. Output manager may be implemented or included in a client application or as a stand alone application or as part of another application software B or in the form of a device driver e.g. a printer driver in case of a printer being the output device which may be invoked shared and used by one or more application software programs .

One task for output manager is to manage and coordinate communication between information apparatus and one or more output controllers . Output manager may for example implement an open standard or a proprietary communication protocol to directly or indirectly interact with manage or utilize functionalities provided by hardware components residing in a host information apparatus . Such hardware components may include for example a processing unit a memory unit and communication chipsets not shown . Output manager may include one or more of the following features and functionalities 

Output manager may communicate and interact with one or more software applications included in a host information apparatus to provide pervasive output capability or feature to those software applications . The type of information passed from the software applications to the output manager may be for example a digital document or digital content data that needs output. In some instances application software may invoke or launch the output manager as a separate application as shown in or as an integrated part of the application software as shown in . Examples of possible communication and management between output manager and application software may include among others messages objects models instances procedural calls program invocation and APIs which may or may not be provided by an operating system.

Output manager may manage and maintain wired or wireless communications with output controller . Output manager may interact with functionalities implemented by hardware components of its host information apparatus . As an example the output manager may manage and interact with the communication unit in the information apparatus . show an example of communication units using wireless adapters as described below in greater detail. A user may interact with the output manager through a user interlace provided by output manager through the host information apparatus .

Output manager may help discover available output devices verify communication connections identify devices available or compatible for service or send or broadcast service requests to one or more devices.

Output manager may communicate with output controller to identify necessary software components data or any other device dependent information or parameters if any that need to be uploaded from the output controller to the host information apparatus to enable pervasive output. Software components may be for example a device driver an application a special code or algorithm an executable object or device dependent data parameter information etc.

Output manager may coordinate with output controller to upload the necessary components or data from the output controller to its host information apparatus so that the user can output digital content pervasively to that output controller or its associated output device .

Output manager may perform raster image processing operations e.g. rasterization color management half toning operations or convert digital content from its original format into print data compatible for input to a specific output controller or output device . The digital content may be created stored or received by the information apparatus . For example an output manager may convert digital document information from a certain format or language into a specific print data or intermediate format or language such as PostScript PCL EMF XML TIFF JPEG RTL among others for output.

Output manager may coordinate or manage the communication between a host information apparatus and output controller to send or transmit the print data to the output controller .

An output controller may be implemented as software or hardware and may be connected to or integrated within an output device . Output controllers H illustrate hardware implementations in the form of a circuit board or card that is installed or integrated into an output device such as a printer copiers fax machine display screen among others. In another configuration not shown output controller may be implemented as a software application or component that is installed or integrated into an output device . Output controller G illustrates a hardware implementation in the form of an external component or box that is separately connected to one or more output devices .

Whether externally connected to or internally installed in output device output controller may be implemented with hardware software or both that perform the feature sets and functionalities of the output controller described herein. In the case of output device being a printer output controller can also sometimes be called a printer server. Exemplary configurations and implementations of output controller are described below with reference to .

As one example output controller may be implemented as a computer connected to one or more output devices . For example a conventional PC workstation or server may serve the purpose of an output controller . In this case the functionalities of output controller may be implemented using application software installed in the computer PC server or workstation with the computer connected to the output device .

An output controller installed or connected to an output device such as a printer enables the output device to communicate and negotiate services with information apparatus . In one implementation an information apparatus may communicate with an output controller connected to a printer or an output controller internally installed within a printer to obtain device dependent data or software components such as device specific printer driver. An application such as an output manager residing in the information apparatus may install and configure the uploaded components or data allowing information apparatus to print to that printer directly. An example of an output process is described below with reference to .

Provide service to clients Output controller may actively search for available clients including information apparatus or output manager or other communication units to which clients output service could be provided. Alternatively or in combination an output controller may passively wait to be discovered by one or more clients including information apparatus to provide output service to the client or clients.

Negotiation of services with information apparatus Output controller may communicate and exchange information with information apparatus as part of negotiating the output services to be provided. As an example in communication with an information apparatus an output controller may inform the information apparatus of the make model identification version type of input language type of device driver software type of services provided type of components available for upload etc. for a selected output device such as a printer. As another example an information apparatus may send one or more messages to an output controller inquiring about what software component or data if any the information apparatus needs to upload from the output controller to enable output to a specific output device .

Provide security functionalities such as authentication and encryption Authentication is used to prevent unwanted access to services while encryption is used to prevent eavesdropping. Security procedures may be implemented by software hardware or a combination of both in various steps and stages of communication between the output controller or the output device and the information apparatus .

Payment or transaction management and services A user may be charged a service fee when for example providing output to a printer or other output device . Output controller may have the ability to calculate and process payment according to the services requested by or rendered to a client. Output controller may process payments in various forms such as cash E cash credit card debit card E card smart card virtual cash etc.

Storage capability Output controller may include a memory or storage unit and may store within it one or more of the following application software device or printer driver software components device dependent data or parameters user interfaces etc. Software components or data stored in the output device or the output controller may be uploaded to the information apparatus in order for the information apparatus or the output manager to drive the output device . Software components may be executable or partially executable programs or data.

Synchronize with information apparatus After output controller or the output manager in information apparatus identifies the components software component data information or parameters necessary to enable output or printing the output controller may coordinate with the output manager to upload to the information apparatus the components stored in a memory or storage unit of output controller .

Provide management tools Multiple information apparatuses may request service from the same output device at the same time or at overlapping times. Management tools such as queuing and spooling of print jobs quality of service etc. may be provided by the output controller .

As indicated above output controller may be implemented in a variety of ways and may include hardware software or a combination of the two. In hardware implementations for example output controller may include components using one or more of hardware types such as ASIC DSP FPGA firmware system on a chip and communication chip set. Output controller may also include embedded processors with software components or embedded application software to implement its feature sets and functionalities. An output controller may or may not contain an operating system.

Output controller typically includes a memory or storage unit ROM RAM flash memory disk drive not shown which may store one or more software applications software components and data. Some software applications may run in the output controller to perform its functionalities e.g. communicate with information apparatus .

The memory or storage unit of an output controller may also store data and one or more software components that may be available to be uploaded to or synchronized with an information apparatus during communication with output manager . A software component may be a device driver or complete application software that can run on the information apparatus . Once such a software component is uploaded and installed the information apparatus can drive or output to that specific output device .

A software component may also be a partial device driver or partial application software or partial software component. A software component may be an executable or partially executable program object or code. Software components may encapsulate information algorithms and data. Examples of algorithms that may be included in the software components include compression decompression methods file conversion graphics representation and rendering image processing and enhancement operations color space transformation and data conversion encoding decoding techniques color matching and management methods image transformation interpolation methods halftoning techniques user interface software codes etc. Examples of data that may be included in software components include for example a color table color space information halftoning tables output device type output resolution bit depth input type format or language communication protocol type output status device identification and signature graphics image and text descriptions etc.

Such software components may be uploaded to output manager to facilitate communication and generation of print data or output data suitable compatible or optimized for the output controller or the output device . The output controller and output manager manage and negotiate the proper components to be uploaded to the information apparatus .

Not all situations require uploading an entire or complete driver or application to output manager or information apparatus . In some implementations uploading only a software component may be sufficient. For example there are many inkjet printers that commonly use one bit or multi bit CMYK printing technology and sometimes have similar resolutions. An information apparatus may pre install a more generic printer driver where this printer driver contains the device independent portion of the software code algorithms and data that is common or can be used for this entire class of printers. Device independent code may include for example a rasterization process including half toning and color management methods and image enhancement of the digital document that is suitable for use with this entire class of printers. In this example it is feasible to upload only a smaller software component or data that includes the device dependent components for a particular printer or output device . The device dependent portion or component or data may include but is not limited to color tables halftoning tables output resolution bit depth compression decompression methods color space conversion encoding algorithms or conversion software that is specific to that printer or output device .

Another example of a software component stored in the memory unit of an output controller for uploading to an information apparatus is an installation wizard or a user interface to capture a user s preferences for printing or output operation. Examples of user preferences in the case of printing may include without limitation color and print quality parameter adjustments number of copies number of cards per page number of pages per sheet duplex portrait or landscape security information etc.

Once the software components or data are uploaded or installed in information apparatus the information apparatus can drive or output to the output device . For example an application in the information apparatus can print a digital document or image to a printer.

Different information apparatuses may require different software components to be uploaded in order to drive a specific output device . Accordingly a variety of software components and data or device drivers for a plurality of information apparatuses operating systems and platform types may be stored in the memory or storage components of an output controller .

Output controller may contain an embedded operating system to manage its applications. With an operating system some or all functionalities and feature sets of the output controller may be implemented as application software. Additional application software may be installed or upgraded to newer versions in order to for example provide additional functionalities or bug fixes.

Output controller may contain a user interface that allows a user to configure and manage the functions provided by the output controller . The user interface of the output controller maybe accomplished by for example using display screens soft keys pushbuttons mouse stylus and keypads to allow users to interact with and manage the functions provided by the output controller . Examples of such functions may include any or all of an on off power switch status display or indicator cancel current job or reorder existing jobs etc.

Output controller typically also includes a communication or adapter unit which allows output controller to communicate with other devices including information apparatus through wired or wireless connections. Exemplary configurations of wireless adapter or communication unit are described below with reference to .

When output controller is implemented as firmware or an embedded application the configuration and management of the functionalities of output controller may be optionally accomplished by for example using controller management software in a host computer not shown . A host computer may be a desktop personal computer PC workstation or server. The host computer may be connected locally or through a network to the output device or controller . Communication between the host computer and output controller can be accomplished through wired or wireless communication. The management application software in the host computer can manage the settings configurations and feature sets of the output controller . Furthermore a host computer configuration application may download or install application software software components or data in the output controller for the purpose of upgrading updating and or modifying the features and capabilities of the output controller .

Output device in one implementation includes or is connected to output controller described above. Therefore functionalities and feature sets provided by output controller are automatically included as part of the functionalities of output device . The output device may however implement or include other controllers or applications that provide at least partially the features and functionalities of the output controller .

Therefore the output device may include some or all of the functionalities and feature sets provided by the output controller .

Output device is an electronic system capable of outputting digital content regardless of whether the output medium is a substrate e.g. paper a display image a projection or sound. A typical example of output device may be a printer which outputs digital documents containing text graphics images or any combination onto a substrate. Output device may also be a display device capable of displaying still images or video such as without limitation televisions monitors and projectors. Output device can also be a device capable of outputting sound. Any device capable of playing or reading digital content in audio e.g. music or data e.g. text or document formats is also a possible output device . A printer including a fax machine copier etc. is frequently referred to herein as the exemplary output device . However it should be recognized that the present invention applies as well to output devices other than printers.

Marking engine may use any of a variety of different technologies to transform a rasterized image to paper or other media or in other words to transfer colorant to a substrate. The different marking or printing technologies that may be used include both impact and non impact printing. Examples of impact printing may include dot matrix Teletype daisywheel etc. Non impact printing technologies may include inkjet laser electrostatic thermal dye sublimation etc.

Marking engine and memory buffer of a printer form its printer engine which may also include additional circuitry and components such as firmware software and or chips or chipsets for decoding and signal conversion etc. not shown . Input to a printer engine is usually a final rasterized print data generated by the raster image processor . Such input is usually device dependent and printer specific. The printer engine may take this device dependent input and generate output pages.

Raster image processor RIP may be located within the printing device itself as shown in or externally implemented as hardware software or a combination. As an example RIP may be implemented in a software application or device driver in the information apparatus. A RIP may also reside within a printer controller a print server or an output controller of present invention. Examples of raster image processing operations may include image and graphics interpretation rasterization segmentation color space transformation image enhancement color correction halftoning etc.

When a RIP is located inside an output device the RIP is usually included in a printer controller that may for example interpret convert and or rasterize input print data into a final format language or instructions that printer engine can understand. A laser printer with a faster printing speed is an example that falls in this category. For example a PostScript printer controller may contain a postscript interpreter not shown and a raster image processor RIP . Postscript interpreter interpret the postscript language and the raster image processor may process the digital document and converting it to a printer specific format language or instructions that can be accepted by the printer engine . In this example a device dependent printer driver e.g. a Postscript driver not shown may be needed in the information apparatus to convert digital document from its original format into print data e.g. in PostScript that is acceptable to the printer controller .

Another example of page description language is PCL Printer Command Language from HP Hewlett Packard . In the same way as postscript a printer equipped with PCL printer controller can take PCL as input. Information apparatus usually needs to have PCL printer driver in order to drive or print to a printer equipped with a PCL controller.

Although the illustrations above use PostScript and PCL as examples a variety of other page description languages markup languages image formats graphics formats and file formats may also be used as input print data to a printer or output device . Examples of possible inputs other than PostScript and PCL may include without limitation EMF XML HTML among many others. Some printer manufacturers may also use a combination of proprietary or nonproprietary page description languages markup languages file formats graphics and image formats color spaces metafiles encoding decoding compression or decompression etc. for the print data . Print data sent to printers with printer controllers are usually intermediate descriptions of a digital document that may require further interpretation processing and or conversion before it can be send a printer engine for output. A printer controller may interpret and process the input intermediate print data information into the final format that can be understood by the printer engine . Regardless of the type of print data users usually have to pre install a device specific driver in their information apparatus in order to output the proper language format or file that can be accepted by a specific printer .

Some output devices B do not have a printer controller as shown in . A typical example is a lower cost inkjet printer. RIP in this example may be implemented in a software application or device driver or output manager of present invention in the information apparatus . Therefore the rasterization process may occur in the information apparatus that outputs to such a printer. A device specific driver or application may need to reside in the information apparatus to rasterize and convert the digital document from its original format into final print data B e.g. compressed CMKY data with one or more bits per pixel that can be understood by a particular printer engine B.

In present invention for the printer B RIP can be integrated within the output manager or application software in the information apparatus . Alternatively RIP may also be integrated as a part or a function of any one of output controllers as shown in configurations D E and F.

The output controller may be connected externally to an output device or integrated internally into the output device . If an output device such as a printer already includes a printer controller the output controller may be implemented serially or cascaded with the printer controller as two separate controllers. Alternatively output controller can be integrated with a printer controller to become a combined controller C. A combined controller e.g. C or F has functionalities of both printer controller e.g. input interpretation and or raster image processing and output controller of the present invention. Other configurations and implementations of output controller and printer controller are also possible. The various possible configurations and implementations of output controller are described below with reference to .

Communication links and between information apparatus with an output controller whether externally connected and or internally integrated may be variously implemented. In one implementation information apparatus communicates with output controller through wireless connections such as infrared or radio links. Examples of wireless connections technology include without limitation IrDA home RF Bluetooth IEEE 802.11 HiperLan2 among others. However wired connections such as serial interfaces parallel interfaces USB interfaces Fire Wire IEEE 1394 Ethernet and token ring network among others may also be implemented in the present invention. Adapter pairs may be incorporated into each communicating node e.g. information apparatus and output controller to conduct communications by performing signal conversions.

In the case that output controller is installed as an external component or box as shown in the communication link between output controller and output device may also be implemented using wired or wireless adapters.

RF link controller implements real time lower layer e.g. physical layer protocol processing that enables the hosts e.g. information apparatus output controller output device etc. to communicate over a radio link. Functions performed by the link controller may include without limitation error detection correction power control data packet processing data encryption decryption and other data processing functions.

A variety of radio links may be utilized including a group of competing technologies operating in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency band. This group currently includes Bluetooth Home radio frequency Home RF and implementations based on the IEEE 802.11 standard. Each of these technologies has a different set of protocols and they all provide solutions for wireless local area networks LANs . Interference among these technologies could limit deployment of these protocols simultaneously. It is anticipated that new local area wireless technologies may emerge or that the existing ones may converge. Nevertheless all theses existing and future wireless technologies may be implemented in the present invention to transmit data between different devices without limitation and therefore in no way depart from the scope of present invention.

Among the current available wireless technologies Bluetooth requires relatively lower power consumption. Bluetooth has its own protocol stack and is designed for short range 10 meters point to multipoint voice and data transfer. It is based on a frequency hopping version of spread spectrum. Seventy nine hop frequencies are utilized beginning at the lowest frequency of 2402 MHz and each of the 79 hop frequencies is 1 MHz above the next lower frequency. Bluetooth enabled devices operate in piconets in which several devices using the same hopping pattern or sequence are connected in a point to multipoint system piconet . One device master in each piconet determines how the bandwidth is allocated to other devices slaves . As many as 10 piconets of 8 devices each can operate simultaneously.

Referring to infrared IR adapters may be implemented to enable data transmission among devices through infrared transmission. The IR adapters may be conveniently implemented in accordance with the Infrared Data Association IrDA standards and specifications. In general the IrDA standard is used to provide wireless connectivity technologies for devices that would normally use cables for connection. The IrDA standard is a point to point vs. point to multipoint as in Bluetooth narrow angle ad hoc data transmission standard designed to operate over a distance of 0 to 1 meter and at speeds up to 4 Mbps.

Configuration of infrared adapters may vary depending on the intended rate of data transfer. illustrates one embodiment of infrared adapter . Transceiver receives emits IR signals and converts IR signals to from electrical signals. A UART universal asynchronous receiver transmitter performs the function of serialization deserialization converting serial data stream to from data bytes. The UART is connected to the IR transceiver by encoder decoder ENDEC . This configuration is generally suitable for transferring data at relatively low rate for example 115.2 kbps or below. Other components e.g. packet framer phase locked loop may be needed for higher data transfer rates.

As shown in email application A document creation application A and Internet browsing application A referred to generally or together as application software may operate on top of or through an operating system included in the information apparatus . The operating system provides or supports API s or object models for these software applications to communicate with and access utilities and services provided by output manager . Application software and output manager may communicate with each other through a variety of means using for example file transfer metafile messages instances procedural calls etc. which may or may not be provided by the operating system or its API s or object models . The output manager communicates and synchronizes with output controller to enable pervasive output. Therefore a user may output digital contents from any of these software applications email document creation Internet browsing etc. to an output device equipped with or connected to output controller .

It should be recognized that the three software applications illustrated in are merely examples of applications that may be included in the information apparatus . Various other software applications e.g. messaging digital imaging graphics video audio etc. may also exist in the same information apparatus and they may all access the utilities provided by the output manager . It should also be recognized that other device management applications or drivers might also be included in the information apparatus . These device management applications or drivers may be implemented in the same way as output manager so that they can be accessed by other software applications supported by the operating system.

Instead of integrating the output manager into application software an alternative implementation is shown in . The software applications C C may establish direct links with the output manager which may be used as a helper program that can be invoked or launched by each software application as needed.

The communication and exchange of information between output manager and other software applications can be accomplished by one or more of many available techniques such as passing transferring or exchanging objects messages procedural calls files metafiles etc. Some of these techniques may be facilitated by a set of APIs or object models provided by the application software or output manager or the operating system. The exact technique may depend for example on the type of application platform language and developer preference etc. This may be easily implemented and recognized by an average software engineer skilled in the art.

The above are merely exemplary implementations of output manager . Due to the diversity of feature sets and capabilities of operating systems other implementations of output manager are also possible. As an example some operating systems may provide partial APIs or object models to support limited output capability. In this case software applications may rely on the limited output capacity to interact with device management applications or the software applications can implement or incorporate partially other desired output features of the output manager using the configurations or combination of configuration illustrated in or C.

Some printers do not include a raster image processor or printer controller as illustrated in and as a result are usually less expensive. An example of this type of printer is a low cost desktop inkjet printer. This type of printer may use a proprietary or published input format. For example the input to an inkjet printer may consist of specific proprietary compressed CMYK data with one or more bits per pixel input. Application software or printer drivers included in information apparatus usually perform raster image processing. It is therefore necessary that the proper device driver or application software runs the raster image processing on an information apparatus before printing. Accordingly output controller may be implemented into a variety of printing systems including printers without capable or complete printer controllers for performing raster image processing functions.

The above are exemplary implementations of output controller but other implementations are also possible. For example partial functionalities of output controller may be implemented in an external box while the remaining functionalities may reside within an output device as a separate circuit board or integrated with a printer controller. As another example the functionalities of output controller may be implemented into a plurality of external boxes connected to the same output device . As a further example the same output controller may be connected to and service multiple output devices .

Step indicates that a user initiates output from an information apparatus . For example a user may want to print or otherwise output an email receipt confirmation map photo graphics web page one or more slides of a PowerPoint brand presentation or any other document or digital content from an information apparatus . The output may be initiated by various means such as by using a soft key push button keyboard keypad mouse stylus software GUI command or voice activated command etc. An exemplary user interface with which a user may initiate such a process from an information apparatus is described below with reference to . Step and one or more other steps of output process shown in may be implemented by an output manager residing in a user s information apparatus .

Step references a discovery process in which for example information apparatus searches for available output devices including display devices printers copiers or fax machines among others collectively refer to as printers here for simplicity of discussion that can perform a requested output or print job. The output manager residing in the information apparatus may participate in coordinate and manage the discovery process . As part of discovery process information apparatus may communicate via a wired or wireless connection with output controllers that are connected to or included in output devices .

In some situations the discovery process or part of it may be skipped. For example discovery process may be skipped if a user already knows the output device or printer to which output is to be directed. As another example a user may set a frequently used printer as a preferred default printer so that discovery process may be partly skipped if the default printer is found to be available. Other examples in which discovery process may be optional or partly skipped involve direct wire line connections or infrared communications. In these cases a user may directly connect or physically point an information apparatus to a specific output device so that it could be sufficient only to check the connection and establish communication between the devices.

Discovery process may operate in a variety of scenarios. In one scenario information apparatus broadcasts a service request for example printing through wired or wireless signals. Service devices such as output device equipped with output controller listen to such signals read the request see whether they can provide requested service and respond if they can provide the requested service. Alternatively or in combination all service devices can periodically or continuously announce or advertise the services they provide. Information apparatus listens to such announcements and identifies the service it needs. In a third scenario service devices of the same network e.g. LAN register their services with a control point. A control point is a computing system e.g. a server controller that maintains records on all service devices within the same network. Information apparatus may contact the control point to search for the service it needs.

Various protocols may be implemented in the discovery process . Wireless communication protocols are preferred. Wired communication on the other hand may also be implemented. Examples of applicable protocols may include without limitation Bluetooth HAVi Jini Salutation Service Location Protocol and Universal Plug and play among others. Other proprietary protocols or combinations may also be implemented in the discovery process.

In the discovery process information apparatus may or may not find an output device available to accept its print or output job. Exemplary factors that may impact the availability of output devices may include without limitation the following 

Physical distance Some wireless communication links may impose limitations on physical distance between communicating devices. The restrictions on physical distance may vary among different wireless communication technologies. Wired communication on the other hand is also subject to the availability and length of cable or other wired lines.

Compatibility The output process with reference to employs communication and coordination among various devices such as an information apparatus having output manager and output controllers associated with output devices . Compatible hardware and software components may need to reside in each of the communicating nodes e.g. information apparatus and output device . Any missing part may cause compatibility problems. Other factors may also cause lack of compatibility. For example components stored in the memory unit of output controller may not support the operating system or application software included in the information apparatus .

Security authentication Security authentication may be implemented in various steps of communication including the discovery step . Security authentication may be required for example when an output service is restricted to a certain group of users or information apparatuses. When a user requests service output device or output controller may process an authentication step by automatically detecting the identification or other information provided by the user output manager or information apparatus . As a result of such an authentication process the information apparatus of a particular user may not be able to discover an available output device because access is not authorized for the user or the apparatus.

User specified search criteria The user may specify certain search criteria for discovery process such as output device model quality of service provided range or price of service charge etc. Output devices not satisfying user criteria or a default profile may not be shown to the user.

Step indicates that the user is notified if no available output device is found in the discovery process . The user may be notified by an application such as the output manager through a user interface of the information apparatus . The information apparatus may also provide more detailed information such as the reasons why the requested service is not available. Examples of possible reasons may include among others no output device within limited physical distance no compatible hardware or software components technical difficulties security authentication not satisfied no subscription to the service search criteria not met etc.

Step indicates that alternatives are provided when a requested service is not available at the current moment. The user may be provided with alternatives such as canceling the service request trying again or being notified when the requested service is available or the requested output device is identified or becomes available. As an example the user s information apparatus may not detect any available output devices in the current wired wireless network. The print requests are then queued or registered within the information apparatus . When the user enters a new network having available printers or when new compatible printers are added to the current network or when a printer becomes available for any reason the user would be notified of such availability through the information apparatus . The user may then output the print job to the newly detected or now available printer with for example a mere click of a button. This detection and notification function may be implemented by a software program or as a feature of the output manager . This feature may also be implemented in hardware or combination of hardware and software residing in the information apparatus .

Step indicates that service negotiation is performed such as when one or more available printers are discovered in the discovery process . In service negotiation process information apparatus exchanges information with output controllers connected to or installed in the available output devices . The output manager may participate in coordinate or manage negotiation process with output controller . Information being exchanged may include for example the following 

Type make and model of each available output device including information about the printer engine its technology and specifications of the output device.

Type and parameters of the output device such as font or international character code supported paper size resolution bit depth color space number of colors supported color or grayscale etc.

Conditions under which the services are provided e.g. service charge subscription charge and whether for example transaction and service charges are satisfied.

Whether the usage or service of each output device is restricted to certain groups in which case the user may have to provide authentication information to be identified as member of such a group before use of that device is allowed.

The type of input format encoding language data color space and or compression that the output controller or other device may take as input for example PostScript PCL RTL XML etc.

The type of component or data that may need to be uploaded from output controller to information apparatus so as to enable output to a specific output device.

The information being exchanged may be entered manually by the user or may be automatically detected and or synchronized between the information apparatus and the output controller or it may be partially assisted by the user or partially automated. Some or all of the information being exchanged may be provided to the user through a user interlace in the information apparatus . The user may monitor the status or approve certain transactions. One embodiment of the service negotiation process is described below with reference to . Based on the information provided and obtained in the service negotiation process the user may choose one or more output devices that can take the print or output job.

Step indicates that a synchronization process is performed once an output device has been identified and selected. Before synchronization process begins the information apparatus may communicate with the output controller or controllers of the selected output device or devices to identify what components if any need to be uploaded to the information apparatus to enable printing or other output. This communication between information apparatus and output controller or controllers may not be necessary if adequate information has been obtained in the discovery process and or service negotiation process . Synchronization process may be optional or it may be partially skipped if the necessary components e.g. identified in the service negotiation step already exist in information apparatus .

After they have been identified the necessary components or parts of components or data may be uploaded to the information apparatus from output controller . Examples of possible components may include without limitation one or more of the following data device driver printer driver application software software components metafiles user interface etc. The output manager may participate in coordinate or manage the synchronization process . Encryption techniques may be implemented in the synchronization process to prevent eavesdropping.

The newly uploaded components may be incorporated into the output manager residing in the user s information apparatus . Alternatively or in combination the newly uploaded components may be installed into the information apparatus as a separate application or as part of the output manager . The process of uploading and installing may be done automatically or manually by the user or a combination of the two.

Part or all of synchronization process may be skipped in some instances. For example the information apparatus may already include all the software components and data or drivers necessary for output to the selected output device or devices . This may be due to the components having been uploaded from a previous synchronization process and left undeleted or alternatively the user may have preinstalled all the necessary components for output in the information apparatus . In these cases no software components are being uploaded and the user may be notified of this status for possible override of synchronization process . Alternatively synchronization process may be automatically skipped transparently to the user.

Step indicates that print or output job processing is performed. In this step the print request or print job is processed and digital content or document may be converted to the final format to send to the output device for output. At the beginning of this step the user may be provided with options to select or change or input printing or output preferences such as page layout number of copies color grayscale print quality parameters etc. These options may include or offer pre configured user preferences or factory defaults. Some options parameters and preferences may be device dependent while others may be device independent. For example device dependent parameters and preferences may be presented after having synchronized or uploaded device dependent components or information from the output controller . Device independent parameters and preferences may also be uploaded and synchronized like the device dependent parameters and preferences or may be pre installed as part of the output manager prior to the synchronization and uploading of information.

With reference to output controller may be implemented in a variety of ways. Different implementations of output controller may impact the procedures described here. The original digital document or content included or generated in an application in information apparatus may be processed by different applications in different locations application software output manager output controller printer controller before being converted to a final print data that can be accepted by a printer engine for output. For example raster image processing of the digital document to convert it to print data suitable to output device may occur entirely or partially in application software output manager output controller or the printer controller depending on the implementation configuration and the type of output system and output device among others. Different processing procedures and embodiments that may be implemented in this step are described in more detail below with reference to .

Step indicates that the printer engine or display engine generates a final output. In this step the processing result of step is sent to a printer engine or display engine of an output device to generate final output on a substrate for example. Memory buffers may be needed to temporarily store print data before output. Firmware DSP ASIC FPGA system on a chip software or a combination may be used or involved to convert digital data into signals suitable for the printer engine or display engine .

After a print job or output job has been successfully printed or displayed the user may be provided a choice not shown to delete the components that have been uploaded to the information apparatus during the synchronization process . This optional feature may be useful when the information apparatus has limited storage space. One implementation of this optional feature is to provide a setting in the output manager in which the user has a choice to 1 always keep the uploaded data or components or 2 always automatically delete the uploaded data or components upon completion of the print job or upon exit of the application or upon shutting down of the information apparatus or upon elapse of certain amount of time or 3 always ask the user whether to delete or keep the uploaded component or data.

The above description illustrates an exemplary embodiment of output process . A printer is referred to as output device in the above illustration however it should be recognized that output process could be easily applied to other output devices such as fax machines digital copiers display screens TVs monitors projectors voice output devices etc.

A pervasive output process implementing fewer or additional steps may also be possible. For example step the discovery process may be skipped if the user already knows which printer or printers are to output the content. As another example a payment processing step may be added to the above described output process if the printing service is provided for a fee. Output controller in this case may provide services such as calculating payment amount or collecting payments in a variety of possible forms for example credit card bank card cash E cash smart card among others. The payment information e.g. credit card number or other credit identification or payment may be stored in the information apparatus and released to the output controller at the user s choice. Adding additional processes or skipping one or more steps in output process does not however depart from the spirit and scope of present invention.

The output manager residing in the information apparatus may participate in coordinate and manage the service negotiation process together with the output controller .

In step the user may be provided at information apparatus with information on some or all available output devices identified in the discovery process . Information being provided here may include one or more of the following 

Conditions under which the services are provided. For example if service charge or subscription fee is required and the acceptable payment method.

The components or information if any need to be uploaded to the information apparatus to enable output to the selected output devices.

Information collected during discovery process may be provided to the user through a user interface on the information apparatus such as a GUI or voice or another interlace.

In step based on some or all of the information provided the user may choose one or more output devices to take the print request or print job. On the other hand the user may choose to decline the output service offered and choose not to output the document or content to any of those devices. In this case alternatives may be provided to the user as previously described with reference to step .

Authentication step is optional but may be necessary if for example the use of an output device is restricted to a group of users. In this case the user may have to provide authentication information to identify him herself as part of the authorized group to use the service. Examples of authentication methods may include a user s name password personal identification number PIN ID number signatures security keys physical or digital biometric fingerprint voice etc. ID number or IP address of the information apparatus may also be used as authentication information. Such authentication information may be provided by the user manually or detected automatically by the output controller or output device .

It should be recognized that only provides one embodiment of the service negotiation process of present invention. A service negotiation process having fewer or additional steps may also be possible. As an example step authentication may not be necessary if the use of an output device is not restricted. As another example one or more steps such as credit verification payment deposit escrow and receipt processing may be added to the negotiation process if a service charge is involved. All these and other possible variations however shall not depart from the spirit and scope of present invention.

In step output manager processes an input digital document or content and converts it to print data that can be transmitted to output controller combined controller C F or directly to printer engine . Rasterization interpretation encoding decoding etc. may take place in this step. In one implementation print data may utilize an intermediate format or language to facilitate the transmission of the digital document or content to the output controller . This intermediate format or language may be a predefined input format or language that the output controller can understand. It is also possible in this step that the output manager simply passes the digital document in its original format to the output controller with little processing. In still another exemplary implementation the output manager may process e.g. raster image process the digital content or document into a final print data or output data format compatible to the input requirements of the output device . Encryption techniques may be used to assure the security of communication between information apparatus and output devices .

As indicated above output data or print data in case of a printer generated by step may be in various formats. In one embodiment the print data may be in a final format suitable for sending directly to the printer engine. In this case the output controller does little or no processing. One exemplary use of this configuration can be implemented in a low cost inkjet printer that does not have a printer controller. In this example the print data may be in a compressed 1 bit or more CMYK data format that can be sent directly to the printer engine for final output as shown in step . Or print data can be sent to the output controller for possible optional features such as buffering queuing and print job management as shown in step .

In another embodiment output manager may generate print data in an intermediate format language or instruction that requires further processing. Examples of such format language or instruction may include without limitations Page description languages e.g. PostScript PCL metafiles e.g. EMF markup languages e.g. XML HTML image or graphics formats TIFF GIF PNG JPEG compressed among others. The intermediate format may also include proprietary solutions in page description languages markup languages metafiles image and graphics formats encoding and decoding compression and decompression. The above mentioned intermediate formats may be used independently or in combinations.

As described above with reference to output controller may be implemented in a variety of ways. Different implementations of output controller may impact the processing procedures described here with reference to .

As shown in step the print data is sent directly to the printer or display engine for final output with little or no further processing from output controller or a printer controller . In this case the print data or output data is preferably to be in a final format or language that can be understood by the printer or display engine that is part of the selected output devices or devices .

Alternatively as shown in step print data is sent to an output controller connected to or installed within a selected printer or output device . In one embodiment the print data may be in a final format or language that can be understood and processed by the printer or display engine . In this case the output controller may buffer the input print data before passing it to the printer or display engine with little or no further processing. In another embodiment print data maybe in an intermediate format or language not understood by the printer or output engine . Therefore the output controller may process the print data and convert it into a final format language or instruction that can be sent to the printer engine or other output engine in the case of other type of output device .

Regardless of the format of input print data the output controller may perform additional management functions such as payment processing service verification authentication print job management queuing spooling quality of service among others.

As illustrated in step and the print data may be processed by both output controller in step and printer controller in step separately before being sent to the printer engine for final output. For example some printers such as high speed laser printers already include a printer controller that has the capability of processing certain types of input such as PostScript PCL and XML among others. In this case the output controller may process or convert the print data into the input required by the printer controller . Alternatively in a different implementation if the print data is already in one of the formats or languages that are compatible and can be understood by the printer controller the output controller may simply buffer the print data and sent it directly to the printer controller as needed with little or no processing. In step the printer controller may perform functions such as interpretation decoding and raster image processing operations on the input print data such as a page description language if such operations were not already performed by output controller or by output manager . The processed result of the printer controller may be sent to the printer engine for final output.

As illustrated in step a single combined controller F C as illustrated in that combines the functionalities of output controller and a printer controller may process the print data. Applications that provide feature sets for each controller may share the same resources such as processor memory space storage unit etc. Under this configuration the combined controller C F may further process the print data in step if the print data is not already in the format or language required by printer engine. The combined controller C F may need to perform interpretation decoding and rasterization operations in addition to converting the input print data in one or more of intermediate formats described previously to the required format language or instruction of the printer engine for output. If the print data is already in the final format language or instruction understood by the printer engine the combined controller C F might simply buffer the print data and send it as needed to the printer engine for output.

Similarly other than processing print data the output controller and the combined controller C F may perform functions such as payment processing if service charge applies print job management queuing spooling etc.

Referring to a user receives an email on an information apparatus using an email application. Functions available to the user are displayed at the bottom of the screen . Printing is one of the functions displayed by the print function control or icon . The user may invoke such functions by selecting the icons displayed. The user can make the selection by using for example any one or combination of a keyboard keypad mouse stylus soft keys push buttons software command touch sensitive screen etc. The user may also make such selection by for example a pull down menu voice activated command etc.

As the user selects Print function control the output process described with reference to is invoked. As a result the user is notified of all the printers if any available that can take the print or output job. If no available printers are detected the user may also be notified and provided with alternatives as described with reference to steps and of .

Assume in this example that three printers are found available as the result of discovery process step . In screen informs the user of the make and model of each available printer. The user may obtain further information on each available printer by for example selecting a more information control or arrow sign displayed after the name of each printer. Further information provided here may include without limitation service options offered by each printer quality of services provided service charge if any acceptable payment method and whether the use of such printer is restricted to a certain group.

If a printer is restricted to be used by a certain group the user may be required to provide identification information before being able to select this printer. For example to use a printer placed in the hallway of a company office building a user may have to identify himself or herself as an employee of such company. Password personal identification number or I.D. number of the information apparatus may be required for authorization purposes. The identification information may be provided by the user manually or detected by the output controller or output device automatically. If the printer provides fee based service certain payment process steps may be required additionally which are not shown in the figures for simplicity.

After the user has successfully selected the desired output device or devices in the service negotiation process the information apparatus may communicate with output controller to identify data or software components if any which need to be uploaded to the information apparatus to enable printing. The output manager residing in the information apparatus may participate in coordinate and manage the communications between applications in the information apparatus and the output controller .

In this particular example as illustrated in the communication between the information apparatus and the output controller has identified that a printer driver needs to be uploaded as displayed on screen . Options are provided to the user as whether or not to continue the process. This information and selection are optional as the process may be implemented transparently to the user. Other optional information that the information apparatus may provide to the user includes for example the estimation of time needed for the uploading.

The above description gives an example of a printer driver component that may need to be uploaded. Other components and combinations may also be possible this may include for example a partial print driver data software components or a user interface. A partial print driver or component may for example include only device dependent software components and data specific to an output device. Device independent code and data of the device driver may have been previously installed in the information apparatus and therefore need not be uploaded. It is also possible that no components need to be uploaded because all the components needed for printing to the selected output device may already reside in the information apparatus . Assuming in this example that the user agrees to upload the driver illustrates an example of an interface when synchronization process proceeds.

When the synchronization process is completed screen is displayed to the user as shown in .
