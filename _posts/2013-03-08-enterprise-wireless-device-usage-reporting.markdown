This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 696 637 entitled ENTERPRISE WIRELESS USAGE REPORTING SYSTEM and filed Sep. 4 2012 the entirety of the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.

The present disclosure relates generally to accounting and management of information therefor and more particularly to reporting usage and billing of enterprise wireless communications devices.

Mobile wireless communications devices which refer generally to cellular phones smart phones tablets personal digital assistants wireless hot spot devices and so forth are widely used in contemporary business enterprises to the point of practical ubiquity. Conventional devices are capable of voice and data communications and are thus used to place telephone calls send e mails and text messages via the Short Message Service or SMS browse the web and download media and to perform any other function that involves the transfer of data between the device and a remote system. The capabilities of these devices are almost limitless and find application in facilitating numerous business roles.

These devices have multiple wireless communications modes that serve different purposes. For short range low data throughput device to device communications such as that for wireless headsets Bluetooth is commonly utilized. For high speed local area networking with other computers and or devices and for connecting the device to the Internet WiFi IEEE 802.11x may be utilized. Although WiFi data links have high data throughput range tends to be limited. WiFi networks hotspots are typically found in businesses and homes for linking commonly owned computing resources together and to connect to the Internet. For the most part the networks are individually managed and access may be restricted to authorized devices. Extensive efforts to deploy public WiFi networks in a variety of locations have been made. In commercial establishments such as cafes access may be free but in public places such as airports train stations libraries and the like access may be granted only upon payment. Some service providers have deployed WiFi networks in multiple different locations but each being accessible with a single user account established with the provider.

Although WiFi service is expanding to more locations cellular based communications modalities provides the most extensive voice and data coverage. Generally cellular networks are comprised of a series of sites with short range transceivers to which the mobile devices or handsets are linked over established protocols. These protocols are a part of competing families of standards classified under 3GPP 3rd Generation Partnership Project which relies upon the GSM Global System for Mobile Communications standard as its base and 3GPP2 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 which relies upon cdmaOne as its base. The respective fundamental standards have evolved over time with increasing data transfer speeds and network availability. Competing service providers have adopted one standards platform or another and performance improvements resulting from each enhancement are touted as key differentiators.

In order to accommodate different usage profiles amongst the subscriber base service providers offer a variety of packages at different price points. Although some subscriptions are pre paid for a certain amount of airtime with no commitment periods most subscriptions are two year commitments and billed on a monthly basis for varying baseline usage. For example one package may be offered for a minimal number of minutes with the lowest price while another package may be offered for additional minutes with a higher price. Any usage exceeding the baseline 200 minutes in a month for example may be billed at a higher rate per minute. In addition to voice calls data usage may also be part of the package and tracked billed the same way.

Mobile wireless subscriptions are typically paid for by individual consumers even though some business uses may occur. However an increasing number of companies purchase devices and subscriptions for employees particularly to salespeople and executives who frequently travel but must remain in contact with customers and employees alike. Additionally company issued devices may be necessary for employees who are critical to operations and must always be reachable in case of emergencies.

With this practice becoming the norm wireless subscription costs for businesses are growing exponentially. Presently no solutions exist for reporting on the usage of company owned devices though painstaking manual reviews of individual bills on a systematic basis have yielded cost savings of up to 25 . Companies are oftentimes organized or structured according to business functions with each unit being responsible for its own budget and costs including mobile subscriptions. Appropriate chargebacks allocating the costs to the incurring unit would be desirable but again there are no solutions therefor. This process is further complicated when there are multiple wireless service providers. Accordingly there is a need in the art for an improved enterprise wireless device usage reporting system and method which can serve as a single consolidation point for managing multiple wireless subscriptions.

An embodiment of the present disclosure is directed to a method for managing communications devices on an application service system. Each of the communications devices may be associated with a user and a subscription account of a wireless service provider. The subscription account may be identified by a wireless number. The method may include receiving charge data on the application service system from a billing system of the wireless provider. The charge data may be for a first one of the communications devices. Thereafter there may be a step of saving the charge data in a wireless device inventory database connected to the application service system. The wireless device inventory database may include one or more device records each of which may be associated with a particular one of the communications devices. The device records may also be defined at least by a wireless number and a charge record. In turn the charge record may include one or more charge identifiers and corresponding charge amounts therefor. The charge data may be stored in the charge record of a one of the device records for the communications device as designated by a device identifier included in the charge data. The method may further include generating a report on the application service system. The report may be generated from the wireless device inventory database based upon at least a portion of an aggregate of data stored in the one of the device records.

Certain other embodiments of the present disclosure contemplate respective computer readable program storage media that each tangibly embodies one or more programs of instructions executable by a data processing device to perform the foregoing method. The present disclosure will be best understood by reference to the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Common reference numerals are used throughout the drawings and the detailed description to indicate the same elements.

The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of the presently preferred embodiment of the managing communications devices and is not intended to represent the only form in which the present method may be developed or utilized. The description sets forth the functions and the sequence of steps for developing and operating the invention in connection with the illustrated embodiment. It is to be understood however that the same or equivalent functions and sequences may be accomplished by different embodiments that are also intended to be encompassed within the spirit and scope of the invention. It is further understood that the use of relational terms such as first second and the like are used solely to distinguish one from another entity without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order between such entities.

With reference to the block diagram of one embodiment of the present disclosure contemplates a single consolidation point for an enterprise to manage multiple wireless subscriptions. In further detail the enterprise may have multiple employees also referred to as users . As more particularly illustrated in the block diagram of the employees may be separated into one or more divisions on the basis of job function or other organizational partition. For example there may be a first division comprised of salespersons including a first user and a second user . Furthermore a second division may be comprised of operations personnel including a third user a fourth user and a fifth user . Finally a third division may be management comprised of a sixth user

Each of the users have respective communications devices . As referenced herein communications device is understood to be any wireless mobile device such as a cellular phone smart phone tablet laptop with cellular network connectivity and so forth. It is not intended to be limited to any particular type of communications form factor or any other characteristic. In the context of the present disclosure which is generally directed to the management of mobile device subscriptions the communications device is understood to be any device that relies upon a wireless service provider for data communications. Along these lines as utilized herein the term subscription refers broadly to an ongoing relationship between the user and a service provider and does not necessarily require for there to be a formal contractual arrangement with duration commitments. Although preferred embodiments of the present disclosure can be used for managing such contractual arrangements other alternative wireless service arrangements such as prepaid accounts and pay as you go type accounts may also be handled. In this regard the term subscription refers to any such arrangement.

According to one exemplary embodiment the budgets of each division are separate and independent of the others with separate account payables and receivables. Thus expenses such as mobile device subscriptions may be separately handled amongst the various divisions . In addition to the foregoing divisions secondary divisions such as one drawn along specific markets or industries where the enterprise deals with multiple markets or industries with personnel being assigned to one or more such secondary divisions are also possible within the enterprise. Those having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the foregoing divisions are presented by way of example only and not of limitation. While the present disclosure considers various features in relation to only one set of divisions it is to be understood that those features are adaptable to such additional divisions within the enterprise .

Referring again to the block diagram of according to one embodiment an application service system is understood to be the aforementioned single consolidation point. The application service system may be a conventional server computer system that executes pre programmed instructions of a software application embodying a method for managing the communications devices . It is understood that like any other conventional computer the server computer system has a processor data storage and a network link to communicate with for example an administrative client computer system . An administrative user who is someone within the enterprise responsible for managing the communications devices can use the client computer system to access the functionality implemented on the application service system to perform appurtenant tasks.

In this regard the software application is implemented as a remote service SaaS or Software as a Service with a consistent user interface that does not depend on the specifics of the client computer system . In one implementation the software application is web based that is the application service system further includes a web server and various interface pages populated with stored data are transmitted to the client computer system in response to requests generated thereby. The function of generating the interface pages and the flow of user interaction is governed by the execution of the application while the low level mechanics of transmitting the content in a predetermined format for proper rendering on the client computer system is implemented by the web server.

On the side of the client computer system there is understood to be a web browser application running thereon that can generate appropriately formatted requests to the web server on the application service system and receive and render the content transmitted by the web server. Thus the client computer system is similarly understood to be a conventional computing device with a processor data storage and network connectivity. The operation of web servers and web browsers is well known in the art so no further consideration as to the details will be discussed herein. A familiar interface with readily recognizable interactive elements is understood to make routine tasks involved with the management of communications devices easier for the administrative user who may not necessarily have extensive expertise. Furthermore the centralized nature of the application service system permits other administrative users from possibly other divisions of the enterprise to access the same.

As indicated above wireless connectivity for the communications devices rely upon dispersed cellular network sites that are operated by various wireless service providers . In the illustrated example of there are two a first wireless service provider and a second wireless service provider that are competitors to each other. Completely independent of the divisions within the enterprise by way of example the first second and third communications devices and respectively are associated with the first wireless service provider while the fourth fifth and sixth communications devices respectively are associated with the second wireless service provider

Systems for accurately tracking and billing for usage of the communications devices are known in the art and may be comprised of several discrete yet interconnected systems. Conventionally end user presentation of bills and acceptance of payments therefor are handled by a billing system which may similarly be a web based application. Aside from retrieving raw usage data the billing system may have little connection to the tracking systems that are part of the cellular network infrastructure. For connectivity purposes each communications device that is part of the network is identified by a permanent unique code known as an IMEI International Mobile Station Equipment Identifier . For billing purposes however it may be more convenient to identify account holders or users based upon its telephone number.

Each of the users have an account on the billing system . The first billing system for the first wireless service provider includes a first subscription account associated with the first communications device and the first user a second subscription account associated with the second communications device and the second user and a third subscription account associated with the third communications device and the third user . Likewise the second billing system for the second wireless service provider includes a first subscription account associated with the fourth communications device and the fourth user a second subscription account associated with the fifth communications device and the fifth user and a third subscription account associated with the sixth communications device and the sixth user . Each of the foregoing subscription accounts are understood to be uniquely identified by the respective telephone numbers. Furthermore one account may have associated therewith more than one communications device . Again the various subscription accounts mentioned above are presented by way of example only and not of limitation.

The present disclosure contemplates aggregating usage data otherwise provided by the billing systems to the users and storing the same in a master database of accounts. From this database it is possible for the application service system to generate meaningful and actionable reports to the users as well as those supervisory personnel managing different divisions within the enterprise and finance teams. The improved visibility is envisioned to reduce costs and provide a more streamlined process for chargebacks where the subscription costs are allocated to specific divisions . As utilized herein the term chargeback is understood to refer to such cost allocations to different divisions of the enterprise . Additionally however the term is also intended to encompass showbacks where costs are presented to the divisions for more transparency without necessarily charging the costs to that division for budgetary management purposes.

The block diagram of further illustrates the configuration of the application service system and more particularly the aforementioned database. In one embodiment there is a wireless device inventory database that is connected to or otherwise associated with the application service system . As suggested by its nomenclature the wireless device inventory database includes one or more device records each of which are associated with a respective one of the communications devices that are being managed within the enterprise . Although only two of the device records are shown the wireless device inventory database is understood to include device records for all of the communications devices .

At a minimum the device records are defined by a wireless number a wireless service provider identifier a subscription account identifier and a charge record . The wireless service provider identifier and the subscription account identifier referred to in the aggregate as the service provider account information are useful in organizing a plurality of communications devices that are under a single wireless subscription account . The charge record includes one or more charge identifiers and corresponding charge amounts . In particular the example charge record has a first charge identifier with a first charge amount and a second charge identifier with a second charge amount . To the extent there are communications devices of multiple wireless carriers being managed an additional provider identifier may be included. Additional exemplar details of the types of information for the charge identifier will be discussed below when considering the usage data that is produced by and retrieved from the billing system .

The embodiment of the application service system shown in further includes a personnel database that stores user account records . Again although only two particular user account records are shown the personnel database is understood to include user records for all of the users with communications devices that are being managed within the enterprise by the application service system . Each of the accounts includes the wireless number s and or the corresponding service provider account information of all communications devices thereunder as well as a first name a last name and an e mail address . Generally the wireless number is understood to encompass any unique identifier that designates or otherwise identifies the communications device and or the accounts . Additional information about the users may be collected and stored in the user account records and the foregoing details are intended to be exemplary only.

In addition to the wireless device inventory database and the personnel database there is an enterprise division database comprised of one or more division definition records . By way of example the division definition records are understood to define which of the communications devices are part of which one of the divisions . To this end the division definition records include a listing of the telephone numbers that are to be part of that division . For instance suppose the first division definition record corresponds to the first division . Since the first communications device the second communications device and the third communications device are each part of the first division the first division definition record contains a listing of corresponding wireless numbers for those devices. Utilizing multiple division definition records e.g. the second division definition record multiple divisions may be defined. To uniquely identify each of the division definition records there may be a chargeback identifier that may be a simple code that identifies the division .

The common data element across the wireless device inventory database the personnel database and the enterprise division database is the wireless number which can serve as the index by which all other data stored in the application service system can be accessed. In the alternative the service provider account information may be utilized for this purpose. Additionally when the databases are so configured cross referencing fields may be included in the various records to link to related data in other databases. For example the device record may also include a charge unit reference which is associated with the chargeback identifier of the division definition record . The charge unit reference can denote the division s of which that communications device is a member. Those having ordinary skill in the art will recognize the several possible ways by which referential integrity may be maintained across the databases. Notwithstanding the foregoing all of the above mentioned information can be stored and organized in a single database in a flat record type of arrangement and the basic functions of the method for managing the communications devices can be achieved with such minimal complexity. The presented configuration is exemplary only and not intended to be limiting.

In one embodiment the application service system is deployed as a web based service that can be accessed by multiple users simultaneously. It is expressly contemplated that the service is scalable beyond just the single enterprise and can have different restricted access accounts where solely the data of the enterprise for which the account is set up is visible to the personnel affiliated therewith. Along these lines the visual appearance of the various user interfaces discussed below may be customized with enterprise specific logos color schemes and other look and feel elements. Depending on the feature needs of the enterprise differing payment plans for accessing the service may be implemented. With reference to the initial setup for such enterprise accounts is a guided wizard that presents various screens with input forms that are sequentially completed by the administrative user .

Generally the wizard is segregated into two major steps as indicated by a first step indicator icon and a second step indicator icon both of which are generated on a first setup screen . Information that is typically for setting up online accounts is requested such as a first name in a text input field a last name in a text input field an e mail address in a text input field an account password and confirmation in text input fields a telephone number in a text input field and a business name in a text input field . Passwords are understood to have varying strength levels depending on the characters and sequences therein and an indicator can also be presented to encourage the administrative user to select a robust one. Setting up an online account requires the user to accept certain terms that cover acceptable and unacceptable uses privacy issues and so forth and in acknowledgement of these terms a checkbox is activated before continuing to the next step in the process. The data entered in the text input fields can be discarded and the account setup process voided by activating a cancel button . Otherwise a continue button can be activated to proceed to the next step.

With reference to a second setup screen shown in additional details pertaining to a first one of the communications devices and the corresponding subscription account is requested. The presently contemplated embodiments are configured for usage data from one of several carriers the company logos with activatable links selections of which are displayed in the second setup screen . A user designated descriptor for the subscription account may be input in a text input field . If the administrative user currently has raw usage data downloaded from the billing system then a file containing the same stored on the local file system i.e. the hard drive of the client computer system can be specified in a file designation field . Once the file is designated an upload button can be selected to begin the process of transferring the specified file to the application service system . Upon the designated file being received by the application service system it is compared against the master database to ensure that all of the information needed for reporting in accordance with the various embodiments is present.

Because the identity of the carrier can be ascertained from such a file there is understood to be no need to designate the carrier via the activatable links . Accordingly the selection may be limited to one or the other of the activatable links or a radio button the selection of which renders active the file designation field . Once the selection is made the continue button can be activated to proceed to the next step. Alternatively to return to the first setup screen a back button can be activated.

As briefly indicated above various embodiments of the present disclosure include the functionality of assigning mobile device subscription costs to a specific division within the enterprise . The designation of the division is made via the aforementioned chargeback identifier and or the charge unit reference . The values therefor can be entered in a first chargeback input field generated on a third setup screen . Continuing with the earlier introduced example shown in either the first division sales the second division operations or the third division management can be specified in the first chargeback input field . Also as mentioned above an alternative grouping of users apart from these may be simultaneously defined. These alternative divisions may be specified in a second chargeback input field .

With additional reference to the data input in the chargeback input fields are understood to be references or identifiers to chargeback records that include additional details that further define those records. There may be one or more chargeback records that include such information as a descriptor owner name owner e mail and an activation status . If the chargeback record already exists merely referencing the chargeback identifier in the chargeback input fields is operative to designate the user account for the first one of the communications devices to that division .

If no such records exist an overlaid form for inputting such data may be generated on the third setup screen as shown in upon selecting an add button . Existing chargeback records are shown in table form with the chargeback identifier listed in a first column the descriptor listed in a second column the owner name listed in a third column the owner e mail listed in a fourth column and the activation status listed in a fifth column . In further detail the activation status is represented as a checked or unchecked checkbox which designated whether the chargeback identifier can be used or not. At the top of each of the columns are new entry input fields where new chargeback records can be defined. Upon entering the data into the new entry input fields an add button can be selected to commit the additions to the enterprise division database or other suitable data store. Thereafter the new chargeback record can be displayed in the table. It is possible to delete or edit existing data through a delete button or an edit button respectively. When the edit button is selected the new entry input fields are populated with that record and is therefore editable.

Once any needed operations are performed it is possible to return to the third setup screen by selecting a done button which commits any unsaved changes or a cancel button which discards any unsaved changes. Upon returning to the third setup screen the designations of the chargeback identifiers may be saved and the wizard can proceed to the next step by activating the continue button . The wizard can return to the second setup screen by activating the back button .

The wizard then continues to a fifth setup screen as shown in . When raw usage data from the billing system is uploaded while the wizard is in the second setup screen the wizard skips to the fifth setup screen . Here additional details and preferences for trending and chargeback are provided. A first checkbox designates whether chargeback reporting is utilized or not and a target spending may be activated with a second checkbox . The actual amount of the target may be specified in a text input field . Furthermore preferences for the reporting functionality including showing the enterprise average is activated with a third checkbox and showing the top users in terms of usage is activated with a fourth checkbox . A variable number of top users to report may be specified in a pull down menu . According to some embodiments it is possible to send chargeback reports to administrative users . Because there may be multiple administrative users for example one per division and it would be beneficial to send messages to relevant users only the recipient may be set on a per subscription account basis. The name of the administrative user is specified in a first text input field and that user s e mail address is specified in a second text input field . Multiple administrative users may be assigned to a single subscription account and additional ones may be specified by selecting an add button . The wizard completes the setup process upon activating a complete button and returns to the fourth setup screen by activating the back button .

It is to be understood that the foregoing sequence appearance and contents of the wizard is presented by way of example only and not of limitation. Any other suitable interface that solicits more or less data while still achieving the same functionality discussed herein may be readily substituted without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.

Various embodiments of the present disclosure also contemplate a method for managing communications devices on the application service system . With reference to the flowchart of the method may begin with a step of receiving charge data from the billing system for a first one of the communications devices. As utilized herein the term charge data is understood to refer to any data provided by the billing system that pertains to billing for the communications device . This includes fees assessed by the wireless service provider for different usage tiers supplemental fees assessed for additional usage beyond subscription limits of usage tiers as well as usage metrics such as bytes kilobytes megabytes of data talk or airtime and so forth. As will be described more fully below this charge data is parsed to various charge records stored in the wireless device inventory database .

In some cases the billing system provides an application programming interface API that allows direct access for automated systems such as the application service system for the charge data. More particularly the application service system is understood to interact with the billing system over the API to receive the charge data for direct transfer into respective charge identifiers and charge amounts of the device records for the communications device to which the charge data pertains. However even when an API to directly access the charge data on the billing system is not provided it may be possible to automate the steps of obtaining data and routing the same to the appropriate records on the databases with preprogrammed scripts and the like.

Where such automation is contemplated the method may include an optional precursor step of generating a query to the billing system . The query is understood to be for the first communications device and optionally the query may be based upon the wireless number . The query may also be based on the service provider account information . Any other suitable query to identify the particular subscription account such as account number IMEI number or another identifier may be substituted without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. When there are multiple subscription accounts in one billing system all of the charge data pertaining to the enterprise may be retrieved at once. In such case the query may be based upon an enterprise account identifier. The charge data received in the step is understood to be responsive to this query. In order to so interact directly with the billing system there may be an additional step of initiating a data communications link from the application service system to the billing system followed by a step of logging in to the billing system with administrator credentials that are associated with the enterprise . To the extent there are additional billing systems the foregoing steps and may be repeated.

If automation of retrieving the charge data is not possible or practical an alternative is manual downloading. In such case the administrative user manually logs in to the billing system and directs the same to generate and transmit the charge data. This task may be repeated for each of the billing systems for the wireless service providers that is utilized by the enterprise . The resultant file that is downloaded to the client computer system may be in a raw format that lacks direct correspondence to the respective charge identifiers and charge amounts of the communications device to which the charge data pertains. One exemplary interface for uploading such data files is shown in . There is a first pull down menu that defines the wireless service provider from which the data was downloaded along with a second pull down menu that defines the account number. The data file is specified in a file designation field and upon selecting an upload button it is transmitted to the application service system . To accommodate alternatively formatted structured data the method may include an optional step of parsing the received charge data in the raw format to mapped fields and values corresponding to the respective charge identifiers and charge amounts . Different billing systems may format the charge data differently and provide fewer or greater level of detail. One wireless carrier provides extensive data per the following fields 

The method then continues with a step of saving the charge data to the wireless device inventory database . More particularly the charge data is stored in the charge record of a one of the one or more device records for the communications device as designated by a device identifier included in the charge data. The device identifier may be the wireless number in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure or any other suitable data. Via the device record and more particularly charge unit reference thereof the appropriate division to which the costs are allocated is defined.

In accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure the method also contemplates a step of generating a report from the wireless device inventory database . Furthermore the report may be based upon at least a portion of an aggregate of data stored in the device records and provides accurate usage data directly to administrative users and regular users alike on how much is being spent on wireless services. As best shown in one example implementation of such report is a dashboard . Generally the dashboard shows trends of wireless charges user accounts last bill amounts total number of devices spend by wireless service provider device breakouts top users and analytics to identify optimization of accounts that would flag the communications devices not used in the last 30 60 and 90 days.

The dashboard is divided into multiple segments. There is a numerical summary section with a total charges gauge showing the total amount charged across all subscription accounts in the enterprise for a given month as indicated. For comparison purposes the total amount charged in a previous month is also shown as is a trend sign that shows either a downward or upward arrow to correspond to the decreasing or increasing cost trends. The numerical summary section also includes an employee average charge gauge for the indicated month the average charged in a previous month and a trend sign . Finally there is a device number gauge that indicates the total number of communications devices being managed by the application service system the number in a previous month and a trend sign

Referring now to the dashboard includes an account management section that includes a listing of all subscription accounts being managed by the application service system . As shown the listing includes multiple columns with different data therein including account identifiers total charges the number of devices under the account and so forth. New subscription accounts may be added by selecting an add new account button . This may invoke the same wizard discussed above in relation to adding accounts having already discussed those details they will be omitted here. There is a manage device button that when selected invokes a device management interface .

As shown in the device management interface includes a listing of all communications devices that are being handled by the application service system . The device management interface includes a checkbox for showing and hiding unused devices. When checked as shown in the active communications devices are hidden and only those that are unused is shown in a listing . Unused as referenced herein may be identified by searching for charge records without usage metrics that do not exceed a predetermined threshold.

Returning to the dashboard shown in the account management section further includes a report button . According to various embodiments of the present disclosure the method also contemplates the generating of tailored reports to various users and administrative users . One type of report that can be generated is specific to one user or account holder and generates usage data of each of the communications devices under a single account. Another type of report that can be generated is a division report for all communications devices that are part of a single division . Such a report may be derived from the aggregate of data stored in the one or more device records with common chargeback identifier values that are associated with the specific division . Furthermore a finance report for all communications devices managed by the enterprise may also be generated. This report is an aggregate of all data stored in the device records . These reports are understood to provide a greater level of transparency to all levels of personnel for targeting excessive wireless usage and costs.

As shown in the the dashboard also includes a visualization section that includes a series of graphs that assist with quick comparisons of aggregated charge data. A first bar graph plots both the total charges and the number of devices on a month to month basis. The magnitude of any reductions or increases can be readily ascertained therefrom. A first pie chart shows the relative percentage of one wireless service provider or another while a second pie chart shows spending per device type. Further a second bar graph plots the relative spending amongst different divisions of the enterprise .

Other visualizations include a top users section as shown in that is an ordered listing of all users arranged according to charged amounts. One example use for this visualization is to identify those users that have higher than normal usages and or to switch them to more cost efficient subscription plans. There is also an unused devices section shown in which is similar in function and content as the device management interface shown in . Again it is understood to be useful for identifying potential communications devices for cancellation since it appears unused.

The particulars shown herein are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of the embodiments of the present invention only and are presented in the cause of providing what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of the principles and conceptual aspects of mobile device usage reporting and management. In this regard no attempt is made to show more details than is necessary for a fundamental understanding of the disclosure the description taken with the drawings making apparent to those skilled in the art how the several forms of the presently disclosed methods may be embodied in practice.
