This application is a non provisional of and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 705 475 filed Sep. 25 2012 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 608 064 filed Mar. 7 2012 both of which are incorporated herein by this reference.

New and emerging memory technologies for example resistive change or resistivity change memory cells are gaining in popularity. Some examples include phase change PCRAM and conductive bridge CB RRAM memories all of which have limited endurance. For resistive change memories generally the cumulative number of set or reset cycles the component memory cells may undergo before failure is finite and may be difficult to predict. Consequently in typical applications the host or memory storage controller must either estimate or acquire a present endurance state of the constituent cells and actively manage and track their usage striving to minimize the variance in usage of physical locations.

While erase count based estimates of durability or endurance may be adequate for NAND Flash wear leveling this technique does not scale well for technologies like CB RRAM or PCRAM as the total amount of persistent storage required to maintain these counts increases with the smaller granularity of program erase operations.

Reference will now be made in detail to various embodiments examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the disclosed embodiments. However embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known methods procedures components and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the embodiments.

A resistive change memory device generally includes an array of resistive change memory cells each of which includes a resistive memory element. The resistive memory element includes a resistance switching material situated between two electrodes. The resistance switching material has at least two states a high resistance state and a low resistance state and can be cycled between these two states by application of appropriate voltages to the electrodes thus allowing the resistive memory element to be programmed. For example a resistive change memory cell for which the resistance switching material has been programmed to the high resistance state referred to herein as a reset state is considered to store a 1 and a resistive change memory cell for which the resistance switching material has been programmed to the low resistance state referred to herein as a set state is considered to store a 0 or vice versa.

Four general classes of resistance switching materials are solid electrolyte materials insulating materials phase change materials and organic materials. The term resistive change memory device as used herein includes without limitation memories that use any of these classes of resistance switching materials e.g. resistance switching random access memories RRAMs conductive bridging random access memories CB RAMS and phase change memories PRAMs . Examples of resistance switching electrolyte materials include GeSe GeS CuS CuO AgS WO CeO HfO and SiO. Examples of resistance switching insulating materials include TiO NiO SrZrO SrTiO ZrO and MgO.

A resistive change memory cell using a solid electrolyte material as the resistance switching material is typically fabricated using a metal that exhibits ionic conductivity in the solid electrolyte i.e. a metal ion source for the solid electrolyte as the first electrode and an inert metal as the second electrode. Application of a biasing condition e.g. a first bias voltage applied for a specified duration that corresponds to a set operation causes the first electrode to inject ions into the solid electrolyte the ions precipitate into filaments that produce low resistance paths between the electrodes resulting in formation of a low resistance state or set state in the solid electrolyte.

Application of a biasing condition e.g. a second bias voltage distinct from the first bias voltage applied for a specified duration that corresponds to a reset operation causes the dissolution of the filaments resulting in formation of a high resistance state or reset state in the solid electrolyte. While other types of resistance switching materials may operate in accordance with other physical mechanisms the materials also may be programmed to low resistance set and high resistance reset states . The reset operation however does not entirely reverse the set operation some ions injected into the solid electrolyte during the set operation remain in the solid electrolyte after the reset operation. Over time these ions accumulate in the solid electrolyte as the resistive change memory cell is repeatedly cycled between set and reset states resulting in a decrease in the resistive change memory cell s reset resistance i.e. the resistance in the reset state . Similarly ions may also accumulate in the form of reduced metal at the inert electrode leading to a reduction in the effective thickness of the electrolyte and reducing the resistive change memory cell s resistance in the high resistance state. Eventually the reset resistance and the set resistance of the resistive change memory cell change to a point at which the reset resistance and the set resistance cannot be distinguished rapidly and reliably. When this occurs the resistive change memory cell can be regarded as no longer being functional.

A newly fabricated resistive change memory cell has an initial write endurance. The write endurance is the maximum number of set reset cycles the memory cell will undergo before the above described degradation mechanisms make the reset resistance and the set resistance of the resistive change memory cell difficult to distinguish rapidly and reliably. Each set reset cycle that the memory cell undergoes degrades the difference between the reset resistance and the set resistance. Thus at any point in its lifetime a resistive change memory cell can be regarded as having what may be called a future endurance or remaining endurance. The remaining endurance of a resistive memory cell corresponds to the number of set reset cycles the memory cell will be able to undergo before the memory cell ceases to be functional.

At a first point Ihas sufficient margin with respect to I to allow a 1 stored in the resistive change memory cell to be read rapidly and reliably. At a second point however the reset resistance has decreased by an amount such that Ino longer has sufficient margin with respect to I to allow a 1 stored in the resistive change memory cell to be read rapidly and reliably. The number of cycles N corresponding to the second point represents the write endurance of the resistive change memory cell the resistive change memory cell is deemed to have failed when the number of set reset cycles exceeds N. Note that although I is illustrated as being a linear function of the number N of set reset cycles in general I and hence the resistive change memory cell s resistance is a monotonic function and in some implementations a non linear monotonic function of the number N of set reset cycles.

Resistive change memory cells with endurance such as that illustrated in include at least three terminal resistive change memory cells and two terminal resistive change memory cells. are schematic diagrams of respective three terminal resistive change memory cells . In resistive change memory cells and a pass gate e.g. a transistor and a resistive memory element are arranged in series between a node or terminal and a node or terminal . Node may connect to a bit line and node may connect to a source line. The gate of pass gate connects to a node or terminal that connects to a word line. The order of pass gate and resistive memory element is reversed in resistive change memory cell as compared to resistive change memory cell .

To program resistive change memory cells and a logic high H signal is applied to the gate of pass gate via node to turn on pass gate and a programming voltage is applied between nodes and for a specified duration. In some embodiments a positive set voltage Vis applied between nodes and e.g. Vis a positive voltage relative to node for a first duration to perform a set operation and a negative reset voltage Vis applied between nodes and e.g. Vis a negative voltage relative to node for a second duration to perform a reset operation. Note that the first duration and the second duration are typically equal. Also note that this specification refers to a logic high H signal being applied to a gate to turn on pass gate . However a voltage other than the logic high H signal and that is sufficient to turn on the pass gate may be applied to the pass gate. Similarly this specification refers to a logic low L signal being applied to pass gate to turn off the pass gate. However a voltage other than the logic low L signal and that is sufficient to turn off the pass gate may be applied to the pass gate.

In some embodiments to perform a restore operation for the resistive change memory cells and the logic high signal is applied to the gate of pass gate via node to turn on the pass gate and a negative restore voltage Vis applied between the nodes and e.g. Vis a negative voltage relative to node for a third duration. In some implementations voltage Vis greater in magnitude than voltage V. In some implementations voltage Vis applied between nodes and for a longer duration in the restore operation than the voltage Vis applied between nodes and in the reset operation. In other words the third duration is greater than the second duration. Alternatively the restore operation is performed by applying V as opposed to V between nodes and for a longer duration than for the reset operation.

The two terminal resistive change memory cells and are programmed and restored in similar manners to the three terminal resistive change memory cells and except that there is no pass gate to turn on and the programming and restore voltages are adjusted to account for threshold voltage V. For example instead of applying V V or V respectively V V V V or V V are applied between nodes and .

Resistive change memory cells such as resistive change memory cells or are situated in an array in a resistive change memory device. illustrates an array of resistive change memory cells including resistive change memory cells and in accordance with some embodiments. While the array is made up of resistive change memory cells it alternatively could be made up of resistive change memory cells . Word lines WL WL and WL extend across respective rows of resistive change memory cells in the array each of the word lines WL WL and WL is coupled to the gates of the pass gates of the resistive change memory cells in a respective row. Bit lines BLA BLOB BLA BLB BLA and BLB extend across respective columns of resistive change memory cells in the array each of the bit lines BLA BLOB BLA BLB BLA and BLB couples to the sources of the pass gates of the resistive change memory cells in a respective column. The number of rows and columns shown for array is limited for visual clarity the array may include additional rows and columns. The source of each respective pass gate corresponds to a node . In some implementations each bit line is coupled to a respective read write RD WR circuit and to a pull down transistor e.g. an n type MOSFET .

Referring now to it shows a simplified conceptual diagram illustrating a conventional memory array organization in a memory device. Each bank consists of R number of rows each of which is composed of C number of columns. The width of a column access is G bytes. The banks are replicated B number of times within a device. The total memory size in bytes is the product of B R C G.

In some embodiments the data array organization may be modified to support arbitrary block remapping. shows the changes for one bank for simplicity as these changes apply to the other banks in the same way. One significant change in an RRAM device is the support for more physical blocks than the number of logical blocks. This over provisioning applies in the number of extra columns denoted as C and in the number of extra rows denoted as R . The size of the over provision can be as small as one.

The new organization would have C number of columns in each row and a column translation table denoted as CTT that maps the logical columns to their physical columns. Similarly each bank has R number of rows and a row translation table denoted as RTT that maps the logical rows to their physical rows. It is possible to have a global translation table that maps any logical column on any logical row to any physical column to any physical row. However this mapping flexibility has a cost in terms of the translation table size. A preferred embodiment may implement two level translation tables where one table is used to remap all the rows and a series of smaller tables are used to remap all the columns within each row. The prior case describes among other things wear leveling procedures to extend the lifetime of the entire memory device despite having pathological access patterns in short duration . . . We believe that a direct relative measurement of two pages or other regions of memory also would be useful for wear leveling and other purposes.

Similarly the current Iflowing in the bit lines BL ALT in the same state gives an indication of the remaining endurance of the cells in the alternate row. These two currents are input to a comparison circuit ICMP with Icoupled to the non inverting input and Ipresented at the inverting input using analogy to voltage inputs to an op amp .

The comparison circuit generates a binary output signal SWAP indicating a result of the direct comparison of the input currents. This result indicates which of the two rows of cells has a comparatively greater remaining endurance. The result may be used for identifying one of the groups of memory cells as a target for a write operation namely the group or row having the comparatively greater remaining endurance. The result may also be used for selecting one of the groups of memory cells for a subsequent wear leveling action. In addition or in the alternative the result may be used to relocate data during a refresh operation.

In some embodiments measurement of the target row current Iand measurement of the alternate row current Imay be done concurrently. In other embodiments the row currents may be measured sequentially. At least one cell current of each row of interest should be measured although not all cells of the row need be measured. Current measurements are not limited to bit line currents they may include any or all of bit line currents word line currents global bit line currents or source line currents in each of the first and second groups of memory cells as further described below.

In the comparator a first current mirror and a second current mirror present the target and alternate bit line currents respectively to a node via a third mirror where a difference between the two currents is input to an amplifier inverter . In this example if the alternate current is less than the target current indicating greater remaining endurance of the alternate row node is pulled down and the SWAP signal is asserted active high .

The test node of Bank and the test node of Bank are input to a current comparison circuit which may be similar to that described above with regard to . The comparison circuit outputs the SWAP signal as shown. During test operations the sense amps SA of both banks are off or tri stated. In an embodiment an optional mux may be provided to couple node to a fixed reference current source IREF. In this way the selected Bank row test current I Row can be compared to the reference current IREF to provide an indication of remaining endurance of the row. The SWAP result signal can be used in various ways as noted above.

The currents through the selected WL cells labeled I I together form the total target word line current I . Likewise the alternate WL cell currents labeled I I sum to form the total alternate word line current I. The target and alternate word line currents are steered via switch logic for example to a current comparison circuit I CMP. The circuit I CMP compares the two currents and generates a SWAP signal. Thus the SWAP signal provides an indication based on direct word line current comparison of which row the target row or the alternate has a relatively greater remaining endurance.

During a test operation in one embodiment switch logic provided per row for example logic may be arranged to steer the target row source line current Ifrom the corresponding cells to a common node while isolating the non selected rows. Similarly the switch logic steers the alternate row source line current Ifrom the corresponding SL cells to a common node . The target row source line current node and the alternate row source line current node are input to a current comparison circuit I CMP for comparison. The comparison circuit I CMP generates a result signal SWAP as discussed above and further explained below.

The controller may include a request interface for interfacing with a host or client user of the memory system. The request interface is coupled to an address mapping component which in turn is coupled to request queue and scheduling components details of which are known. The request queue and scheduling components are coupled to a memory interface for interaction with the memory via the interface .

Test mode control logic may be implemented using hardware firmware or any combination of circuits and or software. The test mode control logic may communicate a test request or instructions to the memory via the memory interface for assessing the relative remaining endurance of selected groups of cells in the memory array . The control logic may request memory cell testing at various times including for example upon initialization during idle periods periodically or based on other inputs or factors such as memory access counts. The logic may read test results from the results registers . The test mode control logic may then utilize the results in connection with address mapping for example to remap a write request to an alternate address having relatively greater remaining endurance.

In some embodiments the controller may implement one or more free memory list translation tables . The test mode logic may update the translation tables based on test results from the result registers in the memory. In one example the free memory list may be an ordered list and the test mode logic may update the order responsive to the test results. For example the list may be arranged so that memory cells having relatively greater remaining endurance are used written to before those cells having relatively lesser remaining endurance. The control logic may request a series of tests for example over a range of rows or multiple banks of the memory . The results may be used to form or update an ordered list of groups of memory cells. The endurance testing may be transparent to the host.

In this example the on board controller includes address translation logic and a remaining endurance comparison control circuit or test control logic for brevity. The term logic is used broadly herein and may refer to any combination of circuits and or software used to provide the indicated function. The test control logic is arranged to conduct direct relative endurance testing of selected groups of cells in the memory array . Toward that end the test control logic may interact with the memory to conduct such tests by for example selecting a target address selecting an alternate address isolating sense amps and asserting test control signals so as the generate test results which may be reflected for example in a SWAP result signal as discussed above. The test results may be used to update the address translation logic .

The on board controller using the test control logic may implement some of the same functions as those of the discrete controller of . Thus the on board controller may maintain and update ordered lists of free memory for example responsive to the direct relative endurance testing results garnered by the test control logic . Again these operations may be transparent to the host. Similar to the discrete controller the on board controller may execute testing operations at various times including for example upon initialization during idle periods periodically or based on other inputs or factors such as memory access counts.

In some embodiments the process may continue to testing additional memory cells by updating the current alternate pointer block and repeating the foregoing steps path . Further multiple passes through this type of process can be conducted to effect a bubble sort resulting in an ordered list of groups of memory cells according to remaining endurance test results.

If the sort is not complete at block the next group of cells of the set is selected and the process loops via path back to block to execute a comparison relative to the selected next group of cells. This loop via may be repeated until the end of the set of groups of cells and then further repeated wrapping around back to the beginning of the set making such multiple passes as necessary to complete a bubble sort and thus generate a ranked list of available groups of memory cells. Various methods of this general type may be conducted by a discrete memory controller or an on board controller.

In the case that the measurement result indicates the alternate group of cells has a relatively better remaining endurance than the target group decision the write request is redirected that is the write is directed to the alternate group of cells block rather than to the target group identified in the write request at . In that case the translation tables are updated to reflect the change in the target address for the write request block . A host controller also may be notified of the change. Further a list of alternate groups of cells is updated block to indicate the location where the present write request is redirected as unavailable. Finally a write command is issued to the memory block in accordance with the redirection of block . Referring once again to decision in the case that the measurement result indicates the alternate group of cells does not have a relatively better remaining endurance than the target group the write command is issued see path without redirection.

With regard to decision block in the case that the measurement result indicates the alternate group of cells has a relatively better remaining endurance than the target group of cells the method proceeds to write the data that was stored in a buffer block to the alternate group of cells block . Translation tables are updated accordingly block . And a list of alternate groups of cells likewise is updated block to reflect the selected alternate group see is now in use. Finally the method continues to the next target group in the refresh operation block . Referring once again to decision in the case that the measurement result indicates the alternate group of cells does not have a relatively better remaining endurance than the target group path then the buffered data is written back to the target group of cells from which it came block . The process continues block as noted to process the next target group in the refresh operation.

In some embodiments a method of operating a resistive change memory device includes operating the device in a first mode of operation and a second mode of operation distinct from the first mode. In the first mode a read command is received from a memory controller. In response to the read command a parameter associated with a resistive change memory cell of the resistive change memory device is compared to a first threshold to determine a value of a bit stored in the resistive change memory cell. In the second mode of operation a characterization command is received from the memory controller. In response to the characterization command the parameter associated with the resistive change memory cell is compared to a second threshold to produce a result signal that provides an indication of future endurance of the resistive change memory cell. The second threshold is stricter than the first threshold. Based on the comparing the result signal is transmitted to the memory controller.

In some embodiments a method of controlling a resistive change memory device is performed at a memory controller coupled to the resistive change memory device. In the method a first instruction is transmitted to the resistive change memory device to perform a read operation for a first set of resistive change memory cells in the resistive change memory device in accordance with a first threshold. In response to the first instruction data stored in the first set of resistive change memory cells is received. A second instruction is transmitted to the resistive change memory device to characterize a second set of resistive change memory cells in the resistive change memory device in accordance with a second threshold. The second threshold is stricter than the first threshold. In response to the second instruction a result signal providing an indication of future endurance of the second set of resistive change memory cells is received.

In some embodiments a resistive change memory device includes a resistive change memory cell to store a bit a bit line coupled to the resistive change memory cell and a sense amplifier coupled to the bit line. The sense amplifier is configurable in a first mode to determine a value of the bit stored in the resistive change memory cell in accordance with a first threshold and in a second mode to characterize future endurance of the resistive change memory cell in accordance with a second threshold. The second threshold is stricter than the first threshold.

In some embodiments a resistive change memory device is provided that includes a resistive change memory cell. The resistive change memory cell includes a resistive memory element. A first biasing condition is applied to the resistive change memory cell to program the resistive change memory cell to a reset state. A determination is made that the resistance of the resistive change memory cell in the reset state has decreased below a predefined threshold. In response to the determination a second biasing condition is applied to the resistive change memory cell for a restore operation to counteract the decrease in resistance of the resistive change memory cell in the reset state. At least one of a voltage current and duration of the second biasing condition is greater than a corresponding voltage current or duration of the first biasing condition.

In some embodiments to at least partially reverse the decrease in reset resistance resulting from subjecting the resistive change memory cell to repeated set reset cycles a restore operation is performed under a more extreme biasing condition referred to as a second biasing condition than the biasing condition for the reset operation which is referred to as a first biasing condition. Each biasing condition involves applying a specified voltage to a resistive change memory cell for a specified duration or alternatively applying a specified current to a resistive change memory cell for a specified duration. For example the specified voltage or current of the second biasing condition has a greater magnitude than but the same polarity as the specified voltage or current of the first biasing condition and or the specified duration of the second biasing condition is greater than the specified duration of the first biasing condition. Because the second biasing condition is more extreme than the first biasing condition the restore operation more effectively reverses the set operation than does the reset operation. For example the second biasing condition results in greater migration of ions out of the solid electrolyte onto the electrode than does the first biasing condition. Performing a restore operation increases the future endurance of the resistive change memory cell and therefore increases the number of set reset cycles the resistive change memory cell can undergo to a value greater than the cell s specified write endurance.

In the implementation shown in a pair of bit lines e.g. BLA and BLOB shares a single read write circuit e.g. as controlled by the transistors and . Bit line BLA is coupled to read write circuit and to a pull down transistor by applying a logic high H column select signal CS to the gate of a respective transistor thereby turning on the respective transistor . Additionally a logic low L column select signal CS is applied to the gate of a respective transistor to decouple bit line BLOB from read write circuit . Likewise bit line BLOB is coupled to read write circuit and to a pull down transistor by applying a logic high H column select signal CS to the gate of a respective transistor . Additionally a logic low L column select signal CS is applied to the gate of a respective transistor to decouple bit line BLA from read write circuit .

Each of the word lines WL WL and WL bit lines BLA BLOB BLA BLB BLA and BLB and source line SL is a distinct conductive line. A source line SL connects to each resistive change memory cell in the array . For example the source line SL connects to the resistive memory element of each resistive change memory cell e.g. via node . The source line SL also connects to the drains of pull up transistors e.g. p type MOSFETs and . The source of the pull up transistor connects to a power supply that supplies a reset voltage Vand the source of the pull up transistor connects to a power supply that supplies a restore voltage V. The source line SL thus can be coupled to either Vor Vvia respective pull up transistors and . For example the source line SL is coupled to Vwhen a logic low L complementary write enable signal EN WR is applied to the gate of the pull up transistor and is coupled to Vwhen a logic low L complementary restore enable signal EN RE is applied to the gate of the pull up transistor . A restore enable signal EN RE e.g. the complement of EN RE is also applied to the gates of the pull down transistors the drains of which are connected to ground sometimes herein called circuit ground . The source line SL thus is coupled to Vduring a restore operation while any bit lines coupled to the transistors through transistors or are simultaneously grounded. In some implementations the array includes a plurality of source lines. In these implementations a respective source line connects a respective subset of resistive change memory cells in the array . In one example a respective source line is connected to the resistive change memory cells in each word line in other examples a respective source line is connected to the resistive change memory cells in two or more word lines a respective source line is connected to the resistive change memory cells in each bit line or a respective source line is connected to the resistive change memory cells in two or more bit lines. The pull down transistors pull up transistors and and power supplies supplying the voltages Vand Vtogether constitute control circuitry e.g. control circuitry . The pull down transistors and pull up transistors and serve as bias circuits to ground the bit lines and couple the source line SL to either voltage Vor voltage V respectively.

In the example of biasing conditions are applied to the resistive change memory cells and to simultaneously perform or perform within a predetermined time each other a set operation for the resistive change memory cell and a reset operation for the resistive change memory cell while not programming the resistive change memory cell . A logic high signal is applied to the word line WL to turn on the pass gates in the row corresponding to the word line WL and thereby couple the resistive memory elements in the row to the corresponding bit lines. Logic low signals are applied to the other word lines WL WL etc. to decouple the resistive memory elements in these rows from the corresponding bit lines. A logic high column select signal CS is applied to the transistors to couple the bit lines BLA BLA and BLA to respective read write circuits and while a logic low column select signal CS is applied to the transistors to decouple the bit lines BLOB BLB and BLB from the respective read write circuits and . The read write circuit provides a voltage of V V to the bit line BLA. Simultaneously or within a predetermined time of each other the read write circuit provides a voltage of 0V to the bit line BLA and the read write circuit provides a voltage of Vto the bit line BLA A logic low complementary write enable signal EN WR is applied to the gate of the pull up transistor thus turning on the pull up transistor and providing a voltage of Vto the source line SL. The voltage applied to each of the resistive change memory cells and is the difference between the respective bit line voltage and the source line SL voltage. The voltage applied to resistive change memory cell is V V V V so that a set operation is performed on resistive change memory cell . The voltage applied to resistive change memory cell is 0 V V so that a reset operation is performed on resistive change memory cell . The voltage applied to resistive change memory cell is V V 0V so that neither a set nor a reset operation is performed on resistive change memory cell as a result resistive change memory cell remains in its previous state. As discussed above the voltage applied to each of the resistive change memory cells and is removed after a duration appropriate for the programming operation.

In the example of a logic high signal is applied to the word line WL and logic low signals are applied to the other word lines WL WL etc. thus enabling access to resistive change memory cells in the row corresponding to word line WL but not to resistive change memory cells in the other rows. A logic high column select signal CS is applied to the transistors and a logic low column select signal CS is applied to the transistors thereby coupling the resistive change memory cells to be restored to the pull down transistors via corresponding bit lines BLA BLA BLA etc. A logic high restore enable signal EN RE is applied to the gates of the transistors thus grounding the bit lines BLA BLA BLA etc. A logic low complementary restore enable signal EN RE is applied to the gate of the transistor thereby providing Vto the source line SL. The voltage across the resistive change memory cells to be restored is the difference between the bit line and source line SL voltages which equals V the voltage corresponding to the restore operation. The restore voltage applied to the resistive change memory cells and is removed after a duration appropriate for the restore operation.

The examples of include a first power supply to supply a first voltage Vwhen programming operations e.g. set and reset operations are performed on the resistive change memory cells and a second power supply to supply a second voltage Vfor when performing a restore operation on the resistive change memory cells . In some embodiments however a single configurable power supply supplies both voltages. illustrates an array in which the source line SL is coupled to a configurable power supply via a pull up transistor e.g. a p type MOSFET controlled by a complementary enable signal EN. The complementary enable signal EN is asserted both for programming and restore operations to couple the source line SL to the configurable power supply which supplies a voltage Vduring these operations. The configurable power supply is configurable to provide voltage Vduring programming operations e.g. set and reset operations and voltage Vduring restore operations. The pull down transistors pull up transistor and configurable power supply together constitute control circuitry e.g. control circuitry .

To perform a reset operation for the resistive change memory cell transistors and are turned on. The read write circuit or alternatively the respective pull down transistor grounds the bit line BLA and the first power supply supplies the first voltage Vcorresponding to the reset operation e.g. V V to the conductive line L. The first voltage Vapplied to the resistive change memory cell is removed after a predetermined duration appropriate for the reset operation.

To perform a restore operation for the resistive change memory cell the transistors and are turned on. The respective pull down transistor or alternatively the read write circuit grounds the bit line BLA and the second power supply supplies the second voltage Vcorresponding to the restore operation e.g. V V to the conductive line L. The second voltage Vapplied to the resistive change memory cell is removed after a duration appropriate for the restore operation.

Restore operations may be performed in parallel for multiple resistive change memory cells in one or more rows e.g. every other resistive change memory cell in a row every resistive change memory cell in a row or every resistive change memory cell in the array through appropriate biasing of the conductive lines and bit lines by analogy to the three terminal examples of . Similarly reset operations may be performed in parallel for multiple resistive change memory cells in one or more rows.

To perform a set operation for resistive change memory cell the transistor is turned on the write read circuit provides a voltage corresponding to the set operation e.g. V V to the bit line BLA and the conductive line L is grounded e.g. using a pull down transistor not shown . The voltage corresponding to the set operation applied to the resistive change memory cell is removed after a duration appropriate for the set operation.

In some embodiments the first power supply and the second power supply are replaced with a single configurable power supply that is configurable to supply the first voltage Vand the second voltage V during reset and restore operations respectively by analogy to the configurable power supply supplying the voltage Vof . For example the single configurable power supply is configurable to supply 0V the first voltage V and the second voltage V during set reset and restore operations respectively.

In some embodiments resistive change memory cells to be restored e.g. in accordance with the examples of are reset before being restored to avoid high currents on the corresponding bit lines and source lines or word lines during the restore operation.

The following discussion refers to either of the read write circuits illustrated in . The sense amplifier determines values of data read from resistive change memory cells connected to the bit line s and provides the determined values to the data latch . Data latch stores the values of the data and forwards the values onto a data bus . Data bus is coupled for example to an interface e.g. interface to transmit the data to a separate device e.g. to a memory controller that requested the data. Data bus also provides data to data latch e.g. data provided by a memory controller for storage in the resistive change memory device . Data latch stores the data and forwards the data to write driver which drives the data onto bit line s by supplying to the bit line s the appropriate voltages for set or reset operations depending on the value s of the data. Write driver thus is used to program resistive change memory cells connected to the bit line s . Examples of this programming are described above with respect to . Data latch also provides data to write driver during a refresh operation or a restore operation as described in more detail below.

In some embodiments restore operations are performed on resistive change memory cells in a single row as described with regard to . In some of these embodiments the data from the resistive change memory cells is stored in data latches before the restore operation and then written back to the resistive change memory cells after the restore operation thus allowing the data to be retained. Before the restore operation sense amplifiers read the data from the resistive change memory cells and provide the data to the data latches . After the restore operation the data latches provide the data to the write drivers which program the data back into the resistive change memory cells. Alternatively the data is stored in a buffer in the resistive change memory device e.g. the buffer or in an external device during the restore operation.

In some embodiments memory device includes a buffer to store data from resistive change memory cells being restored. Prior to a restore operation data from the resistive change memory cells to be restored is read by read write circuitry and provided to buffer for storage. After the restore operation buffer provides the data to the read write circuitry which writes the data back into the restored resistive change memory cells. In some embodiments buffer is used to store data from resistive change memory cells in multiple rows that are being restored in parallel. In some embodiments when restoring resistive change memory cells in a single row the data is stored in buffer or alternatively in data latches e.g. .

In some embodiments the resistive change memory cells in array have limited data retention times and thus are volatile. In other embodiments the resistive change memory cells are nonvolatile. In embodiments with volatile resistive change memory cells memory device includes a refresh control circuit to periodically refresh the data in the resistive change memory cells. These periodic refresh operations are referred to as refresh cycles. Refresh control circuit is coupled to control circuitry to instruct control circuitry to perform restore operations during the refresh cycles as described below for the method for example.

In some embodiments interface is configured to receive commands to perform restore operations. The commands are received for example from an external device e.g. a memory controller . In response to such a command interface instructs control circuitry to perform a restore operation as described below for the method for example.

In some embodiments memory device includes a register to store one or more settings for restore operations. For example in some implementations register stores a setting specifying the restore voltage Vto be used for the restore operations and or a setting specifying the duration for which the restore voltage Vis applied during the restore operations. Alternatively register stores a setting specifying a restore current to be used for the restore operations and or a setting specifying the duration for which the restore current is applied during the restore operations. Register is coupled to control circuitry to apply the setting s to control circuitry . In some embodiments the setting s stored in register are set externally. For example interface receives a command from an external device specifying one or more settings in response the specified setting s are stored in register .

A first biasing condition is applied to a resistive change memory cell for a reset operation. In some embodiments the resistive change memory cell is coupled to a first power supply e.g. the power supply providing the voltage Vin that supplies the voltage of the first biasing condition. In some embodiments a configurable power supply e.g. the configurable power supply producing the voltage Vin in the resistive change memory device is configured to provide the voltage of the first biasing condition. As discussed above in accordance with the first biasing condition the voltage for the reset operation is applied to the resistive change memory cell for a first predetermined duration.

A second biasing condition is applied to the resistive change memory cell for a restore operation to counteract a decrease in resistance of the resistive memory element for a reset state. At least one of a voltage current and duration of the second biasing condition is greater than a corresponding voltage current or duration of the first biasing condition. In some embodiments the resistive change memory cell is coupled to a second power supply e.g. the power supply providing the voltage Vin that supplies the voltage of the second biasing condition. In some embodiments the adjustable power supply e.g. the configurable power supply producing the voltage Vin is reconfigured to provide the voltage of the second biasing condition which is greater than the voltage of the first biasing condition. As discussed above in accordance with the second biasing condition the voltage for the restore operation is applied to the resistive change memory cell for a second predetermined duration.

Note that the difference between the first predetermined duration and the second predetermined duration and the magnitudes of the voltages associated with the application of the first biasing condition and the second biasing condition discussed above with reference to apply to the discussion of .

In some embodiments before applying the second biasing condition to the resistive change memory cell data is read from the resistive change memory cell e.g. using a sense amplifier and stored e.g. in data latch or buffer . After applying the second biasing condition to the resistive change memory cell the stored data is written back to the resistive change memory cell e.g. using the write driver .

In some embodiments applying the second biasing condition is performed simultaneously or performed within a predetermined time of each other for multiple resistive change memory cells. For example the second biasing condition is applied in parallel to multiple resistive change memory cells in a row to every resistive change memory cell in a row to multiple resistive change memory cells or every resistive change memory cell in multiple rows and or to every resistive change memory cell in an array e.g. array A D or array . In some embodiments the read operation is performed on every resistive change memory cell to be restored and the write operation is performed on every resistive change memory cell that has been restored.

Method thus helps to counteract a decrease in the reset resistance of a resistive memory element in a resistive change memory cell resulting from repeated use of the resistive change memory cell. While method includes a number of operations that appear to occur in a specific order method can include more or fewer operations an order of two or more operations may be changed and or two or more operations may be combined into a single operation.

A restore operation may be performed in response to a command e.g. a command from an external device as illustrated in the method of in accordance with some embodiments. In method a command is received at a resistive change memory device e.g. at interface of memory device to perform a restore operation for one or more resistive change memory cells e.g. one or more resistive change memory cells in array or array . In response to the command the restore operation is performed the second biasing condition is applied to the one or more resistive change memory cells e.g. in accordance with the applying operation .

In some embodiments before performing the restore operation data is read from the one or more resistive change memory cells e.g. using sense amplifiers and stored e.g. in data latches or buffer . After performing the restore operation the stored data is written back to the one or more resistive change memory cells e.g. using write drivers .

Method thus provides a technique for controlling performance of a restore operation. While method includes a number of operations that appear to occur in a specific order method can include more or fewer operations and or two or more operations may be combined into a single operation.

A restore operation may be performed during a refresh cycle as illustrated in the method of in accordance with some embodiments in which the resistive change memory cells are volatile. In method a refresh cycle is initiated in a resistive change memory device e.g. the device . For example the refresh cycle is initiated under the control of refresh control circuit . In response data is read from the resistive change memory cells to be refreshed e.g. using sense amplifiers and stored e.g. in data latches or buffer . The restore operation is performed the second biasing condition is applied to the resistive change memory cells being refreshed e.g. in accordance with the applying operation . After performing the restore operation the stored data is written back to the resistive change memory cells being refreshed e.g. using write drivers .

Method thus provides another technique for controlling performance of a restore operation. While method includes a number of operations that appear to occur in a specific order method can include more or fewer operations and or two or more operations may be combined into a single operation.

Methods illustrate examples in which restore operations are performed in response to commands or refresh operations. Other examples of conditions that in various implementations trigger performance of restore operations include powering on the system that includes the resistive change memory device calibrating the system that includes the resistive change memory device performing a specified number of programming operations and or passage of a specified time.

In some embodiments performance of a restore operation is triggered based on the result of a characterization operation to identify degradation of a resistive change memory cell. For example read currents for resistive change memory cells in a reset state are compared to a reference current to determine whether the reset resistance of one or more of the resistive change memory cells has decreased below a specified threshold. Examples of reference currents for characterization operations as well as for read operations are shown in .

The graph A also shows a reference current I that is less than the reference current I but greater than I before the resistive change memory cell has been subjected to any set reset cycles. The reference current I corresponds to a reset resistance of the resistive change memory cell after a number of set reset cycles. At this point the resistive change memory cell s reset resistance has decreased somewhat but is still sufficiently high that the read current in the reset state can be rapidly and reliably distinguished from the read current in the set state. The reference current I is used to perform a characterization operation 

the resistive change memory cell is reset and its read current in the reset state I is compared to the reference current I. If I is greater than the reference current I the reset resistance of the resistive change memory cell is determined to have decreased below a resistance threshold corresponding to the reference current I e.g. equal to a bit line voltage divided by the reference current I . A reset resistance less than the resistance threshold provides an indication that the future endurance of the memory cell is less than a threshold future endurance and the memory cell should be subject to a restore operation.

In some embodiments characterization operations are performed using multiple reference currents. shows a prophetic example of a graph B that corresponds to the graph A but includes additional reference currents beyond the reference currents I and I. A reference current I corresponds to a reset resistance of the resistive change memory cell after a number of set reset cycles and a reference current I corresponds to a reset resistance of the resistive change memory cell after a number of set reset cycles. To perform a characterization operation the resistive change memory cell is reset and its read current I is compared e.g. serially or in parallel to each of the multiple reference currents I I and I. Use of multiple reference currents I I and I in the characterization operation allows resistive change memory cells to be sorted into multiple bins based on their degrees of degradation and hence their future endurances.

The examples of involve decreases in a resistive change memory cell s reset resistance as the resistive change memory cell is repeatedly programmed. In other prophetic examples a resistive change memory cell s set resistance i.e. its resistance in a low resistance set state increases or decreases as the resistive change memory cell is subjected to set reset cycles. In such examples characterization operations are performed using one or more reference currents that are greater than the reference current I used for read operations. Such characterization operations identify resistive change memory cells that are still functional but have set resistances that have increased above resistance thresholds corresponding to the one or more reference currents e.g. resistance thresholds equal to a bit line voltage divided by respective ones of the one or more reference currents . A set resistance greater than a resistance threshold provides an indication that the future endurance of the memory cell is less than a threshold future endurance and the memory cell should be subject to a restore operation.

The circuitry also includes a reference current generator that generates a reference current I e.g. reference current I I or I for use during characterization operations and a reference current generator that generates a reference currentI e.g. reference current I I for use during read operations. For a specified supply voltage the reference current generators and generate distinct reference currents. In some implementations a mode control circuit generates read enable signal EN READ during read operations. During a read operation the read enable signal EN READ turns on a transistor which provides read reference current Ito the line via a current mirror . If Iis greater than I which occurs when the resistive change memory cell is in a set state the node charges and a pair of inverters connected to the node outputs a result signal of 1 i.e. logic high . If Iis less than I which occurs when the resistive change memory cell is in a reset state the node discharges and the pair of inverters connected to the node outputs a result signal of 0 i.e. logic low . In embodiments in which the set state corresponds to a stored value of 0 in the resistive change memory cell and the reset state corresponds to a stored value of 1 the result signal in the read operation gives the complement of the stored value. In embodiments in which the set state corresponds to a stored value of 1 in the resistive change memory cell and the reset state corresponds to a stored value of 0 the result signal in the read operation gives the stored value.

In some implementations mode control circuit generates characterization enable signal EN CHAR during characterization operations. During a characterization operation the characterization enable signal EN CHAR turns on a transistor which provides characterization reference current Ito the line via a current mirror . If Iis greater than I the node charges and the pair of inverters connected to the node outputs a result signal of 1. If Iis less than I the node discharges and the pair of inverters connected to the node outputs a result signal of 0. For a characterization operation performed to determine whether the reset resistance of the resistive change memory cell has decreased below the threshold corresponding to I a value of 1 for the result signal indicates that the reset resistance indeed has decreased below the threshold while a value of 0 for the result signal indicates that the reset resistance has not decreased below the threshold. A 1 in this context thus is considered to be a failing result with respect to the threshold. For a characterization operation performed to determine whether the set resistance of the resistive change memory cell has increased above the threshold corresponding to I a value of 0 for the result signal indicates that the set resistance has increased above the threshold while a value of 1 for the result signal indicates that the set resistance has not increased above the threshold. A 0 in this context thus is considered to be a failing result with respect to the threshold.

The inverter pair current mirror and line together constitute a sense amplifier used to both read and characterize resistive change memory cells as described. This sense amplifier is an example of sense amplifier . Note that the sense amplifier illustrated in is simplified for the sake of clarity. For example in some implementations the sense amplifier includes precharge and or enable circuitry. Also note that the sense amplifiers illustrated in are simply examples. Other types of sense amplifiers may be used. In some embodiments transistor current mirror and reference current generator are not present or not used . In these embodiments the current Iis set to the appropriate value for a particular characterization operation.

In some embodiments reference currents e.g. Iand I are generated using reference resistive change memory cells. For example illustrates an array of resistive change memory cells in a resistive change memory device that includes both resistive change memory cells for storing data and reference resistive change memory cells for generating reference currents. In rows of resistive change memory cells correspond to respective word lines WL WL etc. Each row of resistive change memory cells includes n resistive change memory cells where n is an integer greater than 1 that are accessible for write and read operations and thus are used to store data as well as a first reference resistive change memory cell to generate read reference current Iand a second reference resistive change memory cell to generate characterization reference current I. In the example shown in the row corresponding to word line WL includes resistive change memory cells A and C for storing data reference resistive change memory cell E for generating I and reference resistive change memory cell G for generating I. Likewise the row corresponding to word line WL includes resistive change memory cells B and D for storing data reference resistive change memory cell F for generating I and reference resistive change memory cell H for generating I. While illustrates an array of resistive change memory cells in other embodiments resistive change memory cells or are used.

Each column of resistive change memory cells for storing data is coupled via a bit line and column select transistor to a sense amplifier used during read operations to determine values stored in respective resistive change memory cells. For example the resistive change memory cells A and B along the column corresponding to bit line BL are coupled to sense amplifier via bit line BL and column select transistor . Likewise the resistive change memory cells C and D along the column corresponding to bit line BLn are coupled to sense amplifier via bit line BLn and column select transistor . The column select transistors through correspond to transistors or . To perform a read or characterization operation a logic high signal is applied to the word line e.g. WL or WL of the row being read or characterized and column select transistors corresponding to the columns being read or characterized are turned on thereby coupling the resistive change memory cells being read or characterized to corresponding sense amplifiers . For example every column select transistor through is turned on to connect every resistive change memory cell that stores data in a specified row to a corresponding sense amplifier through . Each sense amplifier compares the bit line current Ito a reference current and the inverter pair produces a signal indicating a result of the read or characterization operation for a given column as described for .

In embodiments depicted by the reference currents used by sense amplifiers through are generated using reference resistive change memory cells and current mirrors. Bit line BLis connected to reference resistive change memory cells E F used to generate Iand bit line BLis connected to reference resistive change memory cells G H used to generate I. During a read operation a logic high EN READ signal is applied to transistor a logic high signal is applied to a respective word line e.g. WL or WL and source line SL is grounded e.g. connected to the circuit ground of the resistive change memory device thus coupling a respective resistive change memory cell e.g. E or F to a current mirror and causing a reference current Ito flow along bit line BL. The reference current Icorresponds to the read current of the respective reference resistive change memory cell e.g. resistive change memory cell E or F . Similarly during a characterization operation a logic high EN CHAR signal is applied to transistor a logic high signal is applied to a respective word line e.g. WL or WL and source line SL is grounded or coupled to a predetermined voltage thus coupling a respective resistive change memory cell e.g. G or H to the current mirror and causing a reference current Ithat corresponds to the read current of the respective reference resistive change memory cell e.g. resistive change memory cell G or H to flow along bit line BL. In both operations current mirror multiplies Iby a factor M and provides the multiplied current M Ito a transistor . In some implementations the factor M is used to adjust the multiplied current M Ifor margining. In some implementations the factor M is greater than 0. Transistor is connected to transistors through in sense amplifiers through in current mirror configurations that mirror the multiplied current M Iinto sense amplifiers through . The current mirror and transistor together constitute a configurable reference current generator . Along with the transistors and configurable reference current generator thus multiplexes multiple reference currents into sense amplifiers through . Note that although illustrates a common source line that runs parallel to and is shared by multiple word lines other configurations of the source line may be used. In some implementations each word line has a corresponding and unique source line. In some implementations a common source line runs parallel to and is shared by multiple bit lines. In some implementations each bit line has a corresponding and unique source line.

Each sense amplifier compares a respective bit line current Ito M I the inverter pairs produce result signals indicating the results of these comparisons as described with reference to . The reference resistive change memory cells E H are designed with resistive memory elements configured to have read currents that when multiplied by M provide the desired reference currents. In some embodiments the reference resistive change memory cells E F for read operations are initially programmed to set states and the reference resistive change memory cells G H for characterization operations are initially programmed to reset states. For the resistive change memory cells along bit line BL M Iequals I . For the resistive change memory cells along bit line BL M Iequals I . Use of reference resistive change memory cells to generate reference currents accounts for manufacturing process variation that affects the resistive change memory cells being read or characterized and thus results in more accurate read and characterization operations.

During a characterization operation the output of each inverter pair is coupled to the gate of a pull down transistor e.g. an n type MOSFET . For example in some implementations a multiplexer or a pass gate or a transmission gate is used to couple an output of an inverter pair to the gate of a pull down transistor . Note that the circuitry used to output data to a data bus during a read operation is described below. The source of each pull down transistor connects to a ROWFAIL signal line . A pull up transistor precharges the signal line . In a characterization operation performed to determine whether the reset resistance of one or more resistive change memory cells has decreased below the threshold corresponding to I a FAIL signal of 1 from an inverter pair indicates that the reset resistance of a respective resistive change memory cell has decreased below the threshold. The FAIL signal of 1 turns on a respective pull down transistor which pulls down the ROW FAIL signal line . An inverter outputs the complement of the value on the ROWFAIL signal line and thus provides a ROWFAIL signal that equals 1 if the reset resistance of at least one resistive change memory cell in the row of resistive change memory cells being characterized has decreased below i.e. below the threshold and otherwise equals 0. The ROWFAIL signal line transistors and and inverter together constitute wired OR detection circuitry coupled to the sense amplifiers through to generate a fail signal e.g. ROW FAIL 1 in response to a determination by any one of the sense amplifiers through that the future endurance of a respective resistive change memory cell does not satisfy a specified future endurance threshold.

In a characterization operation performed to determine whether the set resistance of one or more resistive change memory cells has increased above the threshold corresponding to I a FAIL signal of 0 from an inverter pair indicates that the set resistance of a respective resistive change memory cell has increased above the threshold. Accordingly in some embodiments for performing such an operation a third inverter is added in series with the inverter pair .

In some embodiments the current mirror for each sense amplifier includes multiple parallel outputs e.g. parallel mirrored current branches each of which is coupled to its own instance of transistor and its own instance of inverter pair which in turn are coupled its own instance of the wired OR detection circuitry and the FAIL signal. In these embodiments multiple characterization operations with distinct reference currents are performed simultaneously. Furthermore these embodiments allow a characterization operation to be performed simultaneously with a read operation.

During a read operation the output of each inverter pair is coupled to a data bus not shown . For example a multiplexer or a pass gate or a transmission gate is used to couple an output of an inverter pair to the data bus. In some embodiments sense amplifiers through are examples of sense amplifiers as found for example in read write circuits . While write drivers are not shown in for clarity write drivers are present e.g. are arranged in accordance with A and B . For example write drivers are used to program resistive change memory cells by biasing bit lines BL through BLn to appropriate voltages for a predetermined duration while source line SL is biased to V as described with respect to . Also while transistors are not shown in for clarity in some embodiments transistors are included for performing restore operations. For example a restore operation is performed for a group e.g. a row of resistive change memory cells in response to an indication by the ROWFAIL signal that at least one resistive change memory cell in the group has degraded beyond a threshold corresponding to I. In some embodiments prior to performing a characterization operation the resistive change memory cells being characterized are placed in the reset state. In some embodiments when performing a characterization operation simultaneously with a read operation only the resistive change memory cells that are in the reset state are characterized.

In some implementations array includes an array of reference resistive change memory cells e.g. resistive change memory cells E H that is coupled to a reference current generator e.g. configurable reference current generator . The reference current generator is configurable to provide any of multiple reference currents e.g. Iand one or more Icurrents to the read write circuitry for respective read and characterization operations.

The row fail detection circuitry produces a result signal e.g. ROW FAIL that is stored in a result register which provides the result signal to an interface for transmission to an external device e.g. a memory controller . Interface is an example of interface . Alternatively the row fail detection circuitry provides the result signal directly to interface . In some embodiments the result signal is stored in the result register as a single bit value that indicates the result of a characterization operation performed using a single reference current e.g. I . In other embodiments the result signal is stored in the result register as a multi bit value that indicates the result of a characterization operation performed using multiple reference currents e.g. I and or .

A mode control circuit is coupled to read write circuitry and reference current generator . Mode control circuit instructs the read write circuitry and reference current generator to enter a first mode e.g. a normal operating mode to perform read and write operations and to enter a second mode e.g. a test mode to perform characterization operations. In some embodiments the mode control circuit specifies the mode in response to a command or instruction received from an external device e.g. a memory controller via interface . In some embodiments mode control circuit includes one or more state machines for carrying out the sequences of internal operations to perform memory operations corresponding to commands received from an external device such as a memory controller.

In some implementations the interface is not present in the resistive change memory device . In these implementations the result register provides the result signal directly to an external device and the mode control circuit receives a command or instruction from an external device directly.

Attention is now directed to methods of performing read and characterization commands. is a flow diagram illustrating a method of operating a resistive change memory device e.g. device device in different modes in accordance with some embodiments.

In a first mode of operation e.g. a normal mode of operation a read command is received from a memory controller e.g. controller .

In response to the read command a parameter e.g. read current or resistance associated with a resistive change memory cell e.g. the resistive change memory cell or of the resistive change memory device is compared to a first threshold to determine a value of a bit stored in the resistive change memory cell. The parameter is sometimes called a characteristic of the resistive change memory cell being read. In some implementations the parameter corresponds to a resistance of the resistive change memory cell in a reset or set state and the first threshold corresponds to a first resistance threshold. In some implementations the parameter is a read current of the resistive change memory cell in a reset or set state and the first threshold is a first reference current e.g. I . For example as shown in Ifor resistive change memory cell is compared to I. In another example as shown in Ifor resistive change memory cell A or B is compared to I M I where Iis generated using reference resistive change memory cell E or F . In some implementations the reference current generator is configured to provide the first reference current in the first mode of operation.

In a second mode of operation e.g. a test mode a characterization command is received from the memory controller.

In response to the characterization command the parameter associated with the resistive change memory cell is compared to a second threshold to produce a result signal that provides an indication of the future endurance of the resistive change memory cell. In some embodiments the result signal is a binary signal that indicates whether the future endurance is greater or less than a minimum future endurance. For example Ifor resistive change memory cell is compared to I as shown in to produce a result signal that provides an indication of the future endurance of the resistive change memory cell. In another example Ifor resistive change memory cell A or B is compared to I M I where Iis generated using reference resistive change memory cell G or H to produce a result signal that provides an indication of the future endurance of the resistive change memory cell as shown in .

The second threshold used for characterization is stricter than the first threshold used for read write operations . Because the second threshold is stricter than the first threshold the second threshold can be used to detect degradation of a resistive change memory cell from which data still can be read. In some embodiments the second threshold corresponds to a second resistance threshold that is greater or less than the first resistance threshold. In some embodiments the second threshold is a second reference current e.g. I or that is less or greater than the first reference current e.g. I . For example in implementations in which the characterization is to detect a decrease in reset resistance the second resistance threshold is greater than the first resistance threshold and the second reference current is less than the first reference current. In implementations in which the characterization is to detect an increase in set resistance the second resistance threshold is less than the first resistance threshold and the second reference current is greater than the first reference current. In some implementations the reference current generator is configured to provide the second reference current in the second mode of operation.

Based on the comparison in operation the result signal e.g. a result signal generated by row fail detection circuitry is transmitted to the memory controller. The result signal provides an indication of the future endurance of the resistive change memory cell. Alternatively information based on the result signal is sent to the memory controller. For example as described with respect to in some implementations comparison results from multiple resistive change memory cells are combined and the resulting combined signal s e.g. a ROW FAIL signal is are sent to the memory controller. In some embodiments a value e.g. a single bit value corresponding to the result signal is stored in a register e.g. result register .

In some embodiments multiple thresholds e.g. reference currents and or distinct from the first threshold e.g. reference current are specified and compared to the parameter. These multiple comparisons are performed serially or in parallel. For example the second reference current e.g. I and a third reference current e.g. I and or are both compared to the parameter either serially or in parallel. The comparisons produce respective result signals e.g. respective ROW FAIL signals . In some embodiments a multi bit value corresponding to the result signals is stored in the register.

In some embodiments prior to performing operation the resistive change memory cell is first read and furthermore the characterization operation is only performed on the resistive memory change cell when the resistive change memory cell is in the reset state. In some implementations the read operation and the characterization operation are performed serially where the read operation is performed prior to the characterization operation. For example the first mode of operation is used during a first memory operation cycle and the second mode of operation is used during a second memory operation cycle. In some implementations the read operation and the characterization operation are performed in parallel e.g. during the same memory operation cycle . In these implementations the characterization operation is performed in the same memory operation cycle as the read operation but the characterization operation is performed a predetermined time after the read operation is performed where the predetermined time is selected so that the read operation is completed prior to starting the characterization operation and where the read operation and the characterization operation are performed in the same memory operation cycle.

Method thus allows a resistive change memory device to perform both read and characterization operations depending on the mode of operation. While method includes a number of operations that appear to occur in a specific order method can include more or fewer operations an order of two or more operations may be changed and or two or more operations may be combined into a single operation. For example the operations and may be performed after the operations . In another example the operation is performed before the operation or is omitted.

In the method a first instruction is transmitted to the resistive change memory device to perform a read operation for a first set e.g. a row of resistive change memory cells e.g. resistive change memory cells or in the resistive change memory device in accordance with a first threshold e.g. the first threshold of operation . In some implementations the first instruction commands the resistive change memory device to compare read currents of the first set of resistive change memory cells with a first reference current. In some implementations the reference current generator is configured to provide the first reference current. In some implementations the first threshold corresponds to a first resistance threshold. For example the first instruction corresponds to the read command in operation and commands the resistive change memory device to perform operation .

In response to the first instruction data stored in the first set of resistive change memory cells is received from the resistive change memory device.

A second instruction is transmitted to the resistive change memory device to characterize a second set e.g. a row of resistive change memory cells in the resistive change memory device in accordance with a second threshold e.g. the second threshold of operation . The second threshold is stricter than the first threshold. In some implementations the second instruction commands the resistive change memory device to compare read currents of the second set of resistive change memory cells with a second reference current. In some implementations the reference current generator is configured to provide the second reference current. In some implementations the second threshold corresponds to a second resistance threshold. For example the second instructions corresponds to the characterization command in operation and commands the resistive change memory device to perform operations .

In some embodiments prior to transmitting the second instruction the memory controller transmits a third instruction to the resistive change memory device to program the second set of resistive change memory cells to a reset state or alternatively to a set state . For example the third instruction commands the resistive change memory device to perform operation .

In response to the second instruction a result signal e.g. a result signal generated by row fail detection circuitry that provides an indication of the future endurance of the second set of resistive change memory cells is received from the resistive change memory device. In some embodiments the result signal indicates whether at least one resistive change memory cell of the second set has a read current in a reset or set state that is greater or less than the second reference current. In some embodiments the result signal indicates whether at least one resistive change memory cell of the second set has a resistance in a reset or set state that is less or greater than the second resistance threshold.

In some implementations the controller responds to an indication that the future endurance of the second set of resistive change memory cells has degraded by issuing a command to the resistive change memory device to perform a restore operation for the second set of resistive change memory cells. Alternatively or in addition the controller responds to the indication that the future endurance of the second set of resistive change memory cells has degraded by implementing a wear leveling scheme to reduce usage of the second set of resistive change memory cells.

Method thus allows a memory controller to command a resistive change memory device to perform both read and characterization operations. While method includes a number of operations that appear to occur in a specific order method can include more or fewer operations an order of two or more operations may be changed and or two or more operations may be combined into a single operation. For example the operations and may be performed after the operations and . Optionally the second set of resistive change memory cells that are the subject of the characterization operation in operation is the same set of resistive change memory cells as the first set of resistive change memory cells that are the subject of the read operation in operation .

The resistive change memory cells are characterized in accordance with a specified threshold. In some implementations performing operation includes performing operation . A result signal e.g. a result signal generated by row fail detection circuitry indicating the result of the characterization is provided . For example the result of the characterization is provided to an interface of the memory device e.g. interface of memory device . In some embodiments the specified threshold is a specified reference current e.g. the second reference current of operation and operation .

Method allows data to be retained when a characterization operation is performed for resistive change memory cells storing the data even if the characterization operation involves resetting or setting the resistive change memory cells. While method includes a number of operations that appear to occur in a specific order method can include more or fewer operations and or two or more operations may be combined into a single operation.

A first biasing condition is applied to the resistive change memory cell to program the resistive change memory cell to a reset state. For example operation is performed.

A determination is made that a resistance of the resistive change memory cell in the reset state has decreased below a predefined threshold. In some embodiments making the determination of operation includes performing or instructing the resistive change memory device to perform operation . For example the result signal transmitted by operation provides the determination.

In response to the determination a second biasing condition is applied to the resistive change memory cell for a restore operation to counteract the decrease in resistance of the resistive change memory cell in the reset state. At least one of a voltage current and duration of the second biasing condition is greater than a corresponding voltage current or duration of the first biasing condition. For example the operation is performed.

In some embodiments instead of or in addition to applying the second biasing condition for the restore operation a wear leveling scheme is implemented in response to the determination of operation .

Method thus allows a resistive change memory cell to be restored in response to a determination e.g. via a characterization operation that the resistive change memory cell has degraded. While method includes a number of operations that appear to occur in a specific order method can include more or fewer operations and or two or more operations may be combined into a single operation.

The foregoing description for purpose of explanation has been described with reference to specific embodiments. However the illustrative discussions above are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the claims to the precise forms disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in view of the above teachings. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the inventions and their practical applications to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the inventions and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.
