Embodiments of the invention relate to multimedia and social networking and more specifically to methods systems and user interfaces for prompting social video content interaction.

In recent years a wide variety of common human interactions and activities have moved online and in particular into the realm of social networks. For example social networking systems allow users to designate other users as friends or otherwise connect to or form relationships with other users share photographs and opinions discuss current events play games participate in discussion groups and engage in countless other social interactions.

However developers of social networking systems continually strive to incorporate more real world human behavior within social networks to improve social connections between its users especially in a modem mobile world where people often live or work far away from friends and family. Accordingly finding ways to bring more typical real world interactions into the framework of social networks is of the utmost of importance.

As last mile Internet connectivity bandwidth has increased in the past few years the ability to stream or download high quality online video in a relatively short amount of time has led to a large increase in the demand and consumption of video content using the Internet. The sharing and viewing of video content has also entered the realm of social networking and it has become very common for users of social networks to share personal videos as well as video content from third parties with other users. However when a user views a video posted to a social networking system or other website or application the step of watching the video is currently a non social non interactive experience. Although a user in some systems can typically write some sort of general comment about the video before during or after the viewing the user is not enabled to directly interact with the entities in the video or easily use the social network to discuss or share information about the entities within the video. The same is true for other non Internet based video content such as over the air television content or video played from an optical disc or tape.

Detailed below are embodiments of methods systems and user interfaces for prompting social video content interaction. These user interfaces allow users of social networking systems to when viewing a presentation of a video asset interact with entities within the video asset and share these interactions with other users of the social network. Further embodiments of the invention can automatically prompt a user during the performance of the video asset to undergo a particular interaction with an entity. By suggesting social interactions it is easier for users to interact with the entities of the video asset and become more involved within the social network making the video watching and social networking experience more rewarding for the user and the user s social community of other users in the social network.

In an embodiment of the invention a first user A watches a performance of a video asset . The video asset may be any type of video having a video track comprising one or more frames of visual content and may include but is not limited to animations e.g. hand rendered art computer generated imagery three dimensional objects single or serial video shows e.g. television shows movies clips trailers news programs documentaries infomercials user generated video content e.g. recorded from a user s video camera recorder or device containing a video camera recorder such as a camera phone digital camera digicam laptop personal media player or some other portable electronic device videos generated using video editing software and any other type of video content.

The video asset includes a video track including a visual aspect of the video asset and may optionally include an audio track including an auditory aspect of the video asset . The audio track in is depicted next to the video track for ease of understanding however it is to be understood that the audio track in many embodiments of the invention is not presented using the display A of the user device A.

In embodiments of the invention the video track and or the audio track includes representations of entities which are defined as a person place or thing PPT . For example a person may include a user of the social networking system another person that is not a user of the social networking system an actor or celebrity a fictional or non fictional character played by an actor a musician or composer or director involved with the audio track or a person involved in the making of the video asset e.g. film crew member producer director assistant director editor engineer costume designer wardrobe supervisor make up artist . Further an entity may be a place which in certain embodiments of the invention may include but not be limited to a city region state country building region park continent business organization monument stadium etc. Additionally an entity may be a thing which in embodiments of the invention may include but not be limited to an activity event object clothing jewelry commercial good available for sale animals plants teams sport song audio recording musical genre musical album automobile electronic device etc. In the embodiment depicted in the video track includes several representations of PPTs including a dog named Toto B a girl named Dorothy A and a cowardly lion C similarly the audio track includes representations of PPTs including a voice of Dorothy D and perhaps other representations such as the voices of Toto and or the cowardly lion a soundtrack or song a composer director or musician featured in the soundtrack etc.

In various embodiments of the invention the performance of the video asset may occur using a display A of the user device A a display of a different electronic device or through a projection of the video asset e.g. using a movie projector or other opto mechanical device for displaying motion picture film by projecting it onto a surface such as a projection screen or wall . In embodiments of the invention where the video asset includes an audio track the performance of the video asset may also utilize speaker devices loudspeakers for producing audible sound of the audio track which may be a part of the user device A or different electronic device or connected wired or wirelessly to the user device A or different electronic device.

In an embodiment of the invention the performance of the video asset is initiated by the user A from within a user application e.g. A executed by the user device A. In one such embodiment the user application A is communicatively coupled with the social networking system and may be a web browser or special purpose application. For example the user A may use a browser user application A and click select a link posted on the social networking system to the video asset by another user. However in other embodiments of the invention the performance of the video asset is initiated by other means such as but not limited to a user turning on a television or projector perhaps using a remote control using a digital video disc DVD or Blu Ray player or using a set top box or another device to stream a video using the Internet or local network. In some embodiments of the invention the video asset and or set of PPT entries A N is transferred to the user device A from an external server and in other embodiments the video asset and or set of PPT entries A N is transferred to the user device A from the social networking system .

At circle of according to an embodiment of the invention the social networking system transmits to the user device A a set of PPT entries A N for the video asset . However in some embodiments the set of PPT entries A N are transmitted along with data of the video asset and may be extra commands or data inserted within a stream of data of the video asset .

Each of the set of PPT entries A N includes an interaction point identifier that can be used to identify particular points within the performance of the video asset that include a representation of a PPT. For example in the embodiment depicted in each interaction point identifier comprises a time value or timestamp that indicates a time from the perspective of the beginning of the performance of the video asset that a representation of a PPT occurs. In other embodiments the interaction point identifiers may instead be frame numbers pointers chapter numbers or any other way known to those of skill in the art to refer to particular locations within a performance of a video asset . In the depicted embodiment of each of the set of PPT entries A N also includes an interaction point descriptor that describes the particular PPT in the video asset at the point of that entry s interaction point identifier . In each interaction point descriptor includes an attribute name e.g. Song Character Item for Purchase Place etc. and one or more attribute values e.g. Over the Rainbow Ruby Slippers for each of the attribute names.

At circle the performance of the video asset begins and the display A may include a scrubber user interface UI element and optionally other video controls not illustrated for use by the user A. In an embodiment the scrubber UI element presents a visual indication of the progress of the performance of the video asset and may include a progress indicator element illustrated in as a small black circle . When the performance of the video asset reaches an interaction point identifier from the set of PPT entries A N e.g. PPT entry B with a time value interaction point identifier of 0 22 12 and an attribute name and attribute value of the interaction point descriptor of Characters Dorothy Toto Lion the display A will prompt the user A at circle by generating an interaction UI prompt A. In the embodiment depicted in the interaction UI prompt A is presented as a result of the performance of the video asset reaching the 0 22 12 time point which is the same as the interaction point identifier of PPT entry B. The interaction UI prompt A may be populated based upon the interaction point descriptor of that PPT entry B. In one example the user A may be prompted with for a check in interaction type with the social networking system due to the interaction point descriptor including an attribute name of Characters and the attribute values of Dorothy Toto and Lion may be utilized in the interaction UI prompt A as a result. In some embodiments each interaction point descriptor identifies a particular interaction type and or a particular interaction UI prompt A template to be used for prompting the user A.

The interaction UI prompt A depicted in includes an icon some text representing a prompt and two interaction UI elements A here a Yes button and a No button though many other types of UI elements which are well known to those in the art can be used such as but not limited to sliders checkboxes toggles text input boxes dropdown selectors etc. . In other embodiments the interaction UI prompt A may include more or fewer items. In this depicted embodiment if the user A selects the No interaction UI element A the interaction UI prompt A may simply be hidden. However if the user A selects the Yes interaction UI element A an interaction message not depicted describing the interaction is transmitted at circle back to the social networking system . The interaction message may include one or more of an identifier of the user A an identifier of the user action with respect to the interaction UI elements A e.g. an indication that the user clicked the Yes button an identifier of the video asset and an identifier of the PPT entry B and or interaction point descriptor s .

At circle responsive to receipt of the interaction message from the user device A a post generation module of the social networking system may use data from the interaction message and optionally data from other interaction messages received from the same user device A or other user devices e.g. B N from its store of PPT entries A N from platform storage and or from social graph described below to construct one or more posts A to be displayed to one or more other users e.g. B N of the social networking system . A post is a set of one or more items associated with one or more users of the social networking system and may include text images videos links applications and or other objects. In the embodiment depicted in the post A includes a user icon photograph for user A the name of the user A e.g. Jane Doe some text e.g. is exploring Oz with Dorothy Toto and Lion. and an embedded object allowing the viewing user to watch or launch a viewer to watch a portion of the video asset optionally at or near the time of the interaction point identifier in the performance where the user A was prompted with the interaction UI prompt A . The post is transmitted at circle to one or more other user devices B N of one or more other users B N of the social networking system to be displayed using displays B N. In this manner the initial user A is prompted to interact with an entity i.e. PPT of the video asset the interaction occurs and one or more other users are able to observe the interaction which perhaps will lead to further social networking system interaction via the published posts. For example upon seeing the post A that Jane Doe is exploring Oz . . . other users may comment upon the post and create a discussion related to Dorothy Toto and Lion. 

In an embodiment of the invention the set of PPT entries A N are received by a Video Content Metadata VCM reception module of a video content metadata module . The VCM reception module may receive the PPT entries A N from another computing device through a network e.g. from a server of a person or organization that created or publishes a particular video asset or may receive the PPT entries A N from an Input Output I O device or peripheral of the social networking system such as but not limited to a manual entry by a person using a keyboard and or mouse.

In another embodiment the set of PPT entries A N are automatically generated by the VCM module using a VCM generation module . The VCM generation module may using the video asset perform one or more of an analysis of the audio track e.g. using audio fingerprinting analysis modules and or video track e.g. using facial recognition modules object recognition modules and or optical character recognition OCR modules to identify representations of PPTs A N in the video asset and generate the PPT entries A N as a result. In some embodiments the VCM generation module utilizes metadata already included within or with the video asset to identify entities i.e. PPTs . The VCM generation module may be configured to access the video asset from a storage device e.g. platform storage of the social networking system or access using a physical network interface over a set of networks the video asset from an external server e.g. . For example in an embodiment the VCM generation module determines what a video asset is e.g. a popular movie using metadata included with the video asset file s obtain entity information for the video asset from a third party server or local storage e.g. obtain a list of actors characters directors etc. from a movie database and or obtain known still images of those actors and use the obtained entity information as training information with the analysis modules to recognize the actors within the video track of the video asset and generate the set of PPT entries A N.

A first example is presented at where the first user A while playing a video asset has reached the point in the presentation with an associated PPT entry including an interaction point identifier of 1 21 33 and an interaction point descriptor of Character Wicked Witch of the West . At this point the first user A is prompted for interaction with the interaction UI prompt B asking for the first user s A comments about that character. The interaction UI prompt B includes a text input box interaction UI element B in which the first user A has entered a comment. At this point the social networking system is notified of the interaction and in response generates a post B for the second user C that describes the first user A i.e. the icon and user name the PPT e.g. the Wicked Witch of the West and the user s input.

A second example is presented at where the first user A while playing a video asset has reached the point in the presentation with an associated PPT entry including an interaction point identifier of 0 12 14 and an interaction point descriptor of Song Over the Rainbow . At this point the first user A is prompted for interaction with the interaction UI prompt C asking for the first user s A preferences about that song. The interaction UI prompt C includes two interaction UI element C buttons Yes and No that the first user A may select between. Assuming the first user A selects the Yes button the social networking system is notified of the interaction and in response generates a post C for the second user C that describes the first user A i.e. the icon and user name the PPT e.g. the song Over the Rainbow and the user s input e.g. love of the song . The post C also includes a UI element link and embedded object allowing the second user C to load from the social networking system or another third party server that particular song for listening.

A third example is presented at where the first user A while playing a video asset has reached the point in the presentation with an associated PPT entry including an interaction point identifier of 0 37 43 and an interaction point descriptor of Item for Purchase Ruby Slippers . At this point the first user A is prompted for interaction with the interaction UI prompt D asking for the first user s A preferences about that item and asking if the first user A wishes to purchase that item. The interaction UI prompt D includes two interaction UI elements that the first user A may select between a Love link D and a purchase link Women s Ruby Slippers 49.99 E.

Assuming the first user A selects the Love link D the social networking system is notified of the interaction and in response generates a post D for the second user C that describes the first user A i.e. the icon and user name the PPT e.g. the item Ruby Slippers and the user s input e.g. love of the item .

Assuming the first user A instead selects the purchase link E the display A for the first user A may change to the PPT transaction interface to allow the first user A to begin a purchasing transaction of the item. In various embodiments this change includes opening a web page of a storefront e.g. a home page an item detail page selling the item without interacting with the social networking system to do so see e.g. arrow or with interacting with the social networking system see e.g. arrow opening a new UI element to allow the first user A to purchase the item through the social networking system see e.g. arrow or launching another application to allow the first user A to purchase the item. At some point the social networking system is notified of the selection of the purchase interaction UI element E in an embodiment this occurs after that UI element is selected but in some embodiments this occurs after the first user A has actually purchased the item using one of the above or other purchasing methodologies. In response the social networking system generates a post E for the second user C that describes the first user A e.g. the icon and the user name the PPT e.g. the item Ruby Slippers and the user s input action e.g. the purchase of the slippers . In the depicted example the post E also includes a UI element allowing the second user C to also purchase the ruby slippers Get yours by clicking here .

The top portion of as indicated by arrow illustrates an embodiment of the invention for generating aggregated posts based upon multiple prompted video content interactions for a particular video asset and interaction point. In this embodiment multiple users A C view a performance of a particular video asset e.g. and reach a first interaction point with an associated PPT entry. In some embodiments each of the users A C views the performance on a different user device but in some embodiments each user views the presentation on just one user device and in other embodiments the presentation using a completely different system. Regardless of the means for presenting the video asset upon reaching the first interaction point each user A C is prompted for an interaction with a respective interaction UI prompt A. A. on a respective user device A C. Assuming each user selects the Yes interaction UI element button the social networking system will be notified after each such selection. In this embodiment the social networking system using the post generation module of will aggregate these interactions and generate a post A for one or more other users e.g. D . In the depicted embodiment the post A describes the three users A C e.g. Jane Doe and 2 of your friends and the PPT e.g. the characters Dorothy Toto and Lion . The post C also includes an embedded object allowing the user D to view some or all of the video asset .

The bottom portion of as indicated by arrow illustrates an embodiment of the invention for generating an aggregated post based upon multiple prompted interactions from just one user. In this embodiment user A views the performance of a video asset reaches at least three interaction points and is prompted at least three times with interaction UI prompts A D C . The social networking system then aggregates these multiple interactions from one user A viewing one video asset into one post B to be displayed to one or more other users e.g. user D of the social networking system . This aggregated post B describes the user A e.g. the user icon and user name and the three different interactions with the multiple PPTs Dorothy Toto and Lion Ruby Slippers and Over the Rainbow. 

At block the flow optionally includes causing a performance of a video asset e.g. to be presented to a user of a social networking system. The video asset includes an audio track and a video track. In some embodiments the performance occurs using a user device of the user but in other embodiments the performance occurs using another device or another system. For example in an embodiment the performance of the video asset occurs using a display of one user device e.g. a television coupled to a media streaming device and the interaction UI prompts are displayed using a display of a separate user device e.g. a laptop or mobile telephone this may be implemented by having both user devices be associated with one user account of the social networking system for example. In other embodiments of the invention not utilizing block the performance of the video asset may not be initiated through the social networking system . For example the performance of the video asset may occur through a projector at a theater or through broadcast television. In such embodiments the social networking system and or the user application e.g. A discussed later herein of the user device e.g. A will synchronize the playback of the video asset with the interaction points of the set of PPT entries in various ways which include but are not limited to determining a start of playback of the video asset based upon one or more of the user s geographic location e.g. at a movie theater in the Pacific Time Zone etc. the user s stated actions e.g. a post or check in from the user describing the video asset time of day e.g. television or movie listing information etc.

At block the flow includes responsive to the performance of the video asset reaching a first interaction point where a representation of a person place or thing PPT is included in the audio track or depicted in the video track causing an interaction user interface UI prompt to be presented to the user using a display of a user device of the user. The interaction UI prompt comprises an interaction UI element allowing the user to provide an input that is related to the PPT. In various embodiments the PPT may comprise a fictional or non fictional character a song played in the video asset a good or service depicted in the video asset or apparel or jewelry depicted in the video asset.

Then at block the flow includes receiving the input that is related to the PPT based on the user utilizing the interaction UI element of the interaction UI prompt. Optionally flow continues back to block for one or more subsequent iterations. Ultimately flow further includes at block causing a post that references the user and the PPT to be presented to one or more other users of the social networking system.

In both a first user A and a second user B play i.e. view a performance of a video asset at blocks A B. Then while the performance is not at an interaction point the flows loop see arrows N at A B until an interaction point is detected see arrows Y . At blocks A B each user is displayed an interaction UI prompt related to a PPT included in an audio track or depicted in a video track of the video asset at the first interaction point to the respective user. At blocks A B a user input from each user made using each interaction UI prompt is received. The user input is related to the PPT and may include but is not limited to input data related to the user s opinion of the PPT thoughts about the PPT preference of the PPT e.g. like dislike a check in with the PPT to indicate that the user and the PPT are in some way connected an indication of a desire for the user to follow the PPT and thus subscribe to receiving updates about or from the PPT an indication of a desire to purchase the PPT etc. From block B the flow might continue back to block A B where each user A B continues to watch the video asset. In some embodiments optionally a PPT related event may be triggered which can include opening an interface on the respective user device to allow the user to purchase the PPT e.g. such as when the PPT is a commercially available good or service or to receive more information about the PPT. In some embodiments at some point after receiving user inputs from one or both of the first user i.e. block A and the second user i.e. block B the flow includes displaying based upon one or more of the user inputs a social networking system post to one or more users of the social networking system. The one or more users may include one or both of users A B and or may include other users of the social networking system. For example the one or more users may include users that are friends i.e. directly connected to of either user A or B.

In an embodiment the post will reference one PPT as well as the first user A. In another embodiment the post will reference one PPT as well as both the first user A and the second user B. In some embodiments the post will reference two or more PPTs perhaps from user inputs from the first user A resulting from interaction UI prompts from different interaction points and the first user A. In some embodiments the post will reference two or more PPTs perhaps from user inputs from the first user A and the second user A resulting from interaction UI prompts from different interaction points and the first user A and the second user A.

A social networking system may store records of users and relationships between users in a social graph comprising a plurality of nodes and a plurality of edges connecting the nodes. The nodes may comprise a plurality of user nodes and a plurality of concept nodes.

A user node of the social graph may correspond to a user of the social networking system. A user may be an individual human user an entity e.g. an enterprise business or third party application or a group e.g. of individuals or entities . A user node corresponding to a user may comprise information provided by the user and information gathered by various systems including the social networking system. For example the user may provide his or her name profile picture city of residence contact information birth date gender marital status family status employment educational background preferences interests and other demographic information to be included in the user node. Each user node of the social graph may have a corresponding web page typically known as a profile page . For example in response to a request including a user name the social networking system can access a user node corresponding to the user name and construct a profile page including the name a profile picture and other information associated with the user. A profile page of a first user may display to a second user all or a portion of the first user s information based on one or more privacy settings by the first user and the relationship between the first user and the second user.

A concept node of the social graph may correspond to a concept of the social networking system. For example a concept can represent a real world entity such as a movie a song a sports team a celebrity a group a restaurant or a place or a location. An administrative user of a concept node corresponding to a concept may create or update the concept node by providing information of the concept e.g. by filling out an online form causing the social networking system to associate the information with the concept node. For example and without limitation information associated with a concept can include a name or a title one or more images e.g. an image of cover page of a book a web site e.g. an URL address or contact information e.g. a phone number an email address . Each concept node of the social graph may correspond to a web page. For example in response to a request including a name the social networking system can access a concept node corresponding to the name and construct a web page including the name and other information associated with the concept.

An edge between a pair of nodes in the social graph may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes. For example an edge between two user nodes can represent a friendship between two users. For another example the social networking system may construct a web page or a structured document of a concept node e.g. a restaurant a celebrity incorporating one or more selectable buttons e.g. like check in in the web page. A user can access the page using a web browser hosted by the user s device and select a selectable button causing the user device to transmit to the social networking system a request to create an edge between a user node of the user and a concept node of the concept indicating a relationship between the user and the concept e.g. the user checks in a restaurant or the user likes a celebrity etc. . For example a user may provide or change his or her city of residence causing the social networking system to create an edge between a user node corresponding to the user and a concept node corresponding to the city declared by the user as his or her city of residence. In addition the degree of separation between any two nodes is defined as the minimum number of hops required to traverse the social graph from one node to the other. A degree of separation between two nodes can be considered a measure of relatedness between the users or the concepts represented by the two nodes in the social graph. For example two users having user nodes that are directly connected by an edge i.e. are first degree nodes may be described as connected users or friends. Similarly two users having user nodes that are connected only through another user node i.e. are second degree nodes may be described as friends of friends. 

A social networking system may support a variety of applications such as photo sharing on line calendars and events gaming instant messaging and advertising. For example the social networking system may also include media sharing capabilities. Also the social networking system may allow users to post photographs and other multimedia files to a user s profile page typically known as part of wall posts timeline posts and or stories which can include text objects and or multimedia files etc. or in a photo album both of which may be accessible to other users of the social networking system depending upon the user s configured privacy settings. The social networking system may also allow users to configure events. For example a first user may configure an event with attributes including time and date of the event location of the event and other users invited to the event. The invited users may receive invitations to the event and respond such as by accepting the invitation or declining it . Furthermore the social networking system may allow users to maintain a personal calendar. Similarly to events the calendar entries may include times dates locations and identities of other users.

Typical interactions between the user device A and the social networking system include receiving publications operations to view profiles of other users of the social networking system contributing and interacting with media items joining groups listing and confirming attendance at events checking in at locations liking certain pages posts creating pages and performing other tasks that facilitate social interaction as described herein. Each of these interactions is an exemplary interaction of a user accessing the social networking system as a network service.

The social networking system includes platform storage a video content metadata module as described earlier herein one or more application programming interfaces API s a social graph e.g. as described earlier herein and one or more platform applications . Platform storage can store user preferences settings profile data PPT entries A N etc. Exemplary platform applications include the platform for social interactions e.g. publishing posts pictures etc. as well as social games messaging services and any other application that uses the social platform provided by the social networking system . The social graph may store user nodes concept nodes and edges between nodes as described earlier herein. Each user node may comprise one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with or describing a user. Each concept node may comprise one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with a concept. Each edge between a pair of nodes may comprise one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with a relationship between users or between a user and a concept or between concepts corresponding to the pair of nodes. In particular embodiments the social networking system may comprise one or more computing devices e.g. servers hosting functionality directed to operation of the social networking system.

One or more API s enable external applications to work with the social networking system . For example an external application utilizes an API to authenticate a user based upon the user s social networking log in username and password. Additionally an external application utilizes one or more API s to run the application within the platform application to publish a post to the platform application to access the user s social network connections in the social graph etc. In one embodiment the methods described above or portions thereof are performed by an external application and data is received from and or stored in one or more of the external storage platform storage and social graph .

The data processing system includes memory which is coupled to the microprocessor s . The memory may be used for storing data metadata and programs for execution by the microprocessor s . The memory may include one or more of volatile and non volatile memories such as Random Access Memory RAM Read Only Memory ROM a solid state disk SSD Flash Phase Change Memory PCM or other types of data storage. The memory may be internal or distributed memory.

The data processing system also includes an audio input output subsystem which may include a microphone and or a speaker for for example playing back music or other audio receiving voice instructions to be executed by the microprocessor s playing audio notifications etc. A display controller and display device provides a visual user interface for the user e.g. GUI windows.

The data processing system also includes one or more input or output I O devices and interfaces which are provided to allow a user to provide input to receive output from and otherwise transfer data to and from the system. These I O devices may include a mouse keypad or a keyboard a touch panel or a multi touch input panel camera optical scanner network interface modem other known I O devices or a combination of such I O devices. The touch input panel may be a single touch input panel which is activated with a stylus or a finger or a multi touch input panel which is activated by one finger or a stylus or multiple fingers and the panel is capable of distinguishing between one or two or three or more touches and is capable of providing inputs derived from those touches to the processing system .

The I O devices and interfaces may also include a connector for a dock or a connector for a USB interface FireWire Thunderbolt Ethernet etc. to connect the system with another device external component or a network. Exemplary I O devices and interfaces also include wireless transceivers such as an IEEE 802.11 transceiver an infrared transceiver a Bluetooth transceiver a wireless cellular telephony transceiver e.g. 2G 3G 4G or another wireless protocol to connect the data processing system with another device external component or a network and receive stored instructions data tokens etc. It will be appreciated that one or more buses may be used to interconnect the various components shown in .
