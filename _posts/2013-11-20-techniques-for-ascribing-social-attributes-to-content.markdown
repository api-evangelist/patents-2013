This application is a continuation in part claiming the benefit of priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 010 681 filed Jan. 20 2011 and to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 303 812 filed Nov. 23 2011 which applications are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.

The present application relates generally to data processing systems and in one specific example to techniques for ascribing social attributes to content items and for selecting content to display in a content feed.

Many social network services such as LinkedIn and Facebook include feeds or streams that display various content in reverse chronological order with newer or more recent content appearing higher in the feed. Such feeds or streams are also commonly referred to as news feeds activity feeds network update feeds status feeds data feeds news streams activity streams network update streams status streams data streams and so on.

Example methods and systems for ascribing social attributes to content items and for selecting content to display in a content feed are described. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of example embodiments. It will be evident however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.

According to various embodiments a system is configured to acquire various content accessible via a network such as the Internet e.g. webpages news items articles publications blog posts advertisements etc. and to ascribe various social attributes to that content that describe the types of users that have interacted with the content in various ways. For example the system may ascribe social attributes to an article indicating that for example the article is trending among people that went to school at the University of Michigan or people that work at LinkedIn or people that have the skills of C and Java on LinkedIn or people that have been endorsed for the skill of Product Development on LinkedIn and so on.

Thereafter when a user logs into a website and views a content feed of the website e.g. a content feed associated with an online social network service such as LinkedIn or Facebook the system may analyze various member profile attributes of this logged in user and the system may identify content items that are associated with the social attributes matching the member profile attributes of the visiting member. The system may then display these content items in the content feed. For example if the logged in user is a lawyer that went to the University of Michigan that lives in the Bay Area and that has been endorsed for the skills of criminal law and trial law then the system may identify content items that have been disseminated by or are trending among users with similar social attributes and the system may display such content to the logged in user.

Accordingly the system described herein is configured to ascribe rich deep and highly detailed social attributes to each piece of content acquired from the Internet in order to ultimately provide highly customized content feeds to viewers based on content trending among users associated with attributes e.g. job titles job experience employer employer size seniority level education credentials alumni skills endorsements location and so on that match attributes of the viewer of the content feed. Accordingly viewers of a content feed are provided with content that is highly personalized and relevant to the viewer.

As shown in the data layer includes several databases such as a database for storing profile data including both member profile data as well as profile data for various organizations. Consistent with some embodiments when a person initially registers to become a member of the social network service the person will be prompted to provide some personal information such as his or her name age e.g. birthdate gender interests contact information home town address the names of the member s spouse and or family members educational background e.g. schools majors matriculation and or graduation dates etc. employment history skills professional organizations and so on. This information is stored for example in the database with reference number . Similarly when a representative of an organization initially registers the organization with the social network service the representative may be prompted to provide certain information about the organization. This information may be stored for example in the database with reference number or another database not shown . With some embodiments the profile data may be processed e.g. in the background or offline to generate various derived profile data. For example if a member has provided information about various job titles the member has held with the same company or different companies and for how long this information can be used to infer or derive a member profile attribute indicating the member s overall seniority level or seniority level within a particular company. With some embodiments importing or otherwise accessing data from one or more externally hosted data sources may enhance profile data for both members and organizations. For instance with companies in particular financial data may be imported from one or more external data sources and made part of a company s profile.

Once registered a member may invite other members or be invited by other members to connect via the social network service. A connection may require a bi lateral agreement by the members such that both members acknowledge the establishment of the connection. Similarly with some embodiments a member may elect to follow another member. In contrast to establishing a connection the concept of following another member typically is a unilateral operation and at least with some embodiments does not require acknowledgement or approval by the member that is being followed. When one member follows another the member who is following may receive status updates or other messages published by the member being followed or relating to various activities undertaken by the member being followed. Similarly when a member follows an organization the member becomes eligible to receive messages or status updates published on behalf of the organization. For instance messages or status updates published on behalf of an organization that a member is following will appear in the member s personalized data feed or content stream. In any case the various associations and relationships that the members establish with other members or with other entities and objects are stored and maintained within the social graph shown in with reference number .

The social network service may provide a broad range of other applications and services that allow members the opportunity to share and receive information often customized to the interests of the member. For example with some embodiments the social network service may include a photo sharing application that allows members to upload and share photos with other members. With some embodiments members may be able to self organize into groups or interest groups organized around a subject matter or topic of interest. With some embodiments the social network service may host various job listings providing details of job openings with various organizations.

As members interact with the various applications services and content made available via the social network service the members behavior e.g. content viewed links or member interest buttons selected etc. may be monitored and information concerning the member s activities and behavior may be stored for example as indicated in by the database with reference number . This information may be used to classify the member as being in various categories. For example if the member performs frequent searches of job listings thereby exhibiting behavior indicating that the member is a likely job seeker this information can be used to classify the member as a job seeker. This classification can then be used as a member profile attribute for purposes of enabling others to target the member for receiving messages or status updates. Accordingly a company that has available job openings can publish a message that is specifically directed to certain members of the social network service who are job seekers and thus more likely to be receptive to recruiting efforts.

With some embodiments the social network system includes what is generally referred to herein as a content selection system . The content feed selection system is described in more detail below in conjunction with .

Although not shown with some embodiments the social network system provides an application programming interface API module via which third party applications can access various services and data provided by the social network service. For example using an API a third party application may provide a user interface and logic that enables an authorized representative of an organization to publish messages from a third party application to a content hosting platform of the social network service that enables facilitates presentation of activity or content streams maintained and presented by the social network service. Such third party applications may be browser based applications or may be operating system specific. In particular some third party applications may reside and execute on one or more mobile devices e.g. phone or tablet computing devices having a mobile operating system.

According to various exemplary embodiments described in more detail below a content feed selection system is configured to scan or crawl a network such as the Internet in order to acquire various content accessible via the network e.g. webpages news items articles publications blog posts advertisements etc. and to ascribe various social attributes to that content describing users that have interacted with the content in various ways. For example in some embodiments the content feed selection system may ascribe social attributes to content on the webpages based on profile attributes of the users that are submitting social activity signals e.g. likes views comments shares follows clicks etc. in connection with the content.

For example with reference to the content selection system includes an identification module a social attribute module a content feed selection module and a database . The modules of the content feed selection system may be implemented on or executed by a single device such as a content selection device or on separate devices interconnected via a network. The aforementioned content selection device may be for example one of the client machines e.g. or application server s illustrated in .

The content items referred to herein may be any type of content item including online content items displayed in or accessible by a webpage or a user interface of a mobile application. Non limiting examples of content items include webpages news items blog posts articles publications presentations slideshows documents reviews pictures videos multimedia webpages rich media text video advertisements coupons promotions brochures items posted in a content stream or content feed notifications emails text or instant messages message boards bulletin boards forums profile pages e.g. profile pages on a social network service such as LinkedIn such as member profile pages influencer profile pages company profile pages group profile pages etc. and so on. In some embodiments the social activity signals may include views likes comments shares follows clicks conversions hover responses hide responses views of comments likes of comments shares of comments etc.

In some embodiments after the identification module acquires a piece of content such as an article posted on a webpage operation in the identification module may identify some or all of the users that have interacted with the content operation in by for example crawling or searching for social activity history information associated with the webpage. As described herein social activity history information may include any data or metadata describing social activity signals associated with content items. In some embodiments such social activity history information may be displayed on the crawled webpage itself e.g. the portions of the webpage that includes information summarizing the number of views likes shares comments etc. that the content has received as well as displaying the actual comments and the identity of users that are posting comments . In some embodiments if the content item is posted on a social network service e.g. posted on the LinkedIn Today section of the LinkedIn homepage the social network service may maintain social activity history information indicating how many views likes shares comments etc. each content item has received including social activity history information describing the substance of the comments associated with each of the content items. Such social activity history information may be stored locally at for example the database illustrated in or may be stored remotely at a database data repository storage server etc. that is accessible by the content promotion system via a network e.g. the Internet .

For example illustrates an example of the content item corresponding to an article describing the ACME corporation where the article includes various social activity signals including a number of views a number of likes a number of shares a number of comments and one or more comments . Moreover illustrates exemplary social activity history information and associated with the article illustrated in . The social activity history information describes a quantity of different social activity signals e.g. views likes shares comments etc. received by the article. Moreover the social activity history information describes the content of comments received by the article such as the identity of users that posted the comments the times when the comments were posted the substance of the comments contextual information about those comments e.g. the location of the user when they posted the comment as determined by IP address of the user s device or geo location information from the user s device or whether the comment was received from a mobile device or desktop device etc. . Although not illustrated in the identification module may access social activity history information that provides more detail with respect to other types of social activity signals such as information describing who liked the article and when who shared the article and when and so on.

After the identification module identifies the users that have interacted with the article operation in the social attribute module may access various types of profile attributes associated with these users operation in . For instance in some embodiments after the identification module identifies these users the social attribute module may access member profile information for these users if they are members of an online social network service such as LinkedIn Facebook or Twitter . For example if the social attribute module determines that the user John Smith has posted a comment on a particular article then the social attribute module may access the member profile page or member profile data for the user John Smith on the online social network service LinkedIn . Such member profile data of the member may specify member profile attributes including for example name location job title job experience seniority level employer employer size skills endorsements education gender age and so on.

Thereafter the social attribute module may associate the underlying content item with various social attribute information describing the member profile attributes of some or all the members that have interacted with the content operation in . The social attribute module may store such social attribute information in association with the underlying content item in a data structure e.g. a data table or record in a database as illustrated in . In some embodiments the social attribute information generated by the social attribute module may specifically indicate social attributes of the types of members that have interacted to a significant degree with the content. In other words the social attribute information may describe the types of users for which the content is trending e.g. see . For example the social attribute module may perform analysis on the social attributes and or a member profile attributes associated with each content item in order to determine whether that article is trending among various types of users. For example the social attribute module may determine that the article is trending among users having member profile attributes A B and C but not users having member profile attributes D E and F where such member profile attributes may correspond to any kinds of attributes e.g. location employer job title seniority level company size skills endorsements school and so on . For example the social attribute module may determine that a particular article is currently trending among engineers in the San Francisco Bay area who have been endorsed for the skills of Java and C whereas this particular article is not trending among artists located in New York City that have the skills of painting and interpretive dance . As a result the social attribute module may store information identifying a particular content item e.g. a link to an article or the actual content of the article itself in association with various social attributes describing the types of users that are consuming this content e.g. social attributes indicating that this article is trending among lawyers that went to Michigan or engineers that work at LinkedIn see .

According to various exemplary embodiments the identification module accesses or generate the social activity history information associated with content items as described above in conjunction with in various ways depending on whether the underlying content item posted on an online social network service e.g. LinkedIn associated with the content feed selection system or a 3party website.

For example according to various embodiments described above the content items acquired or accessed by the identification module may have previously been posted on an online social network service such as LinkedIn which may be associated with the system see and in . Accordingly the identification module may directly access social activity history information maintained by the online social network service that describes the members of the online social network service that have interacted with this posted content. Thus the identification module may identify the members that submitted the social activity signals based on this social activity history information associated with the content item that is maintained by the online social network service.

In other embodiments the content item may be previously posted on a website distinct from the online social network service. Thus the identification module may access these content items from external sources such as third party websites or third party online social network services. For example the identification module may crawl a network e.g. the Internet for content items such as articles publications news items blog posts responses posted on forums billboards question and answer services and so on. In some embodiments the identification module may identify the content items by crawling a set known third party sources or websites that are known for hosting content items such as websites associated with news organizations companies important individuals forums billboards question and answer services blogs and bloggers journals clubs and so on. In some embodiments the identification module may also access content items from other social network services.

If the content item is hosted by a third party then the identification module may crawl the information included in the content item in order to extract the aforementioned social activity history information see . For example the identification module may store a list of social activity keyword such as view s like s share s comment s and if the identification module detects these words and adjacent numbers in a content item the identification module may infer that this information represents social activity history information that indicates a number of views likes shares comments etc. the content item has received. Similarly by crawling webpages associated with content items the identification module may identify one or more comments posted in response to the content item e.g. such comments are typically displayed at a lower portion of the content item below the words comments . Accordingly the identification module may generate social activity history information e.g. see describing social activity signals associated with a particular content item hosted a third party website. The identification module may store such social activity history information in a database. Accordingly the identification module may identify the members that submitted the social activity signals to this content item by crawling the content item for social activity history information that describes social activity signals submitted by users in connection with the content item and identifying members of the social network service having names that match the users.

In some embodiments when the identification module accesses the content item from a third party website the system may transmit a request to the third party website for interaction information describing users that have interacted with or submitted social activity signals in conjunction with various content items. For example if the content feed selection system is associated with the online social network service LinkedIn and the identification module accesses and article posted on the webpage of the New York Times the system may transmit a request to the New York Times website e.g. via one or more application programming interfaces APIs associated with the New York Times website for information describing the names of members that have liked the article viewed the article shared the article e mailed the article and so on. Thereafter the identification module may look for the names of these users among the member base of the online social network service itself and may then access the member profile attributes of these members and associate these attributes with the New York Times article consistent with various embodiments described above.

In some embodiments after the identification module identifies the users that have interacted with the content item the social attribute module may access attributes of these users from other third party sources as opposed to their member profile attributes on an online social network service such as LinkedIn . For example the social attribute module may perform a network search of the Internet based on usernames and may crawl the results in order to identify profile pages biography pages articles etc. that are associated with these names. Thus the social attribute module may identify that for example the user having the name John Smith likely corresponds to a user John Smith described in a lawyer biography page of a law firm website. Thus the social attribute module may crawl various profile attributes from the lawyer profile page such as name location contact information seniority level job title experience areas of specialty skills endorsements awards publications and so on. As another example the social attribute module may identify that the user is and inventor on a patent posted on a webpage of the United States Patent and Trademark Office and thus the social attribute module may infer that the user has experience in one or more fields associated with information described in the patent. In some embodiments the social attribute module may identify articles publications presentations etc. authored by the user and may thus infer that the user has experience skills or endorsements associated with content areas fields or topics described in the underlying articles publications etc. Accordingly various exemplary embodiments the social attribute module may infer that the user has skills in the topic X if the content they authored describes information related to topic X. In some embodiments if the content authored by the user is a publication article slideshow etc. that has received a statistically significant number of comments having positive sentiment or a statistically significant number of social activity signals such as likes shares follows and so on then the social attribute module may treat classify this user as being endorsed for skills in the relevant topic of the content authored by the user. According to various exemplary embodiments if the user has authored an article or publication that has been cited by other articles or publications then the social attribute module may classify this user as being endorsed for skills in the relevant topic of the article or publication authored by the user.

According to various exemplary embodiments the identification module may identify whether content items are trending among particular kinds of users by analyzing the social activity history information associated with content items where the social activity history information may indicate users that publicly submitted various social activity signals. For example if the article in is posted on a social network service such as LinkedIn then each of the social activity signals will be received from other existing members of the social network service such as John Smith Jane Doe etc as identified in the comments likes shares etc. Accordingly after accessing social activity history information associated with a content item the social attribute module may access information associated with each of the members of the social network service that publicly submitted these social activity signals in order to determine the member profile attributes of these members. For example since one of the comments to the article was received from the user Jane Doe the social attribute module may access member profile data associated with a member profile of the user Jane Doe. For example illustrates an example of member profile data and associated with a user Jane Doe that is maintained by social network service such as LinkedIn where the member profile data and includes information such as name age gender location contact information e.g. phone number e mail address screen name etc. information regarding experience and educational positions of the member e.g. job position title employer term of employment degree educational institutions skills etc. and so on. The member profile data illustrated in is merely exemplary and the member profile data may include other information such as groups followed educational institutions followed companies followed influencers followed and social activity signals associated with the member e.g. content items viewed liked shared commented on substance of comments etc. and so on.

Accordingly based on the member profile data of the members that have generated social activity signals associated with the article the social attribute module may identify what type of people have viewed the article liked the article shared the article commented on the article and so on. Based on this information the identification module may determine that the article is trending popular or viral with specific types of users e.g. user sharing specific member profile attributes . For example the social attribute module may determine that the article has at least a predetermined number or proportion of views likes shares clicks comments and or other social activity signals from users that went to school at Michigan or worked at LinkedIn or that the article has received at least a predetermined number or proportion of social activity signals during a predetermined time interval e.g. the last hour the last eight hours the last 24 hours the last two days etc. from users that went to school at Michigan or worked at LinkedIn and so on. In some embodiments the social attribute module may determine that a content item hosted by the third party website is trending by accessing the content item periodically e.g. at regular time intervals in order to track the increase in social activity signals e.g. views shares likes etc. received by the content item within a time interval e.g. the last hour the last eight hours the last 24 hours the last two days etc. .

Turning now to in accordance with various exemplary embodiments when the content feed selection module of the content feed selection system determines that a user has logged in into a website e.g. a website of the social network service LinkedIn and is viewing a content feed e.g. a content feed associated with an online social network service such as LinkedIn or Facebook the content feed selection module may analyze various member profile attributes of this logged in user such as the logged in user s location job seniority level company size skills endorsements education etc. If the logged in user is a member of the online social network service the content feed selection module may access member profile data and or a member profile page associated with this logged in user in order to identify the appropriate attributes of this logged in user. Thereafter the content feed selection module may access social attribute information describing various content items associated with various social attributes consistent with various embodiments described above and the content feed selection module may identify content items previously crawled from the Internet that are associated with the social attributes matching the member profile attributes of the visiting member. For example if the logged in user is a lawyer that went to Michigan University that lives in the Bay Area and that has been endorsed for the skills of criminal law and trial law then the content feed selection module may identify content items that are trending among users with similar social attributes e.g. content articles trending among users that are lawyers that attended Michigan and or that are endorsed for the skills of criminal law and trial lawyer .

Once the content feed selection module identifies content items ascribed to social attributes matching the member profile attributes of the logged in member the content feed selection module may adjust content in a content feed viewable by the logged in member accordingly. For example referring to the previous example described above the content feed selection module will display more content that was viewed by lawyers that attended Michigan that have the endorsements for criminal law and trial law and so on. In some embodiments the content feed selection module may instead or in addition hide content items not associated with social attributes matching the member profile attributes of the visiting member. In other words the content feed selection module will not display content items that are not trending among lawyers that attended Michigan and that have the endorsements of criminal law and trial law .

In some embodiments when the content feed selection module adjusts the display of content items in a content feed viewable by the logged in user the content feed selection module may include a note or label identifying why a particular content item is being included in the content feed. For example the system may display an article together with the caption that this article is currently trending among lawyers who attended Michigan and who have been endorsed for the skills of criminal law and trial law . Thus the note may indicate the various social attributes that have been ascribed to this content item and or may indicate that the specific content item has been disseminated by or is trending among members that are similar to the logged in member because they possess such attributes.

For example illustrates an exemplary content feed of a social network service e.g. LinkedIn that is displayed to a member of the social network service when they login to the social network service. The content feed includes status updates and news associated with other members of the social network service that are connected to the particular member. For example the content feed includes a status update indicating that a connection has an updated profile a status update indicating that a connection has shared an article a status update indicating that the skills of a connection were endorsed by others a status update indicating that a connection has begun following a company a status update indicating that a connection has new connections and so on. The content feed also includes a user interface element allowing the particular member to enter status updates and to share these status updates with other members of the social network service e.g. where the status updates are placed into the content feeds of other members connected to the particular member . A social network service such as LinkedIn also allows a member to access content associated with various interests by following a particular company an organization an educational institution e.g. school or university a particular influencer e.g. a very important or influential member of the social network service a particular group and so on. For example when a member follows a company an educational institution an influencer a group and so on information regarding each of these interests will be included in the content feed displayed to the member. For example suppose the member viewing the content feed in is following the companies Edison Motors Rich Industries and Oceanic Airlines . Accordingly the content feed includes various information e.g. posts shares news status updates etc. that relate to these companies such as posts and in the content feed . The content feed illustrated in is merely exemplary and may correspond to the main content feed displayed on the homepage of a social network service such as LinkedIn . However social network services such as LinkedIn may include other content feeds such as company content feeds associated with companies group content feeds associated with groups education content feeds associated with educational institutions influencer feeds associated with influencers member content feeds associated with members and so on. In some embodiments the content feed selection module may insert the specific content item itself into a content stream of the online social network service. For example illustrates a content feed similar to the content feed illustrated in where and update associated with the article has been inserted into the content feed . More specifically the update refers to the article and includes a reference link for accessing the article . The update also includes a note indicating that this comment is trending among computer scientists .

Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components modules or mechanisms. Modules may constitute either software modules e.g. code embodied 1 on a non transitory machine readable medium or 2 in a transmission signal or hardware implemented modules. A hardware implemented module is a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments one or more computer systems e.g. a standalone client or server computer system or one or more processors may be configured by software e.g. an application or application portion as a hardware implemented module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.

In various embodiments a hardware implemented module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example a hardware implemented module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured e.g. as a special purpose processor such as a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC to perform certain operations. A hardware implemented module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry e.g. as encompassed within a general purpose processor or other programmable processor that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware implemented module mechanically in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry or in temporarily configured circuitry e.g. configured by software may be driven by cost and time considerations.

Accordingly the term hardware implemented module should be understood to encompass a tangible entity be that an entity that is physically constructed permanently configured e.g. hardwired or temporarily or transitorily configured e.g. programmed to operate in a certain manner and or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware implemented modules are temporarily configured e.g. programmed each of the hardware implemented modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example where the hardware implemented modules comprise a general purpose processor configured using software the general purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware implemented modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor for example to constitute a particular hardware implemented module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware implemented module at a different instance of time.

Hardware implemented modules can provide information to and receive information from other hardware implemented modules. Accordingly the described hardware implemented modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware implemented modules exist contemporaneously communications may be achieved through signal transmission e.g. over appropriate circuits and buses that connect the hardware implemented modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware implemented modules are configured or instantiated at different times communications between such hardware implemented modules may be achieved for example through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware implemented modules have access. For example one hardware implemented module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware implemented module may then at a later time access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware implemented modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource e.g. a collection of information .

The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed at least partially by one or more processors that are temporarily configured e.g. by software or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured such processors may constitute processor implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may in some example embodiments comprise processor implemented modules.

Similarly the methods described herein may be at least partially processor implemented. For example at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or processors or processor implemented modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors not only residing within a single machine but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments the processor or processors may be located in a single location e.g. within a home environment an office environment or as a server farm while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.

The one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a cloud computing environment or as a software as a service SaaS . For example at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers as examples of machines including processors these operations being accessible via a network e.g. the Internet and via one or more appropriate interfaces e.g. Application Program Interfaces APIs . 

Example embodiments may be implemented in digital electronic circuitry or in computer hardware firmware software or in combinations of them. Example embodiments may be implemented using a computer program product e.g. a computer program tangibly embodied in an information carrier e.g. in a machine readable medium for execution by or to control the operation of data processing apparatus e.g. a programmable processor a computer or multiple computers.

A computer program can be written in any form of programming language including compiled or interpreted languages and it can be deployed in any form including as a stand alone program or as a module subroutine or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.

In example embodiments operations may be performed by one or more programmable processors executing a computer program to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. Method operations can also be performed by and apparatus of example embodiments may be implemented as special purpose logic circuitry e.g. a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC .

The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client server relationship to each other. In embodiments deploying a programmable computing system it will be appreciated that that both hardware and software architectures require consideration. Specifically it will be appreciated that the choice of whether to implement certain functionality in permanently configured hardware e.g. an ASIC in temporarily configured hardware e.g. a combination of software and a programmable processor or a combination of permanently and temporarily configured hardware may be a design choice. Below are set out hardware e.g. machine and software architectures that may be deployed in various example embodiments.

The example computer system includes a processor e.g. a central processing unit CPU a graphics processing unit GPU or both a main memory and a static memory which communicate with each other via a bus . The computer system may further include a video display unit e.g. a liquid crystal display LCD or a cathode ray tube CRT . The computer system also includes an alphanumeric input device e.g. a keyboard or a touch sensitive display screen a user interface UI navigation device e.g. a mouse a disk drive unit a signal generation device e.g. a speaker and a network interface device .

The disk drive unit includes a machine readable medium on which is stored one or more sets of instructions and data structures e.g. software embodying or utilized by any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein. The instructions may also reside completely or at least partially within the main memory and or within the processor during execution thereof by the computer system the main memory and the processor also constituting machine readable media.

While the machine readable medium is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium the term machine readable medium may include a single medium or multiple media e.g. a centralized or distributed database and or associated caches and servers that store the one or more instructions or data structures.
