The present invention relates to a secure picture generating device a secure picture displaying device and various methods which are used for securing a picture so it cannot be copied by a browser function or a screen snap shot when the picture is posted to an online social media site or elsewhere on the Internet.

Currently there are very few security methods that can be used to protect pictures let alone protect pictures which are posted to an online social media site or elsewhere on the Internet. For example people may store their pictures in encrypted files but generally when their pictures are posted to the online social media site or elsewhere on the Internet then their pictures are open to copying through a browser function or a screen snap shot. Thus even if a posted picture is subsequently taken off the Internet it could have already been copied by anyone while it was posted on the Internet. Consequently there is a need to address this problem and other problems so that a picture cannot be copied by a browser function or a screen snap shot while the picture is posted to an online social media site or elsewhere on the Internet.

A secure picture generating device a secure picture displaying device and various methods which address the aforementioned problem and other problems are described in the independent claims of the present application. Advantageous embodiments of the secure picture generating device the secure picture displaying device and the various methods have been described in the dependent claims of the present application.

Additional aspects of the invention will be set forth in part in the detailed description figures and any claims which follow and in part will be derived from the detailed description or can be learned by practice of the invention. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention as disclosed.

Referring to there is illustrated a basic diagram of a secure picture system comprising a secure picture generating device and a secure picture displaying device which are configured in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Basically the secure picture generating device operates to receive a picture e.g. Graphics Interchange Format GIF picture a Joint Photographic Experts Group JPEG picture or any other standard picture format and then generate and output a secure picture executable file . The secure picture displaying device which has a display and or is connected to remote display s operates to receive the secure picture executable file and then execute the secure picture executable file to display only a selected portion of the picture at any one time on the display remote display s such that the entire picture is perceivable by the human eye but an image copy of the display remote display s by a browser function or a screen snap shot at any given time will capture the displayed selected portion of the picture but will not capture the entire picture . It should be appreciated that the secure displaying device can have a display but this is not required instead the secure displaying device may be connected via Internet wireless connections etc. . . . to one or more remote display s .

A general discussion describing the secure picture generating device the secure picture executable file and the secure picture displaying device is provided next and then a more detailed discussion describing the secure picture generating device the secure picture executable file and the secure picture displaying device is provided with respect to B A and B to explain the different technical features and the advantages associated with the present invention.

The secure picture generating device receives a picture in the form of a GIF file a JPEG file or some other standard picture format. The secure picture generating device may also receive an optional password an optional time to play value in any time value such as days hours minutes or seconds an optional expiry date and time value and an optional encryption type .

The secure picture generating device segments the picture into a number of picture frames . . . and creates a number of picture fragment sets . . . . Each picture fragment set . . . is composed of a certain number of picture frames two or more which were selected from the set of picture frames . . . three or more . In particular each picture fragment set . . . holds a certain number of selected picture frames . . . two or more . And each picture fragment set . . . has their own selected set of picture frames which when taken together compose the entire picture . Typically each picture fragment set . . . would have their own distinct set different set of selected picture frames . . . . Alternatively the secure picture generating device can create the picture fragment sets . . . where for example one picture fragment set could be composed of x picture frames . . . where each picture frame holds only every xth horizontal line from the original picture . In particular a set of three picture frames with this kind of fragmentation would be such that the first frame would contain every 3horizontal line starting from line one the second frame would contain every 3horizontal line starting from line two and the third frame would contain every 3horizontal line starting from line three. Then the second set of picture fragments could contain x picture frames . . . where each picture frame only holds every xth vertical line from the original picture and so on. One skilled in the art will appreciate that based on these teachings there are a wide variety of ways that the secure picture generating device can create the picture fragment sets . . . by using segmented picture frames . . . from the original picture . It should be appreciated that the secure picture generating device need not generate the segmented picture frames . . . first and then generate the picture fragment sets . . . from the previously generated picture frames . . . but instead could create the picture fragment sets . . . at same time segmenting picture frames . . . from the original picture . In any case the secure picture displaying device as will be described in more detail below uses these picture fragment sets . . . and in particular their selected picture frames . . . to display animate the picture .

The secure picture generating device stores and if desired can encrypt the picture fragment sets . . . and other data including the optional password the optional time to play value the optional expiry date and time value within the secure picture executable file . Further the secure picture generating device adds animation code e.g. Application Programming Interface API animation code and a decryption key if encryption is used within the secure picture executable file . The animation code and the decryption key would typically not be encrypted. As will be described in more detail below the secure picture displaying device receives the secure picture executable file and would first prompt the user to input a password and check if the inputted password matches the stored password this step assumes the optional password is used . If the inputted password matches the stored password then the secure picture displaying device would then utilize the decryption key to decrypt the secure picture executable file assuming encryption was used and then execute the animation code to animate display the picture .

The secure picture executable file contains the picture data and code data. The picture data is typically encrypted and comprises the picture fragment sets . . . and other data including the optional password the optional time to play value and the optional expiry date and time value . The code data is not typically encrypted and comprises the animation code e.g. API code and the optional decryption key . The animation code comprises code instructions software for displaying animating the picture utilizing the picture fragment sets . . . . Basically the only way that the secure picture displaying device can display animate the picture utilizing the picture fragment sets . . . is through the animation code . Of course if one had the decryption key then they could decrypt the secure picture executable file and have access to the picture through the picture fragment sets . . . . Typically the secure picture generating device would only generate the decryption key if the optional encryption type is received and utilized. Alternatively the secure picture generating device need not receive the encryption type to use encryption instead the secure picture generating device could automatically use encryption to protect to the secure picture executable file . In any case the secure picture generating device would in most circumstances use encryption so that the picture fragment sets . . . could not easily be extracted from the secure picture executable file .

The animation code can be accessed through two non blocking API calls play and stop. The play call which activates the playing instructions comprises a file handle a window handle a position and the optional password . The secure picture executable file is first verified and then locked while executing the playing instructions . If the play is called when for example a valid password and play command are received from a user of the secure picture displaying device then the picture is decrypted assuming encryption was used and animated in the display remote display s recall the requirement of the password to start the playing instructions is optional . The playing instructions will repeatedly display the selected picture frames and for example from one picture fragment set for example over a predetermined time e.g. one second and then repeatedly display the selected picture frames and for example from another picture fragment set for example over a predetermined time e.g. one second and so on. If one attempted to copy the currently displayed picture through a browser function or a screen snap shot then the resulting image copy would only contain the displayed selected picture frame for example and more importantly not contain the entire picture . The only way to display the picture data . . . is through the API playing instructions .

If the optional time to play value is set then the secure picture displaying device decrements the time to play value every second or any desired time period and writes back the corresponding updated time to play value to the opened secure picture executable file . If the time to play value reaches zero or the optional expiry date and time value is reached then the picture fragment sets . . . and their corresponding picture frames . . . are cleared or otherwise deleted from the secure picture displaying device and the secure picture executable file . If this happens then the animation of the picture stops. If for some reason the opened secure picture executable file cannot be updated with the corresponding updated time to play value then the animation of the picture stops.

The stop call which activates the stopping instructions when activated for example by a user inputting a stop command into the secure picture displaying device would result in the stopping of the animation of the picture . In addition the receipt of the stop call which activates the stopping instructions results in the stopping of the decrementing of the time to play value . At this point in time the secure picture executable file would be closed and the secure picture would not be displayed animated .

The secure picture executable file may be copied but the optional password the optional time to play value and the optional expiry date and time value will also be part of the copied secure picture executable file .

The secure picture displaying device is configured to receive and store the secure picture executable file into memory. The secure picture displaying device is further configured to open a window to request the user to input a password if there is an optional password within the secure picture executable file and if the password requirement is satisfied and the user s presents a play command then the secure picture would be displayed animated . Generally the secure picture displaying device can be made e.g. instructed by user commands and to play or stop playing the secure picture . For instance the secure picture displaying device would prompt a user for a file path of the secure picture executable file and request a password which needs to be received and verified before being able to initiate the API playing instructions which may also require the receipt of a play command from the user in order to animate the secure picture . The API playing instructions is called with the file handle of the secure picture executable file the password and a window handle for displaying the secure picture . If the user inputs a stop command then the secure picture displaying device would stop the display animation of the secure picture .

The secure picture displaying device can be anyone of a wide variety of different types of devices that display a picture. For example the secure picture displaying device may be a computer such as smart phone laptop tablet etc. . . . that has a browser application that can receive and execute the secure picture executable file in order to animate the picture . Alternatively the secure picture displaying device may be a simple device which has a single task application that would only be used for receiving and executing the secure picture executable file to animate the picture . This simple device could be similar to a specialized application that only displays GIF or JPEG pictures and would not require the input of a password play command or stop command . Alternatively the secure picture generating device and the secure picture displaying device may be incorporated onto a user s computer smart phone laptop tablet etc. such that the user may download take a picture and then upload post or otherwise display animate the picture to an online social media site or elsewhere on the Internet.

In addition the animation code comprises stopping instructions which when executed stop the playing of the picture fragments sets . . . . Furthermore the animation code may comprise password verifying instructions which when executed request a password from the user of the secure picture displaying device and verifies the received password to the stored password before implementing the playing instructions . If desired the animation code may comprise 1 decrementing instructions which when executed reduce the time to play value within the secure picture executable file by a predetermined amount when a predetermined amount of time has passed during which the playing instructions are being implemented and 2 deleting instructions which when the time to play value has been completely decremented function to delete the picture fragment sets . . . within the secure picture executable file . The animation code may also comprise deleting instructions which when executed keep track of the current date and time and upon reaching the expiry date and time value functions to delete the picture fragment sets . . . within the secure picture executable file .

In the outputting operation the secure picture generating device outputs the secure picture executable file see FIG. B s outputting operation . In general the secure picture generating device outputs the secure picture executable file to the secure picture displaying device . It should be appreciated that the secure picture generating device and the secure picture displaying device would normally be separate and distinct devices but they could also be if desired the same device.

Referring to there are respectively illustrated a diagram of an exemplary secure picture displaying device and a flowchart of a method implemented by the secure picture displaying device for displaying the picture in a secure manner in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in the secure picture displaying device comprises an input interface an optional user interface an optional display a processor a memory and an optional output interface . The secure picture displaying device may incorporate many other well known components but for clarity only those components and which are needed to describe the features of the present invention are discussed and shown herein.

The animation code may also comprise deleting instructions which when executed keep track of the current date and time and upon reaching the expiry date and time value functions to delete the picture fragment sets . . . within the secure picture executable file .

In the playing operation the secure picture displaying device executes the playing instructions such that the picture is perceivable to the human eye on the display remote display s but an image copy of the display remote display s at any given time will capture the displayed selected picture frame for example but will not capture the entire picture see FIG. B s playing operation note the output interface would be used to enable the display animation of the picture at the remote display s . In one example the secure picture displaying device would receive the play command if required in the first place from the user via the user interface or input interface and then execute the playing instructions to play the picture fragment sets . . . in a sequence one after another wherein each picture fragment set . . . would be played such that their respective selected picture frames . . . are individually displayed one after another in a repeatable manner during a predetermined time period e.g. one second periods note the user can directly interface with the secure picture displaying device or they can use their own device which would have a remote display to interface with the secure picture displaying device . In the illustrated example the secure picture displaying device would execute the playing instructions and repeatedly play the selected picture frames and from the first picture fragment set over a predetermined time e.g. one second and then repeatedly play the second selected picture frames and from second picture fragment set over a predetermined time e.g. one second . Hence the first picture fragment set would be played for a predetermined time e.g. one second then the second picture fragment set would be played for a predetermined time e.g. one second and then the first picture fragment set would be played for a predetermined time e.g. one second and so on. If one attempted to copy the displayed picture through a browser function or a screen snap shot then the resulting image copy would only contain the displayed selected picture frame for example and more importantly not contain the entire picture .

In the stopping operation the secure picture displaying device executes the stopping instructions to stop the displaying or animation of the picture see FIG. B s stopping operation . In one example the secure picture displaying device would receive the stop command if required in the first place from the user via the user interface or the input interface and then execute the stopping instructions to stop of the displaying of picture fragments sets . . .

In the password verification operation optional the secure picture displaying device executes the verifying instructions to request a password from the user of the secure picture displaying device and verifies the received password to the stored password before implementing the playing instructions see FIG. B s password verification operation . Typically the verification operation would only be performed if the secure picture executable file has the password stored therein. In other words the secure picture executable file would not have the verifying instructions in the first place if there was no password .

In the time to play value decrementing and picture fragment sets deleting operations optional the secure picture displaying device executes 1 the decrementing instructions to reduce the time to play value within the secure picture executable file by a predetermined amount when a predetermined amount of time has passed during which the playing instructions are being implemented and 2 the deleting instructions to delete the picture fragment sets . . . within the secure picture executable file when the time to play value has been completely decremented see FIG. B s decrementing deleting operation . Typically the secure picture executable file would not have the determining instructions and the deleting instructions in the first place if there was no time to play value .

In the expiry date checking and picture fragment sets deleting operations optional the secure picture displaying device executes deleting instructions to keep track of the current date and time and upon reaching the expiry date and time value deletes the picture fragment sets . . . within the secure picture executable file .
