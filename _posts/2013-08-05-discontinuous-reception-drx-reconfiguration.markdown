abstract: Technology for communicating a discontinuous reception (DRX) reconfiguration is disclosed. In one method, a preferred power consumption configuration message is received, at an evolved node B (eNB) from a user equipment. The preferred power consumption configuration message may be a one-bit message using a first Boolean value to indicate a preferred power consumption configuration. A DRX reconfiguration request message may be received, from the UE, to reconfigure a DRX configuration of the UE to reduce a power consumption level of the UE. The DRX reconfiguration request message may be the one-bit message using a second Boolean value to indicate a DRX reconfiguration. The eNB may determine to reconfigure the DRX configuration of the UE based on the DRX reconfiguration request message. In addition, the eNB may perform the DRX reconfiguration at the UE by adjusting one or more parameters of the DRX configuration.

The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 679 627 filed Aug. 3 2012 the entire specification of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

Wireless mobile communication technology uses various standards and protocols to transmit data between a node e.g. a transmission station and a wireless device e.g. a mobile device . Some wireless devices communicate using orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA in a downlink DL transmission and single carrier frequency division multiple access SC FDMA in an uplink UL transmission. Standards and protocols that use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM for signal transmission include the Third Generation Partnership Project 3GPP Long Term Evolution LTE the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 802.16 standard e.g. 802.16e 802.16m which is commonly known to industry groups as WiMAX Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access and the IEEE 802.11 standard which is commonly known to industry groups as WiFi.

In 3GPP radio access network RAN LTE systems the node can be a combination of Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network E UTRAN Node Bs also commonly denoted as evolved Node Bs enhanced Node Bs eNodeBs or eNBs and Radio Network Controllers RNCs which communicates with the wireless device known as a user equipment UE . The downlink DL transmission can be a communication from the node e.g. eNodeB to the wireless device e.g. UE and the uplink UL transmission can be a communication from the wireless device to the node.

Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.

Before the present invention is disclosed and described it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures process steps or materials disclosed herein but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting.

As used herein the term substantially refers to the complete or nearly complete extent or degree of an action characteristic property state structure item or result. For example an object that is substantially enclosed would mean that the object is either completely enclosed or nearly completely enclosed. The exact allowable degree of deviation from absolute completeness may in some cases depend on the specific context. However generally speaking the nearness of completion will be so as to have the same overall result as if absolute and total completion were obtained. The use of substantially is equally applicable when used in a negative connotation to refer to the complete or near complete lack of an action characteristic property state structure item or result.

An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. The following definitions are provided for clarity of the overview and embodiments described below.

In a wireless wide area network WWAN such as the Third Generation Partnership Project 3GPP Long Term Evolution LTE network Release 8 the concept of discontinuous reception DRX was introduced for saving power. DRX can be used to enable a wireless device such as a user equipment UE in a 3GPP LTE network to discontinuously monitor a control channel such as the physical downlink control channel PDCCH communicated from a transmission station such as an enhanced NodeB eNodeB . The discontinuous monitoring can provide significant power savings at the UE since the receiver at the UE can be turned off.

In one example a WWAN transceiver in a wireless device can communicate with a transmission station referred to as a network node to negotiate time periods in which the wireless device will receive communications from the network node. During the negotiated times when information is not received the wireless device can turn its receiver off and enter a low power state. Discontinuous reception is used in a number of different wireless communication standards including but not limited to 3GPP LTE Rel. 8 9 10 11 and 12 and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 802.11 standard.

In the 3GPP LTE standard a set of functionalities are provided to enable an LTE configured receiver in a UE to perform sleep events. These sleep events may last anywhere from a single millisecond to hundreds of milliseconds or longer. The duration and timing of the sleep events can be negotiated between the UE and the network node. The negotiation may be performed using high level signaling such as an Open Systems Interconnection OSI level 3 communication or another type of high level signaling. One example of an OSI level 3 communication in the 3GPP LTE standard is radio resource control RRC signaling. In the LTE standard RRC signaling is used to control DRX operations at the LTE configured transceiver in the UE.

A brief description of the frame structure of the 3GPP LTE standard is provided herein as a reference. illustrates a downlink radio frame structure type 2. In the example a radio frame of a signal used to transmit the data can be configured to have a duration T of 10 milliseconds ms . Each radio frame can be segmented or divided into ten subframes that are each 1 ms long. Each subframe can be further subdivided into two slots and each with a duration T of 0.5 ms. Each slot for a component carrier CC used by the transmitting station and the receiving station can include multiple resource blocks RBs and based on the CC frequency bandwidth. The CC can have a carrier frequency having a bandwidth and center frequency. Each RB physical RB or PRB can include 12 15 kHz subcarriers on the frequency axis and or orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM symbols on the time axis per subcarrier. The RB can use seven OFDM symbols if a short or normal cyclic prefix is employed. The RB can use six OFDM symbols if an extended cyclic prefix is used. The resource block can be mapped to 84 resource elements REs using short or normal cyclic prefixing or the resource block can be mapped to 72 REs not shown using extended cyclic prefixing. The RE can be a unit of one OFDM symbol by one subcarrier i.e. 15 kHz . Each RE can transmit two bits and of information in the case of quadrature phase shift keying QPSK modulation. Other types of modulation may be used such as 16 quadrature amplitude modulation QAM or 64 QAM to transmit a greater number of bits in each RE or bi phase shift keying BPSK modulation to transmit a lesser number of bits a single bit in each RE. The RB can be configured for a downlink transmission from the eNodeB to the UE or the RB can be configured for an uplink transmission from the UE to the eNodeB.

The network node in the 3GPP LTE standard is a node with which the UE has set up at least one component carrier. The network node may be a full power eNodeB referred to as a macro node. Alternatively the UE may be in communication with a low power node such as a femto node pico node or home eNodeB HeNB . The UE may also communicate with a macro node or low power node via a relay node.

A UE can be set in either an RRC IDLE or an RRC CONNECTED state to extend battery life while still guaranteeing a high quality of service QoS and connectivity speed. The 3GPP LTE implementation allows the UE to reduce the amount of time spent monitoring a control channel such as the PDCCH for control channel information. Rather than monitoring the PDCCH every transmission time interval TTI the UE can monitor the PDCCH only during specific time intervals set through the RRC communication. An Active Time is a time related to DRX operation during which the UE monitors the PDCCH in PDCCH subframes. This solution can provide benefits in both the downlink and uplink because all of the scheduling control information is transmitted on the PDCCH. During non active states the UE can be configured to enter a power saving state that can significantly decrease the power consumption of the LTE configured radio frequency modem at the UE thereby reducing interference at collocated radios at the UE.

The RRC signaling can be used to manage the use of DRX by setting various parameters. Examples of parameters that can be set in the RRC CONNECTED state are illustrated in the following table.

When the network configures DRX for a UE a value is defined for the DRX Inactivity Timer referred to in the 3GPP LTE Technical Specification TS 36.321 as a drx Inactivity Timer that starts running after each data block has been sent. If new data is sent then the timer is restarted. If still no data is sent when the timer expires then the device can enter a DRX mode with a short DRX cycle. This means that the UE will effectively sleep and awake in a relatively short pattern based on the short DRX cycle. If new data is received then it can be received relatively quickly since the UE only sleeps for short periods. The short DRX cycle mode also has a configurable short DRX cycle timer i.e. drxShortCycleTimer attached. Once this timer expires i.e. no data is received during the short cycle mode the UE can enter the long DRX cycle. The long DRX cycle can further reduce power usage but also increases latency time.

During the inactivity periods the UE may only check the control channels and resources may be assigned. In each DRX cycle short and long the RF modem can be turned on for a number of consecutive subframes set by the On Duration timer to listen to the control channel. When data activity is detected in either the downlink or uplink the eNodeB triggers the short DRX cycle for the UE thereby increasing the responsiveness and connectivity of the UE. The transitions between the Long DRX Cycle and the Short DRC cycle may be triggered directly by the eNodeB or determined by a timer. Control channel information received on the PDCCH can identify resource blocks in which data is communicated to the UE thereby enabling the UE to receive the data transmitted in the downlink.

The inactivity timer can specify the consecutive number of TTIs during which the UE will monitor the PDCCH after successfully decoding a PDCCH indicating an uplink or a downlink data transfer for the UE. The inactivity timer can keep the UE awake for a certain period during data transfer even if the on duration timer has expired. In a downlink the inactivity timer is usually triggered within an on duration period. If the on duration period is longer the inactivity timer may start and expire within the awake period. In this example the inactivity timer will not contribute to the average awake time of the terminal. The inactivity timer may only be triggered for new transmissions in both an uplink and downlink and not for retransmissions.

Another DRX feature is related to power saving during HARQ retransmissions. For example when a UE fails to decode a transport block of a HARQ active process the UE assumes that the next retransmission will take place after a DRX retransmission timer. This allows the UE to enter a power saving state without the need to listen to the PDCCH.

In the 3GPP LTE specification a HARQ round trip time RTT timer can be started after 1 ms for decoding delay of the PDCCH indicating a downlink shared channel PDSCH transmission. The HARQ RTT timer can be started for every downlink shared channel transmission.

In 3GPP Release 11 enhancements for diverse data applications eDDA are related to improving power efficiency of device and signaling overhead over an air interface while supporting diverse data applications in LTE. In one example the UE may communicate a power preference indication PPI to an evolved node B eNB . The PPI may be one bit UE assistance information that improves the UE s power efficiency in the context of background traffic. In other words the UE may communicate its preferred power consumption configuration i.e. PPI information to the eNB. The preferred power consumption configuration of the UE may be a default power consumption configuration or a lower power consumption configuration. The default power configuration may represent a preferred UE power configuration that is optimized for active traffic such as delay sensitive applications. An active traffic session may include a time period when a user is actively interacting with the UE. The lower power consumption configuration may represent a preferred UE power configuration that is optimized for device power saving and is suitable for background traffic. A background traffic session may represent the duration when the user is not directly interacting with the UE. During the background traffic session applications may run in the background and generate updates notifications etc.

In response to the UE communicating the preferred power consumption configuration to the eNB the eNB may set or establish the UE s power consumption configuration. In one example the UE may not communicate the same preferred power consumption configuration as previously communicated to the eNB until expiry of a timer e.g. T340 . In other words after expiry of the timer the UE may communicate the same preferred power consumption configuration as previously communicated to the eNB.

The DRX configuration of the UE may depend on whether the UE is operating in the default power consumption configuration or the lower power consumption configuration. For example the UE may request a default DRX configuration from the eNB when operating in the default power consumption configuration. Similarly the UE may request a lower power DRX configuration from the eNB when operating in the lower power consumption configuration. In one example the eNB may grant the UE s request to transition into the default DRX configuration or the lower power DRX configuration.

The DRX configuration may include various parameters such as an inactivity timer ON duration short cycle long cycle number of consecutive short cycles before entering a long cycle etc. The DRX configuration parameters may determine the amount of power saving that the UE may achieve.

In one example the low power DRX configuration may include a shorter inactivity timer a smaller number of short DRX cycle repetitions before the long DRX cycle starts and longer long DRX cycles. As a result the UE may transition into a DRX sleep mode quicker and for a longer period of time thereby saving UE battery life. When data packets arrive at the eNB while the UE is in the DRX sleep mode the data packets may be buffered until the UE is awake. In addition the DRX buffering that results from the longer DRX cycles may lead to increased end to end packet delay.

The default DRX configuration may reduce the degradation of delay performance that may occur when the UE uses the lower power DRX configuration. For example the default DRX configuration may include a longer inactivity timer i.e. to send the UE into the DRX sleep mode less often a higher number of short DRX cycle repetitions i.e. to keep the UE in light sleep more frequently and a shorter length of long DRX cycles i.e. to reduce the maximum buffering delay when the UE is asleep . The default DRX configurations may save less power as compared to the lower power DRX configuration.

In one configuration signaling from the UE to the network may allow the UE to toggle between a default power consumption configuration and a lower power consumption configuration. In other words the UE may communicate a one bit message to the eNB to toggle i.e. switch between the default power consumption configuration and the lower power consumption configuration. The one bit message may include two possible Boolean values 0 and 1 . In one configuration the UE may communicate a Boolean value of 1 to toggle between the default power consumption configuration and the lower power consumption configuration. For example when the UE is operating in the default power consumption configuration the UE may communicate the Boolean value of 1 to switch to the lower power consumption configuration. As another example when the UE is operating in the lower power consumption configuration the UE may communicate the Boolean value of 1 to switch to the default power consumption configuration.

Although the one bit message communicated between the UE and the eNB contains two possible Boolean values i.e. 0 and 1 a single Boolean value i.e. the Boolean value of 1 may be used to toggle switch between the preferred power consumption configurations i.e. the default power consumption configuration and the lower power consumption configuration . Therefore the UE may use the unused Boolean value of the one bit message i.e. the Boolean value of 0 in this example to indicate a desired change in a DRX reconfiguration to the eNB. In other words the UE may harvest the unused Boolean value of the toggle bit e.g. the Boolean value of 0 to communicate the desired change in DRX configuration to the eNB. Thus a single bit can be used to both toggle between two different DRX settings as well as to communicate a desired change in a DRX configuration set by the eNB. In addition by the UE using the unused Boolean value of 0 in the one bit message to reconfigure the UE s DRX configuration the UE may achieve decreased battery power consumption and or increased quality of service QoS performance.

For example the UE may be using a default DRX configuration. The UE can communicate the Boolean value of 0 to the eNB in order to request the eNB to reconfigure the default DRX configuration with different DRX settings. For example the eNB may reconfigure the DRX with DRX settings that allow a faster response time and provide a better QoS. Alternatively when the Boolean value of 0 is received the eNB can be configured to reconfigure the DRX with DRX settings that provide greater battery life to the UE.

As another example the UE may be using a lower power DRX configuration. The UE may communicate the Boolean value of 0 to the eNB to request the eNB to reconfigure the lower power DRX configuration. The UE may determine that a reconfiguration is needed to resolve increased battery power consumption and or a decreased quality of service QoS performance. As a result the UE may communicate the desire to reconfigure its DRX configuration to the eNB.

In one configuration the UE may determine a desired power consumption level. For example the UE may determine an increased level of battery power consumption and or a decreased quality of service QoS performance is desired. The desired power consumption level may be a reduced power consumption level of the UE. Therefore the UE may determine to reconfigure its DRX configuration in order to achieve the reduced power consumption level.

The UE may communicate a DRX reconfiguration request message to the eNB. In one example the DRX reconfiguration request message may be the one bit message that includes a Boolean value of 0 to indicate the DRX reconfiguration. The UE may communicate the Boolean value of 0 to request the eNB to reconfigure the UE s default DRX configuration. In addition the UE may communicate the Boolean value of 0 to request the eNB to reconfigure the UE s lower power DRX configuration. The UE may communicate the Boolean value of 0 to the eNB using the UE assistance information message. As previously discussed the reconfiguration of the UE s default DRX configuration or the lower power DRX configuration may reduce the power consumption level of the UE.

The eNB may receive the DRX reconfiguration request message from the UE. The eNB may determine to reconfigure the UE s DRX configuration by adjusting at least one of an inactivity timer ON duration short cycle long cycle and a number of consecutive short cycles.

Alternatively the eNB may determine to not reconfigure the UE s DRX configuration. In one example the eNB may reconfigure the UE s lower power DRX configuration by decreasing an activity timer decreasing a number of short cycle repetitions before the long cycle starts and or increasing the length of a long cycle e.g. increasing the long cycle from sf80 to sf320 . In another example the eNB may reconfigure the UE s default DRX configuration by increasing an inactivity timer increasing a number of short cycle repetitions and or decreasing the length of the long cycle. Therefore when reconfiguring the default DRX configuration the eNB may change the short DRX cycle value from a value such as sf2 to a value such as sf10. The example values are not intended to be limiting.

The eNB may reconfigure the DRX configuration and then communicate a Radio Resource Connection RRC reconfiguration message to the UE. The RRC reconfiguration message may contain a request to reinitialize or restart the UE s DRX configuration. In other words the request to reinitialize or restart the DRX configuration may indicate to the UE that the eNB reconfigured the UE s DRX configuration. In response to the request to reinitialize the DRX configuration the UE may reinitialize the DRX configuration. As a result the UE may use the reconfigured DRX parameters e.g. decreased activity timer increased length of long cycle to provide the reduced power consumption level.

In one configuration the UE may communicate consecutive 0 s to the eNB to reconfigure the UE s DRX configuration. For example the UE may communicate a first 0 to reconfigure its lower power DRX configuration and then subsequently communicate a second 0 to further reconfigure the lower power DRX configuration. This can allow the UE to use the Boolean value to continually request a lower power or higher power DRX setting to provide lower battery power consumption or better QoS performance until the eNB communicates a DRX setting that is sufficient. However in one embodiment the UE may not communicate a second 0 to the eNB until expiry of a timer e.g. timer T340 . When the timer has expired the UE may communicate the second 0 to the eNB. In one example the eNB may limit the number of DRX reconfiguration request messages communicated from the UE to the eNB. For example the eNB may disable the UE s ability to communicate DRX reconfiguration request messages after the UE communicates a defined number of DRX reconfiguration request messages to the eNB.

The eNB may receive a DRX reconfiguration request message i.e. the Boolean value of 0 from the UE . The eNB may determine whether to grant the UE s request for the DRX reconfiguration. In one example the eNB may determine to not reconfigure the UE s DRX configuration. Alternatively the eNB may determine to reconfigure the default DRX configuration or the lower power DRX configuration depending on the DRX configuration of the UE when the UE communicated the Boolean value of 0 to the eNB .

The eNB may reconfigure the UE s DRX configuration by adjusting at least one of an inactivity timer ON duration short cycle long cycle and a number of consecutive short cycles. For example a reconfiguration of the UE s default DRX configuration may result in a longer inactivity timer a higher number of short cycle repetitions and a shorter length of long cycles. In addition a reconfiguration of the UE s lower power DRX configuration may result in a shorter inactivity timer a smaller number of short DRX cycle repetitions before the long DRX cycle starts and longer long DRX cycles. The eNB can be configured to know whether the received Boolean value is to increase or decrease the UE s power consumption or to increase the QoS.

The eNB may request the UE to restart or reinitialize the DRX configuration either the default DRX configuration or the lower power default DRX configuration using a Radio Resource Connection RRC Reconfiguration message. In other words the UE may determine that the eNB reconfigured the UE s DRX configuration upon receiving the request to reinitialize the DRX configuration from the eNB .

In one example after the UE communicates the Boolean value of 0 to the eNB the UE may remain in its present DRX configuration until the request to reinitialize the DRX configuration is received from the eNB . Thereafter the UE may restart or reinitialize its previous DRX configuration in order to operate in the DRX reconfiguration.

Another example provides functionality of computer circuitry of a user equipment UE operable to communicate a discontinuous reception DRX reconfiguration as shown in the flow chart in . The functionality may be implemented as a method or the functionality may be executed as instructions on a machine where the instructions are included on at least one computer readable medium or one non transitory machine readable storage medium. The computer circuitry can be configured to send to a node a preferred power consumption configuration message the preferred power consumption configuration message being a one bit message using a first Boolean value to indicate a preferred power consumption configuration as in block . The computer circuitry can be further configured to determine at the UE a desired power consumption level relative to a power level of the preferred power consumption configuration as in block . The computer circuitry may be also configured to communicate to the node a DRX reconfiguration request message to reconfigure a DRX configuration of the UE to provide a reduced power consumption level the DRX reconfiguration request message being the one bit message using a second Boolean value to indicate a DRX reconfiguration as in block .

In one example the computer circuitry can be further configured to receive from the node a Radio Resource Connection RRC reconfiguration message containing a request to reinitialize the DRX configuration the request indicating that the eNB reconfigured the DRX configuration of the UE. In addition the computer circuitry can be further configured to send the preferred power consumption configuration message to toggle between a default power consumption configuration and a lower power consumption configuration.

In one configuration the computer circuitry can be further configured to send the preferred power consumption configuration message to the node in a UE assistance information message. In one example the first Boolean value to indicate the preferred power consumption configuration is 1 and the second Boolean value to indicate the DRX reconfiguration is 0 . In addition the computer circuitry can be further configured to communicate the DRX reconfiguration request message to the node to reconfigure a default DRX configuration of the UE. Furthermore the computer circuitry can be configured to communicate the DRX reconfiguration request message to the node to reconfigure a lower power DRX configuration of the UE.

In one example the DRX configuration is reconfigured at the UE by adjusting at least one of an inactivity timer ON duration short cycle long cycle and a number of consecutive short cycles. In addition the UE includes an antenna a touch sensitive display screen a speaker a microphone a graphics processor an application processor internal memory or a non volatile memory port. Furthermore the node can be selected from a group consisting of a base station BS a Node B NB an evolved Node B eNB a baseband unit BBU a remote radio head RRH a remote radio equipment RRE or a remote radio unit RRU .

Another example provides a method for communicating a discontinuous reception DRX reconfiguration as shown in the flow chart in . The method may be executed as instructions on a machine where the instructions are included on at least one computer readable medium or one non transitory machine readable storage medium. The method includes the operation of receiving at an evolved node B eNB from a user equipment UE a preferred power consumption configuration message the preferred power consumption configuration message being a one bit message using a first Boolean value to indicate a preferred power consumption configuration as in block . The method further includes receiving from the UE a DRX reconfiguration request message to reconfigure a DRX configuration of the UE to reduce a power consumption level of the UE the DRX reconfiguration request message being the one bit message using a second Boolean value to indicate a DRX reconfiguration as in block . The method also includes determining at the eNB to reconfigure the DRX configuration of the UE based on the DRX reconfiguration request message as in block . In addition the method includes performing the DRX reconfiguration at the UE by adjusting one or more parameters of the DRX configuration as in block .

In one configuration the method can include communicating to the UE a Radio Resource Connection RRC reconfiguration message containing a request for the UE to reinitialize the DRX reconfiguration. In addition the method can include receiving the preferred power consumption configuration message to toggle between a default power consumption configuration and a lower power consumption configuration. Furthermore the method can include receiving the preferred power consumption configuration message from the UE in a UE assistance information message. In one example the first Boolean value to indicate the preferred power consumption configuration is 1 and the second Boolean value to indicate the DRX configuration is 0 .

In one configuration the method can include receiving the DRX reconfiguration request message from the UE to reconfigure a default DRX configuration of the UE. In addition the method can include receiving the DRX reconfiguration request message from the UE to reconfigure a lower power DRX configuration of the UE. Furthermore the method can include performing the DRX reconfiguration at the UE by adjusting at least one of an inactivity timer ON duration short cycle long cycle and a number of consecutive short cycles.

In one configuration the preferred power consumption configuration module can be further configured to send the preferred power consumption configuration message to toggle between a default power consumption configuration and a lower power consumption configuration. In one example the first Boolean value to indicate the preferred power consumption configuration is 1 and the second Boolean value to indicate the DRX reconfiguration is 0 . In addition the DRX reconfiguration module can be further configured to communicate the DRX reconfiguration message to the eNB to reconfigure at least one of a default DRX configuration or a lower power DRX configuration. In one example the wireless device is one of a user equipment UE and a mobile station MS having an antenna a touch sensitive display screen a speaker a microphone a graphics processor an application processor internal memory or a non volatile memory port.

Various techniques or certain aspects or portions thereof may take the form of program code i.e. instructions embodied in tangible media such as floppy diskettes CD ROMs hard drives non transitory computer readable storage medium or any other machine readable storage medium wherein when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine such as a computer the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the various techniques.

A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays programmable array logic programmable logic devices or the like.

Modules may also be implemented in software for execution by various types of processors. An identified module of executable code may for instance comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions which may for instance be organized as an object procedure or function. Nevertheless the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which when joined logically together comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module.

Indeed a module of executable code may be a single instruction or many instructions and may even be distributed over several different code segments among different programs and across several memory devices. Similarly operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure.
