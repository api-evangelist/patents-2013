This patent application claims the benefit and priority to Provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 61 829 875 titled Resource Management Based On Biometric Data filed on May 31 2013 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.

Some local and remote computing resources are protected with passwords and or personal identification numbers PINs such as operating systems online accounts files and password lockers. To be effective passwords typically need to be complex. However typing a complex password on many popular devices such as touch devices is cumbersome and often results in errors. Out of frustration users may resort to using short simple passwords that don t provide adequate security. PIN values tend to be short and users often reuse the same PIN in multiple settings making them vulnerable to brute force attacks or guessing. Both PINs and passwords are vulnerable to shoulder surfing attacks where someone watches the user enter the PIN or password. The availability of smart phones with video recording capabilities has made this kind of attack even easier.

On some computing devices the host operating system allows users to save passwords on the device itself so that the passwords do not have to be manually reentered for subsequent authorization events. While this may make it more likely that a user will choose a strong password it can lead to problems if the host operating system releases the password without any additional prompting. For example if the user shares the computing device with family members or a visiting friend those people might be able to access otherwise secure resources without the user s consent.

There are a number of situations where multiple people might have access to a single computing device. For example devices may be casually shared among family members and or friends. For example a parent may let a child use the computing device to play a game. Devices may be lost or stolen and used by an unauthorized person. If the device is unlocked at the time it s shared lost or stolen the person possessing the device may have unrestricted access to resources that the device owner may want to keep private. For example application programs that manage sensitive data such as banking or brokerage records and or stored passwords for corporate email accounts websites or other online services may be available for use by unauthorized users.

The techniques and systems disclosed herein pertain to preventing unauthorized access to computing resources by unauthorized persons by deploying biometric security measures.

To implement biometric security the computing device possibly by the operating system OS may obtain samples of one or more biometric factors unique to the owner. The computing device may construct pattern matching templates corresponding to the biometric samples which may be stored for later use when a protected resource is requested. Computing resources may be selected for protection by the biometric security mechanism by an authorized user or by other techniques or default settings. Before allowing certain restricted actions the OS may request that the user provide a sample of one of the previously registered biometric factors. If the biometric sample matches the user s stored pattern matching template the OS may grant access to the computing resource otherwise the OS may deny access to the computing resource.

In some embodiments different types of biometric factors may be associated with different resources. Thus to access a computing resource an associated biometric sample may have to be obtained from an authorized user. Some biometric samples may be obtained from a user using an unobtrusive process and thus captured without distracting the user. In various embodiments a first device may include a protected resource. A second device may access the protected resource when a user of the second device is an authorized user. The first device may exchange biometric data with the second device to verify the identity of the user prior to providing access by the user to the protected resource via the second device.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

The techniques and systems disclosed herein pertain to preventing unauthorized access to computing resources by unauthorized persons by deploying biometric security. The computing resources may include applications files passwords objects and or other computing resources which are accessible on a computer device that is running an operating system OS . However in some instances some of these computing resources may be available to other devices via a network connection. In some embodiments the computing resources may be protected by biometric security while made available to other devices via the network.

To implement the biometric security measures the computing device may obtain samples of one or more biometric factors unique to the owner. These biometric factors might include some or all of the following Fingerprints palm vein patterns images of the owner s face samples of the owner s voice and other physical or behavioral characteristics. The computing device possibly by the OS may construct pattern matching templates corresponding to the biometric samples which may be stored for later use when a protected resource is requested. Computing resources may be selected for protection by the biometric security by an authorized user or by others such as by using rules managed by the OS and or rules managed by developers of applications or other computing resources. Before allowing certain restricted actions the OS may request that the user provide a sample of one of the previously registered biometric factors. If the biometric sample matches the user s stored pattern matching template the OS may grant access to the computing resource otherwise the OS may deny access to the computing resource.

The computing device and or the OS may implement biometric security using one or more techniques. Biometric security may be implemented using application cloaking which involves the OS requiring the user to provide a biometric sample that matches a previously registered pattern matching template before launching a particular application. Biometric security may be implemented using in app authentication where a developer is responsible for preventing unauthorized users from accessing application data. In in app authentication before accessing sensitive data or performing other restricted actions the application asks the OS to verify the identity of the person running the application. In some embodiments biometric security may be implemented to protect stored passwords and or to eliminate the need for passwords. For example the biometric samples may be used in place of traditional passwords rather than being used to retrieve passwords from otherwise secure or locked storage e.g. a password locker etc. 

In accordance with one or more embodiments different types of biometric samples may be collected and or utilized by the computing device and or OS. The collection may be performed when configured by the user and with the consent of the user. Samples of some biometric factors may be collected by an unobtrusive process which requires no volitional act thought or prompting of action for the user at the time of collection despite consent to these actions in an earlier configuration process. Examples of these types of biometric samples may include analysis of images of a user s face captured by a camera and analysis of touch patterns captured by a touch interface among other possibilities. These types of biometric samples may be collected while a user interacts with the computing device and may be collected without the user being explicitly aware at the time of collection of the sample. Other types of biometric samples obtrusive types may require a prompt to alert the user to take action to allow collection of the biometric sample. Examples of these types of biometric samples may include collection of a finger scan and voice speech analysis among other possibilities. In various embodiments a combination of unobtrusive and obtrusive types of biometric sampling may be implemented to minimize user distraction while balancing security risks and or other factors.

The processes and systems described herein may be implemented in a number of ways. Example implementations are provided below with reference to the following figures.

Various users may have access to the computing device . However only some of the users such as a user may be authorized users that are authorized to access some of the resources referred to as protected resources that are protected by at least the biometric system to prevent access by non authorized users e.g. a user . . . a user n etc. . Meanwhile some or all of the users e.g. the user the user . . . the user n etc. may be able to access via the computing device other ones of the resources referred to as unprotected resources because these resources are not protected by the biometric system .

The biometric system may include an identity component to collect biometric samples and compare these samples with previously registered pattern matching templates. The biometric samples may be stored as the previously registered pattern matching templates in a biometric datastore . The biometric system may also include a configuration component that is in communication with the resources . The configuration component may associate one or more computer resources with one or more biometric samples through a mapping or other configuration which may then require receipt of biometric sample s that match previously registered pattern matching template s prior to the user receiving access to the protected resources . The identity component the configuration component and the biometric datastore are discussed in further detail with reference to .

The computing device may have additional features and or functionality. For example the computing device may also include additional data storage devices removable and or non removable such as for example magnetic disks optical disks or tape. Such additional storage may include removable storage and or non removable storage. Computer readable media may include at least two types of computer readable media namely computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media may include volatile and non volatile removable and non removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions data structures program modules or other data. System memory removable storage and non removable storage are all examples of computer storage media. Computer storage media includes but is not limited to RAM ROM EEPROM flash memory or other memory technology CD ROM digital versatile disks DVD or other optical storage magnetic cassettes magnetic tape magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices or any other non transmission medium that can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by the computing device . Any such computer storage media may be part of the computing device . Moreover the computer readable media may include computer executable instructions that when executed by the processor s perform various functions and or operations described herein.

In contrast communication media may embody computer readable instructions data structures program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transmission mechanism. As defined herein computer storage media does not include communication media.

The identity component may collect biometric samples and compare these samples to previously registered pattern matching templates. The identity component may include a biometric collection module to collect biometric samples from users. The biometric collection module may be initially used to capture samples which are stored for later use during a verification process. The biometric collection module may also be used to collect samples during the verification process. The biometric collection module may collect biometric samples from available hardware such as without limitation a touch sensor display a camera a biometric sampler e.g. a finger scanner etc. a microphone and or other types of hardware that capture biometric samples.

Biometric samples may be classified into at least three groups hand based biometrics face head biometrics and other biometrics. Example hand based biometrics may include but is not limited to the following. One type is fingerprints which can also include biometrics related to features of the finger and or fingernails. Another example hand based biometric can be hand geometry which can relate to size shape or other dimensions of the user s hand including fingers knuckles wrists etc. Additionally a vein pattern or other vascular features can be another example as can a palm print pattern or portion thereof biometrics and traditionally have a relatively high level of uniqueness. A grip configuration can be another example such as the relative position of fingers when holding touching or interacting with the device. Another example can be a hand thermogram that can for example employ a heat based signature. These biometric samples may be obtained by a touch sensor display a biometric sampler e.g. dedicated finger scanner etc. and or other dedicated or available hardware.

Example face head biometrics may include a facial thermogram that like the hand thermogram can relate to a heat signature but in this case the heat signature is for the face of the user. Facial features including but not limited to features associated with an earlobe forehead lips etc. of the user can also serve as example biometrics as can retinal features and iris features e.g. iris patterns blink patterns sclera vein patterns etc. .

Other biometrics may include a voice pattern and physical movement measurements e.g. gait interaction with a device etc. . For example a keystroke dynamic may examine intervals trajectories rhythms etc. as a user is interacting with a device. Other patterns of force and acceleration along with intervals trajectories rhythms etc. may also be measured. Another example can be an odor or pheromone or another bodily excretion such as sweat or saliva. In addition heart beat patterns or rhythms heart rate as well as other vascular biometrics such as blood pressure can also represent example biometrics.

The identity component may include a biometric comparison module . The biometric comparison module may transform a biometric sample captured by the biometric collection module into a registered pattern matching template that is stored in the biometric datastore or into a pattern template for comparison with registered pattern matching templates that are stored in the biometric datastore . The biometric comparison module may construct statistical pattern matching templates which can consistently and reliably associate biometric samples from an authorized user with that specific authorized user while distinguishing biometric samples from other users as not being from the authorized user.

The configuration component may include a biometric assignment module . The biometric assignment module may associate one or more of the resources with one or more biometric samples through a mapping association or other configuration. Once mapped or otherwise associated access to the resource may require receipt of biometric sample s that match previously registered pattern matching template s prior to the user receiving access to the resources . The biometric assignment module may allow an authorized user to determine at least some of the assignments of biometrics if any to respective computing resources. For example the authorized user may interact with a user interface e.g. the UI shown in to assign biometric security to at least some computing resources. The protected resources may also be mapped or associated with biometric security based on default instructions of the OS designations by application developers e.g. software instructions tags etc. and or other default associations or other user configurations etc. The biometric assignment module may also provide options for different types of biometric factors for association with respective computing resources. As discussed above types of biometrics include face head biometrics finger hand biometrics etc. The biometric assignment module may also remove association between the computing resource and biometric security such as when the authorized user desires to share a protected resource with a friend or other person.

The configuration component may include a biometric management module . The biometric management module may control access to the protected resources in response to matching biometric samples and or prevent access to the protected resources in response to non matching biometric samples from a user. In some embodiments the biometric management module may employ an encryption decryption module to secure the protected resources and or provide access to the protected resources . The encryption decryption module may use private and public keys to encrypt decrypt the protected resources . In accordance with various embodiments the biometric datastore may store unique identifiers e.g. the registered pattern matching template etc. that are associated with private and or public keys. Thus when a matching biometric sample is obtained the corresponding identifier may be used to obtain keys necessary to decrypt a protected resource. Likewise the computing resources may be encrypted using the reverse process possibly under control of the biometric comparison module . Thus the biometric comparison module and or the biometric management module may interact with the encryption decryption module .

In some embodiments the biometric management module may provide access to some computing resources by a remote device operated by an authorized user when the computing resources are associated with a biometric security. This functionality is discussed below with reference to .

As discussed above biometric security may be implemented using application cloaking in app authentication password protection and or as an alternative to typed or otherwise user entered passwords or PINs. Application cloaking involves the OS requiring the user to provide a biometric sample that matches a previously registered pattern matching template before launching a particular application. In app authentication allows a developer to prevent unauthorized users from accessing application data and or functions by having the developer determine when to request biometric samples. In in app authentication before accessing sensitive data functions or performing other restricted actions the application asks the OS to verify the identity of the person running the application. In some embodiments biometric security may be implemented to protect stored passwords and or to eliminate the need for passwords. The biometric samples may be used in place of traditional passwords rather than being used to retrieve passwords from otherwise secure or locked storage e.g. a password locker etc. . Here the computing device sends the user s identity and the request to a resource. The key feature here is that the biometric sample is mapped directly onto the user s identity rather than acting as a proxy for a password or other credential. Thus the configuration component may implement biometric security using one some or all of these techniques.

As discussed above the computing device may operate in conjunction with or may utilize remote servers . For example the computing device may communicate with the remote servers over one or more network s . The network s may be any type of wired or wireless networks including mobile telephone networks the internet and so forth.

The remote servers may include a computing infrastructure of processors storage software data access and so forth that is maintained and accessible via the network s . The remote servers may not require end user knowledge of the physical location and configuration of the system that delivers the services. Common expressions associated for these remote servers may include on demand computing software as a service SaaS platform computing network accessible platform cloud services data centers and so forth. The remote servers may include processor s and computer readable media which may store or otherwise have access to some or all of the components described with reference to the computer readable media of the computing device .

The networking environment may include an ancillary computing device which may be accessible by a user that is authorized to access some of the protected resources that are stored on or accessed via the computing device . The ancillary computing device may be in communication with the computing device via the network s . The network s may include a home network a local area network LAN the internet wireless networks etc. The authorized user may use the ancillary computing device to access the protected resource from the computing device . However since the computing resource being accessed is protected additional processing may be performed to ensure that the user requesting the computing resource is an authorized user.

In some embodiments the ancillary device may request a biometric sample from the user via the identity component . Identity data associated with the biometric sample may be processed and transmitted to the computing device prior to the computing device transmitting or permitting access by the user to the protected resource .

In various embodiments the computing device may transmit roaming biometric data RBD along with the protected resource such as when the protected resource is encrypted. The ancillary computing device may obtain the biometric sample and process the biometric sample using the RBD . The RBD may enable access to keys used by the encryption decryption module to decrypt the protected resource when the biometric sample from the user matches the pattern matching template that corresponds to the protected resource . The ancillary computing device may include additional encryption decryption used to access the RBD . For example the ancillary computing device may include the same operating system as the computing device which facilitates secure exchange or sharing of the biometric data via the RBD .

The process includes a configuration setup process that includes an operation and an operation . At the identity component may capture one or more biometric samples from an authorized user. The biometric samples may be captured using various different types of hardware such as the touch sensor display the camera the biometric sampler the microphone and or other hardware. At the configuration component may assign or associate at least some of the biometric samples or pattern matching templates from the biometric samples to computing resources to transform the computing resources into the protected resources . The biometric samples and assignments may be stored in the biometric datastore . To access the protected resources in the future the authorized user has to provide biometric samples that match the pattern matching templates for the protected resources .

The process includes an access process to enable access of the protected resources or the unprotected resources after the configuration process has been performed via the operations and . The access process may begin at an operation . At the operating system may receive an access request for a computing resource from a user.

At the configuration component may determine whether the computing resource is a protected resource e.g. the protected resource . When the computing resource is not protected following the no route from the decision operation then the process may advance to an operation to grant access to the computing resource. In this scenario the computing resource is an unprotected resource e.g. one of the unprotected resources .

However when the computing resource is protected following the yes route from the decision operation then the process may advance to an operation . At the identity component may collect one or more biometric samples from the user.

At the identity component may determine whether the collected biometric samples are a match with an authorized user. For example the biometric comparison module may determine whether the collected biometric samples match pattern matching templates associated with the requested computing resource. When the samples are a match following the yes route from the decision operation then the process may advance to the operation to grant access to the computing resource requested at the operation . In this scenario the computing resource is a protected resource e.g. one of the protected resources . In some instances the operation may include decryption of the computing resource to enable the access by the user.

When the samples are not a match following the no route from the decision operation then the process may advance to an operation to deny access to the computing resource requested at the operation .

At the identity component may determine whether to collect biometric sample s using an unobtrusive capture. An unobtrusive capture may be a process that does not disrupt the user or require any thought or volitional act by the user such as by capturing an image of the user s face or receiving a touch input from the user that is already interacting with a touch device for other reasons e.g. interacting with the touch sensor display etc. .

When the decision operation allows collection of biometric samples using the unobtrusive process following the yes route from the decision operation then the process may advance to an operation to collect the biometric sample s using the unobtrusive process. In some instances the identity component may collect the biometrics samples using an unobtrusive process that is continuous random periodic etc. and thus the identity component may have a most recent biometric sample available for analysis. Therefore the collection at the operation may occur prior to the request at the operation in some instances.

At the identity component may determine whether the collected biometric samples are a match with an authorized user. For example the biometric comparison module may determine whether the collected biometric samples match pattern matching templates associated with the requested computing resource. When the samples are a match following the yes route from the decision operation then the process may advance to the operation . At the OS may grant access to the computing resource requested at the operation possibly by decrypting the computing resource using the encryption decryption module or by otherwise allowing access to the computing resource.

When the samples are not a match following the no route from the decision operation or when the decision operation does not allow collection of biometric samples using the unobtrusive process following the no route from the decision operation then the process may advance to the operation . At the identity component may prompt the user to allow the identity component to collect the biometric sample s . In some instances the unobtrusive process outlined above may fail because the using does not provide correct samples or is otherwise unaware of what samples are to be collected e.g. is not looking at a camera that takes a picture for use in facial recognition etc. . Thus the operation may be used to prompt the user to perform actions to allow the identity component to collect the biometric samples.

At the identity component may collect the biometric samples. The type of biometric samples collected at the operation may be the same or different than the type of biometric samples collected at the operation .

At the identity component may determine whether the collected biometric samples are a match with an authorized user. For example the biometric comparison module may determine whether the collected biometric samples match pattern matching templates associated with the requested computing resource. When the samples are a match following the yes route from the decision operation then the process may advance to the operation . At the OS may grant access to the computing resource requested at the operation possibly by decrypting the computing resource using the encryption decryption module or by otherwise allowing access to the computing resource. When the samples are not a match following the no route from the decision operation then at the OS may deny access to the computing resource requested at the operation . In some embodiments the OS may enable the user to provide an alternative proof of identity e.g. a typed password a PIN etc. in the event that the user cannot provide the matching biometric sample. For example when the authorized user s hand arm is in a cast.

At the ancillary computing device may receive a request from a user to access a computing resource that is located e.g. stored executed from etc. the computing device .

At the ancillary computing device may transmit a request to the computing device for the computing resource. The request may be received at by the computing device .

At the computing device may determine whether the computing resource is a protected resource e.g. the protected resource . When the computing resource in not a protected resource following the no route from the decision operation then the process may advance to an operation . At the computing device may allow access to the computing resource such as by transmitting the computing resource to the ancillary device . The ancillary device may receive the computing resource at .

When the computing resource in a protected resource following the yes route from the decision operation then the process may advance to an operation . At the computing device may require biometric samples to be collected by the ancillary computing device from the user in order to allow access to the computing resource. At the ancillary computing device may collect biometric sample s from the user.

In accordance with some embodiments at the computing device may provide roaming biometric data RBD e.g. the RBD to the ancillary computing device which may be used to verify a match of the biometric samples obtained at the operation . At the ancillary computing device may receive the RBD. In some embodiments the ancillary computing device may decrypt the RBD prior to using the RBD to extract a pattern matching template and or other data from the RBD.

At the ancillary computing device may process the biometric sample s using the RBD to determine whether the biometric sample s match a pattern matching template. At the ancillary computing device may access the computing resource in response to the biometric sample s matching of the pattern matching template. In some embodiments the operation may include decrypting the remote computing device using information in the RBD.

In some embodiments the processing of the biometric sample s may be performed by the computing device . For example after the operation the ancillary computing device may transmit identity data associated with the biometric sample s to the computing device which may compare the identity data to the pattern matching template and in response to a match provide access to the remote computing device such as discussed in the operations and . In this situation the computing resource may or may not be encrypted.

The UI may include a custom setting section to enable an authorized user to location resources using a search control and or using a filter control which may provide access to resources in a resource mapping section e.g. files applications objects passwords etc. . The resource mapping section may show resources and allow mapping none or to one or more types of biometric samples. The resource mapping section may include a none selector a face selector a voice selector a touch selector and or other types of biometric samples which when selected require matching samples from the authorized user prior to access of the associated computing resource. For example a computing resource object m may include a selection of the face selector and the touch selector . Thus to access the computing resource object m the user may have to provide both a face sample e.g. for face recognition retinal scanning etc. and a touch sample e.g. a fingerprint scan touch pattern via a touch sensor display etc. . In some embodiments the computing resource may be accessed by providing any one of the associated biometric samples. In these instances using the example of the object m from above the user may have to provide a face sample or a touch sample to access the computing resource object m .

An OS selector when selected may implement default settings used by the OS for this computing resource. Likewise an App selector when selected may implement default settings used by an application e.g. as determined by a developer etc. for this computing resource. When the OS selector and or the App selector is selected then corresponding selectors may become selected depending on the default values associated with the OS selector and or the App selector .

The UI may include a default settings section that may enable a user to apply default OS settings using a default OS settings control . The default settings section that may enable a user to apply default App settings using a default App settings control .

In a very basic configuration the computing device typically includes at least one processing unit and system memory . Depending on the exact configuration and type of computing device the system memory may be volatile such as RAM non volatile such as ROM flash memory etc. or some combination of the two. The system memory typically includes an operating system one or more program modules and may include program data . The operating system includes a component based framework that supports components including properties and events objects inheritance polymorphism reflection and provides an object oriented component based application programming interface API . The computing device is of a very basic configuration demarcated by a dashed line . Again a terminal may have fewer components but will interact with a computing device that may have such a basic configuration.

The computing device may have additional features or functionality. For example the computing device may also include additional data storage devices removable and or non removable such as for example magnetic disks optical disks or tape. Such additional storage is illustrated in by removable storage and non removable storage . The computing device may also have input device s such as keyboard mouse pen voice input device touch input device etc. Output device s such as a display speakers printer etc. may also be included. These devices are well known in the art and are not discussed at length here.

The computing device may also contain communication connections that allow the device to communicate with other computing devices such as over a network. These networks may include wired networks as well as wireless networks. The communication connections are one example of communication media. The communication media may typically be embodied by computer readable instructions data structures program modules etc.

It is appreciated that the illustrated computing device is only one example of a suitable device and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of the various embodiments described. Other well known computing devices systems environments and or configurations that may be suitable for use with the embodiments include but are not limited to personal computers server computers hand held or laptop devices multiprocessor systems microprocessor base systems set top boxes game consoles programmable consumer electronics network PCs minicomputers mainframe computers distributed computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices and or the like. For example some or all of the components of the computing device may be implemented in a cloud computing environment such that resources and or services are made available via a computer network for selective use by client devices.
