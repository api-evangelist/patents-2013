This application is a U.S. national counterpart application of international application serial No. PCT US2013 070922 filed Nov. 20 2013 which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 783 621 filed Mar. 14 2013. The entire disclosures of PCT US2013 070922 and U.S. Ser. No. 61 783 621 are hereby incorporated by reference.

The present disclosure relates generally to turbine engines and more specifically to the control of hybrid turbo electric aero propulsion systems.

Gas turbine engines can be used to power aircraft watercraft power generators and the like. Gas turbine engines typically include a compressor a combustor and a turbine. A fan or propeller may be used to draw air into the engine. The compressor compresses the air and delivers higher pressure air to the combustor. In the combustor fuel is mixed with the higher pressure air and is ignited. Products of the combustion reaction in the combustor are directed into the turbine where work is extracted to drive the compressor and sometimes an output shaft. Left over products of the combustion are exhausted out of the turbine and may provide thrust in some applications.

Where the turbomachinery is only intended to act as a genset it may consist only of a turboshaft engine in which a motor is driven by an engine shaft. If the turbomachinery provides both propulsion and power one or more generators may be mounted to an engine shaft.

Hybrid turbo electric propulsion systems may be used to power aircraft. In hybrid turbo electric aero propulsion systems a motor may be used in combination with a turbine engine to provide motive power to one or more fans or propellers. In distributed propulsion systems the fans or propellers are placed at other locations around the aircraft rather than being co located with the engine. These distributed devices may be referred to as propulsors. The propulsors include a motor generator which drives a fan. The fan may be used to provide forward thrust or reverse thrust e.g. during landings . Additionally the fan may be used to extract work from the airflow to provide electrical power. This may be useful for example during failure scenarios.

Thrust can be modulated by varying turbine speed fan pitch guide vane angles nozzle inlet areas and or other operating parameters.

While the concepts of the present disclosure are susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms specific embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and are described in detail below. It should be understood that there is no intent to limit the concepts of the present disclosure to the particular forms disclosed. On the contrary the intent is to cover all modifications equivalents and alternatives consistent with the present disclosure and the appended claims.

Referring to an embodiment of a hybrid turbo electric aero propulsion system includes a propulsion optimizer . The optimizer is configured to optimize one or more optimization parameters e.g. efficiency performance reliability etc. of the system by optimizing certain subsystems of the system independently according to their respective time constants and then coordinating the subsystem optimizations to provide optimal control of the entire system . As used herein optimize optimal and similar terminology connotes an algorithmic process by which parameter values are computed and used to control the operation of the various components of the system to achieve a desired objective such as maximum efficiency. In this way the optimizer can enable the engine to operate at a desired level of efficiency under any operating conditions in an aircraft or other vehicle powered by the system . For example the optimizer can integrate various control strategies of the engine and the stored energy subsystem to operate the engine at a desired efficiency point for various load conditions. When used to optimize efficiency the optimizer can for example help improve the thrust specific fuel consumption SFC of the engine and or reduce the engine s overall emissions.

In some embodiments all or portions of the optimizer may be embodied as computerized programs modules routines logic or the like in an engine controller which may be embodied as for example a Full Authority Digital Engine Controller or FADEC one or more generator control units one or more motor control units one or more fan control units one or more energy storage control units or a combination of any of these. In other embodiments the optimizer may be embodied in a separate controller that interfaces with the control units via one or more electronic communication links or networks. The optimizer integrates real time feedback control and on line optimization to enable the system to operate in accordance with one or more optimization objectives expressed as for example optimization parameters . In some embodiments the optimizer is configured to maximize the fuel efficiency of the system .

The illustrative hybrid propulsion system includes multiple sources of motive power e.g. a turbine engine one or more motors and one or more propulsors . In various embodiments of the system the engine and or the motor s may be used to power one or more fans . For instance the motor s may be used to supply rotational power to the fan s during periods of operation in which the motor s can provide greater efficiency than the engine . As an example the motor s may be used during operating periods in which shorter term or decreased levels of propulsive power are required whereas the engine may be favored during periods of operation in which a longer term or more constant sustained level of propulsive power is required. In embodiments where the system includes a distributed propulsion system one or more of the fans may be mounted to the aircraft at other locations apart from the engine . In other words one or more of the fan s may not be embodied within the engine in some versions of the system . Such fans may be driven respectively by additional motors . Fan motor combinations that are not embodied within the engine may be referred to as propulsors . Aspects of the operation of the engine the fan s and the motor s are electronically controlled as described below.

Electrical energy is supplied to the motor s by a stored energy subsystem . The illustrative stored energy subsystem includes an energy storage device a power converter and an inverter . The illustrative system includes one or more generators that may from time to time receive rotational power from the turbine engine . The power converter may convert voltage generated by the generator s to electrical input e.g. alternating current AC or direct current DC as may be required by a particular design of the system . The energy storage device receives electrical input from the power converter from time to time and stores it for later use. The motor s can receive electrical input from the inverter which may be connected to the energy storage device and or the power converter directly. In some embodiments portions of the stored energy subsystem may be distributed among other components of the system . For example in some embodiments the power converter may be embodied in the generator control unit and or the inverter may be embodied in the motor control unit .

The energy storage device can store otherwise unused electrical energy that is generated by the generator s in response to rotational power received by the generator s from the engine e.g. via a power take off shaft . For example the energy storage device may be used to provide electrical power during transient loads and or to store regenerative energy. The energy storage device may be embodied as for example one or more superconducting energy storage devices batteries or battery packs.

The power converter may be embodied as for example a converter that converts alternating electrical current AC to direct electrical current DC or a converter that converts DC to AC as needed. As an example a DC to AC converter can convert the battery voltage stored in the energy storage to a level that is compatible with the DC voltage generated from the generator after rectification.

The generator s may each be embodied as for example a superconducting electric machine a permanent magnet synchronous machine or a wound field synchronous machine. The AC voltage of the generator may be converted to DC using for example a controlled rectifier or active rectifier. This DC output may be converted to variable frequency and variable voltage AC by the inverter to control the speed and torque of the propulsor motors in order to drive the fans which provide the thrust. As should be appreciated by those skilled in the art the inverter may be embodied as electrical circuitry having a suitable topology according to the requirements of a particular design of the system .

The operation of each of the engine the fan s the generator s the motor s and the energy subsystem is electronically controlled by a corresponding controller e.g. the control units respectively. The control units may each be embodied as electrical circuitry e.g. as an integrated circuit or microprocessor based system on a chip which sends electrical signals to the respective devices systems to adjust the operating parameters of the devices systems as needed during the operation of the system e.g. during different portions of the flight envelope in the case of an aircraft . For example each of the controllers may electronically turn on or off a number of different electrical or electro mechanical switches that are connected to the devices systems as needed to achieve a desired operating point e.g. a desired amount of propulsive power during a particular portion of the flight envelope. As described in more detail below the illustrative optimizer includes a propulsion control optimization subsystem a power plant control optimization subsystem and an energy storage charge discharge optimization subsystem which communicate optimal values of relevant operating parameters to the relevant devices systems based on desired optimization objective s and relevant current operating conditions of the system .

The illustrative turbine engine is a multi shaft turbofan gas turbine engine however aspects of the present disclosure are applicable to other types of turbine engines including various types of turbofan turboprop and turboshaft systems. In the turbine engine the fan s which may be embodied as e.g. one or more fans variable pitch propellers etc. may draw air into the engine or in the case of the propulsors may be used to provide motive force. Referring specifically to the engine mounted fans some of the drawn in air may bypass other engine components and thereby generate propulsion thrust. In the engine the drawn in air is forwarded to one or more compressors . The compressor s increase the pressure of the air and forward the higher pressure air to a combustion section . In the combustion section the pressurized air is mixed with fuel which is supplied to the combustion section by a fuel supply such as a fuel injector not shown . An igniter not shown is typically used to cause the mixture of air and fuel to combust. The high energy combusted air is directed to one or more turbines . In the illustrative embodiment a high pressure turbine is disposed in axial flow series with a low pressure turbine . The combusted air expands through the turbines causing them to rotate. The combusted air is then exhausted through e.g. a propulsion nozzle not shown which may generate additional propulsion thrust.

The rotation of the turbines causes the engine shafts to rotate. In the illustrative embodiments rotation of the low pressure turbine drives a low pressure shaft which can drive an engine mounted fan . In some embodiments the low pressure shaft may drive an electrical machine such as a generator which may for example provide electrical power to the aircraft s electrical system. Rotation of the high pressure turbine drives a high pressure shaft which drives the compressor s . In some embodiments the shafts may be concentrically disposed. The high pressure turbine drives a power take off assembly via the high pressure shaft which in the illustrated embodiment drives a generator . The generator s may generate electrical power that is supplied to other components or systems of the aircraft or other vehicle to which it is coupled. The motor receives electrical energy from the stored energy subsystem and converts the received electrical energy into rotational power which can then be supplied to the fan s via a motor shaft .

The engine controller may control the overall operation of the engine . For example the engine controller may control the rate of fuel flow to the combustion section as well as the airflow through the engine e.g. by varying the pitch angle of vanes of the fan s . As such all or portions of the controllers may be embodied in the engine controller .

In general the engine controller and or the controllers receive electrical signals from a number of different sensors which are installed at various locations on the engine and or other mechanical components of the system to sense various physical parameters such as temperature T air pressure P torque pitch angle rotational speed electrical current i and voltage v which represent various aspects of the current operating condition of the system . The sensors may supply electrical signals representing the instantaneous values of the sensed information to the optimizer either directly or indirectly via the engine controller or the controllers as needed. In response to the sensor signals the optimizer supplies various commands to the engine controller and or the controllers as needed to control various aspects of the operation of the system in accordance with the desired optimization objective s .

The generator control unit controls the operation of the generator s . That is the generator control unit adjusts the operating parameters of the generator s to vary the amount of rotational energy that the generator s draw from the shaft . For instance the generator control unit may configure the generator s to either generate electrical energy or not generate electrical energy or to generate a certain amount of electrical energy for storage in the energy storage based on current operating conditions and or other parameters. As noted above the power converter may be contained in the generator control unit in some embodiments in order to convert electrical energy into a form that can either be stored by the energy storage or used by the motor s .

The motor control units control the operation of the motors to convert electrical energy supplied to the motors by the stored energy subsystem to rotational power which the motors supply to the fans via respective motor shafts e.g. the shafts . For instance a motor control unit may turn a motor on or off or change the motor speed during specific portions of the flight envelope based on current operating conditions and or other parameters. As noted above the inverter may be contained in the motor control unit in some embodiments in order to convert electrical input received from either the power converter or the energy storage into a form that can be used by the motor .

The energy storage control unit controls the operation of the stored energy subsystem to control the operation of the power converter the charging of the energy storage and the discharge of electrical energy to the motors e.g. via the inverter the power converter and or the energy storage . For example the energy storage control unit may turn the charging of the energy storage on or off or turn the discharging of electrical energy by the power converter or the energy storage on or off during specific portions of the flight envelope based on current operating conditions and or other parameters. Adjustments in the amount of electrical energy supplied by the generator s the stored energy subsystem and the motor s may vary based on the amount of electrical energy demanded by the system and or the desired amount of propulsive power as determined by for example current operating conditions performance or fuel efficiency considerations.

The fan control unit controls the operation of the fan s by varying the amount of pitch angle of the fan blades for example to achieve a desired propulsive effect. For example the fan control unit may increase or decrease the pitch angle of one or more of the fan s during specific portions of the flight envelope based on current operating conditions and or other parameters.

Referring now to an embodiment of a system architecture for power conversion aspects of a distributed version of the system in which the fans are not embodied with the engine is shown. The embodiment includes an engine control subsystem a generator control subsystem an energy storage control subsystem a motor control subsystem and a fan control subsystem . The engine subsystem transfers rotational power to the generator subsystem . The generator subsystem converts the rotational power to electrical power. The generator subsystem may transfer some of the electrical power to the energy storage subsystem and may transfer some of the electrical power to the motor subsystem . The motor subsystem converts the electrical power back to rotational power and transfers rotational power to the fan control subsystem . In the illustrated embodiment the motor subsystem includes multiple motors each of which drives a different fan . As shown in the subsystems may each be embodied as a combination of mechanical or electro mechanical devices or systems and electrical control circuitry. For example aspects of the controllers described above may be embodied in the subsystems . With the optimizer optimization and control can be achieved at a local level e.g. at the subsystems and also at a global system wide level e.g. at the level of the system as a whole .

In an aircraft the required thrust for propulsion can be provided by a jet engine driving a fan e.g. as in a turbofan based system or a variable pitch propeller or fan e.g. as in a turboshaft system . As shown in instead of driving the fans from the engine the fans can be located on the aircraft apart from the engine and driven by the electric motors . The electric power required for driving the electric motors is obtained from a generator driven by the jet engine . Electric motors are typically highly efficient and their efficiency is generally more than 90 . Jet engines typically are not as efficient as electric motors. The efficiency of the jet engine varies with for example the speed and the load seen by the engine. The jet engines will have a highest efficiency at a particular operating point and speed.

In the engine drives the generator and the generator output voltage is converted to variable frequency and variable voltage AC which is used to drive the electric motors which drive the fans which provide propulsive thrust for the aircraft. In some embodiments the same generator can provide power to the multiple motors to drive multiple propellers or fans so that the thrust produced is distributed. In other embodiments multiple generators may each drive a respective motor .

To enable the engine to operate at a maximum efficiency operating point the optimizer combines the following parameters of the engine generator energy storage motor and fan control subsystems transient power transferred to the motors from the energy storage unit and or the power converter stored electrical energy from the generator and stored in the energy storage unit during the operating region where excess energy is available from the engine pitch angle control for control of the propeller or fan and engine cycle for control of the operation of the engine .

The optimizer can combine all of these parameters into an overall or global control system to operate the engine at a desired efficiency level e.g. a maximum efficiency under all operating conditions. As the number of control effectors governing overall system efficiency is larger for distributed propulsion systems than for conventional aircraft propulsion systems the optimizer can integrate multiple control effectors pursuant to the desired optimization objective e.g. maximum efficiency . Depending on the operating region of the aircraft the optimizer can manipulate one or more or all of the control aspects to obtain the desired efficiency of the overall propulsion system . In addition the optimizer can manipulate the control parameters of the generator to obtain the required electrical inputs for the thrust providing motors . Further the optimizer can prioritize the control effectors of a distributed propulsion system to provide an optimal control strategy for the entire system . In this way the optimizer can enable operation of the engine propulsor motors and the rest of the system under desired efficiency operating points to for example reduce the amount of fuel consumed by the engine and thus improve the system s overall SFC.

Referring to an embodiment of the optimizer is shown. A desired optimization objective is embodied as a maximum efficiency parameter e.g. the objective of the optimization is to maximize the fuel efficiency of the system . A desired thrust represents the currently desired thrust as determined from e.g. sensor input or another control algorithm during operation of the system . A controller applies the inputs and the feedback values to the control algorithms for the subsystems illustrated in and supplies the above described parameters which are obtained from the control subsystems to an energy optimization algorithm . In the example of the algorithm computes optimal values for stored energy total load and engine speed based on the maximum efficiency and the desired thrust using for example a nonlinear optimal control method. In some embodiments the energy optimization algorithm prioritizes the optimization of the subsystems as indicated by the circled numerical values shown in . That is based on time constants response times and or other constraints associated with the various subsystems the algorithm may begin optimizing one of the subsystems before the others. For instance in the embodiment the optimizations for the subsystems power converters and propulsor motors may be initiated before the others while optimizations for the subsystem engine may be initiated later. Further in the embodiment of aspects of the power converter optimization may be performed contemporaneously with motor and generator optimizations. As such the power converter optimization can impact or be impacted by the motor and generator optimizations and vice versa. The values are fed back to the controller and applied to the control subsystems .

Referring now to an embodiment of the optimizer is shown in the broader context of an entire physical system which includes other aspects of an aircraft and the feedback control subsystems described above. The illustrative embodiment is configured to optimize the system for efficiency. In order to maintain the engine speed at a certain value to achieve the optimum efficiency the power delivered by the engine needs to be maintained in a certain typically narrow range. According to the embodiment the optimizer is composed of five optimization subsystems a motor speed set point subsystem a fan pitch angle set point subsystem a generator torque set point subsystem an engine speed set point subsystem and an energy storage charge discharge i subsystem . The asterisk denotes that the variable is a set point and not the measured or model estimated state. Other control variables not depicted in the diagrams may include for example inlet nozzle area commands and or variable guide vane set points.

In the illustrated embodiment the subsystems are arranged and coordinated according to the relationships between the electrical and mechanical power sources. For instance the propulsion load control optimization subsystem coordinates the optimizations of the motor speed set point optimization subsystem and the fan pitch angle set point optimization subsystem and sends both the optimal pitch angle set point and the optimal motor speed set point to the energy storage charge discharge optimization subsystem . Similarly the power plant power optimization subsystem coordinates the optimizations of the generator torque set point optimization subsystem and the engine speed set point optimization subsystem and sends both the optimal generator torque set point and the optimal generator speed set point to the energy storage charge discharge optimization subsystem .

The inputs to the optimization subsystems as depicted in are the aircraft required temperature T the ambient temperature T the ambient air pressure P the motor torque the motor speed the generator torque the generator speed the fan pitch angle the electrical current i and the voltage v . These inputs may be obtained from e.g. the sensors the engine controller and or other components of the aircraft . In addition to these measured inputs the controlled states are estimated by a system model or portions thereof and fed back into each set point optimization subsystem where a state refers to one or a combination of actual or estimated operating conditions of the system at a given point in time which are controlled by the control algorithms of the system . The controlled states are estimated at discrete times denoted by the superscript i .

The optimization subsystems use these inputs as well as their respective local model to determine the optimum value for each set point to optimize the engine and system for efficiency. Each of the local models includes all or a portion of the system model . For instance a particular local model may only include values and logic that would affect the optimization of the particular parameter s of its respective subsystem . In general the term model refers to a mathematical model that is mathematical equations or algorithms and parameters that can be used to create a mathematical or estimated representation of the various controlled aspects of the system . Some examples of numerical algorithms that may be used by the optimizer include any suitable nonlinear optimization model. For instance a gradient based method such as an augmented LaGrangian method may be used in some embodiments. Each of the subsystems may use the same or different models or techniques in various embodiments of the system .

Each of the set points is fed into a corresponding controller. For example the motor speed set point optimization subsystem applies the local model and the current values of the required temperature ambient temperature ambient pressure motor torque pitch angle motor speed current and voltage inputs to the independent variable motor speed and based thereon outputs an optimal set point value for the motor speed to the motor controller . The motor controller then adjusts the operating parameters of the motor to achieve the optimal set point value for motor speed. Similarly the fan pitch angle set point optimization subsystem applies the local model and the current values of the required temperature ambient temperature ambient pressure motor torque pitch angle motor speed current and voltage inputs to the independent variables pitch angle and motor speed and based thereon outputs an optimal set point value for the fan pitch angle to the fan pitch controller . The fan controller then adjusts the operating parameters of the fan to achieve the optimal set point value for the pitch angle.

Likewise the generator torque set point optimization subsystem applies the local model and the current values of the required temperature ambient temperature ambient pressure current voltage generator torque and generator speed inputs to the independent variable generator torque and based thereon outputs an optimal set point value for the generator torque to the generator controller . The generator controller then adjusts the operating parameters of the generator to achieve the optimal set point value for the generator torque. Similarly the engine speed set point optimization subsystem applies the local model and the current values of the required temperature ambient temperature ambient pressure current voltage generator torque and generator speed inputs to the independent variables generator torque and generator speed and based thereon outputs an optimal set point value for the generator speed to the engine controller . The engine controller then adjusts the operating parameters of the engine to achieve the optimal set point value for the generator speed.

Additionally the energy storage charge discharge optimization subsystem applies the local model and the current values of the required temperature ambient temperature ambient pressure generator torque generator speed motor torque motor speed pitch angle current and voltage inputs and the current optimal set point values for pitch angle motor speed generator torque and generator speed to the independent variable current supplied by energy storage and based thereon outputs an optimal set point value for the energy storage current to the energy storage controller . The energy storage controller then adjusts the operating parameters of the stored energy subsystem including the power converter to achieve the optimal set point value for the energy storage current. In this way the energy storage charge discharge optimization subsystem integrates and coordinates the optimizations performed by the other subsystems . As such the optimizer can optimize the efficiency of the local subsystems and also optimize the entire system through the energy storage charge discharge optimization subsystem and the stored energy subsystem .

The respective controlled physical systems feed back appropriate measured states to the respective physical system controllers . This allows the optimizer to determine the accuracy of the measured state to the set point. The measured states are also incorporated into the system model and the local system models e.g. as degradation parameters .

The set points model estimated states and measured states are set calculated or measured at varying intervals of time during the operation of the system . The interval of time is determined by the physical subsystem time constant. That is the optimizations of the different subsystems may each be executed at or according to different time intervals. For example the electrical subsystems energy storage motor and generator typically have shorter time constants than the mechanical subsystems engine and fan . As a result the set points model estimated states and measured states for the electrical subsystems are typically updated more frequently than those for the mechanical subsystems . Thus in some embodiments the execution of certain of the subsystems may be prioritized according to the applicable time constants or time intervals.

As an example hypothetical suppose the optimization objective is efficient propulsion. Suppose further that together motor efficiency and propulsor e.g. fan efficiency provide optimal thrust. Further suppose that motor efficiency is as function of the motor speed and the propulsor efficiency is a function of the pitch angle and the motor speed. Given the current operating inputs the optimizer determines a combination of pitch angle set point and motor speed set point to provide optimal efficiency and thrust. However suppose that the time it takes to change the pitch angle is longer than the time it takes to vary the motor speed. Since the pitch angle and motor speed change at different rates the pitch angle and speed optimizations will occur at different rates. Accordingly the illustrative optimizer is designed to perform the pitch angle and motor speed optimizations independently but then coordinate them through the energy storage optimization.

To illustrate further if motor speed changes quickly and pitch angle changes more slowly then the optimizer can first perform an optimization in which the pitch angle is assumed to be fixed and the speed is assumed to be variable to optimize the motor speed assuming the pitch angle cannot be changed . Since the motor speed changes faster than pitch angle the optimal motor speed set point will be reached more quickly. At the same time the optimizer can perform an optimization in which the pitch angle is optimized assuming a constant speed e.g. the optimal speed set point if available . In this case the pitch angle will be optimized but at a slower rate than the motor speed and eventually the two optimizations will converge.

Referring now to a simplified block diagram of an exemplary controller in which the optimizer may be embodied is shown. The controller includes at least one processor e.g. a microprocessor microcontroller digital signal processor etc. memory and an input output I O subsystem . The controller and or portions thereof may be embodied in a control unit of the engine for example. The I O subsystem typically includes among other things an I O controller a memory controller and one or more I O ports. The processor and the I O subsystem are communicatively coupled to the memory . The memory may be embodied as any type of suitable computer memory device e.g. volatile memory such as various forms of random access memory .

The I O subsystem is communicatively coupled to one or more storage media the optimizer and communication circuitry . The storage media may include any suitable data storage device e.g. flash memory memory cards etc. . The storage media may store data relating to system operating conditions set points optimization parameters and or system models . The communication circuitry may include any suitable electronic communications link bus or network and may be configured to communicate control signals from the optimizer to for example the controllers and or to communicate operating parameters from the engine other components of the system and or sensors to the optimizer . The controller may include other components sub components and devices not illustrated in for clarity of the description. In general the components of the controller are communicatively coupled as shown in by electronic signal paths which may be embodied as any type of wired or wireless signal paths capable of facilitating communication between the respective devices and components.
