title: Translated view navigation for visualizations
abstract: Among other things, one or more techniques and/or systems are provided for defining transition zones for navigating a visualization. The visualization may be constructed from geometry of a scene and one or more texture images depicted the scene from various viewpoints. A transition zone may correspond to portions of the visualization that do not have a one-to-one correspondence with a single texture image, but are generated from textured geometry (e.g., a projection of texture imagery onto the geometry). Because a translated view may have visual error (e.g., a portion of the translated view is not correctly represented by the textured geometry), one or more transition zones, specifying translated view experiences (e.g., unrestricted view navigation, restricted view navigation, etc.), may be defined. For example, a snapback force may be applied when a current view corresponds to a transition zone having a relatively higher error.

Many users may create image data using various devices such as digital cameras tablets mobile devices smart phones etc. For example a user may capture an image of a beach using a mobile phone while on vacation. The user may upload the image to an image sharing website and may share the image with other users. In an example of image data one or more images may be used e.g. stitched together to generate a visualization of a scene depicted by the one or more images. In one example the visualization may comprise a panorama a spin movie a multi dimensional rendering etc. A visualization interface such as an immersive viewer may allow a user to visually navigate within the visualization to explore the scene represented by the visualization.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Among other things one or more systems and or techniques for defining transition zones for navigating a visualization of a scene are provided herein. That is a visualization may be constructed from one or more texture images depicting a scene from various viewpoints e.g. a panorama visualization of a renovated basement may be stitched together from one or more images depicting the renovated basement from various viewpoints . In an example during navigation within the visualization a current view of the scene may be derived from a single texture image e.g. where the texture image depicts the entire current view . In another example a current view of the scene may be derived from multiple texture images e.g. a first texture image depicting a first portion of the current view and a second texture image depicting a second portion of the current view may be projected onto a geometry to create textured geometry representing the scene such that a current view may be derived from the textured geometry . A geometry may comprise a multi dimensional representation of a surface of the scene or a portion thereof. In an example respective texture images of the scene may have corresponding geometry e.g. a first texture image has a first local geometry a second texture image has a second local geometry etc. and the scene may be represented by a geometry e.g. a global geometry derived from at least one local geometry . In another example one or more texture images may share a geometry e.g. a first texture image and a second texture image may share a first local geometry derived by a stereo matching technique .

In an example a user may have the ability to look around and or explore the renovated basement by navigating within the visualization. One or more transition zones may be defined for visually navigating the visualization. For example a first texture image and a second texture image are projected onto a geometry of a scene e.g. a local geometry of a portion of the scene depicted by the first and second texture images to create a textured geometry of the scene. A transition space may be derived from the textured geometry. The transition space may correspond to transitional navigation of the scene between the first texture image and the second texture image e.g. a current view of the scene that does not have a one to one correspondence with a single texture image but is derived from multiple texture images . In an example where a first texture image depicts a gaming area and a sitting area of the renovated basement and a second texture image depicts the sitting area and a hallway area of the renovated basement a transition space may correspond to a current view that comprises half of the some of the gaming area the entire sitting area and some of the hallway area. Thus the current view may correspond to a translated view derived from the first texture image and the second texture image.

An error basin may be determined for the transition space based upon a visual error measurement. For example an inaccurate geometry measurement a resolution fallout measurement a pixel occlusion measure a color different measurement and or other measurements or image features may be used to identify the visual error measurement. The error basin may correspond to error estimations that visual errors may arise when displaying a current view based upon geometry and or texture information within the transition space. The error basin may be used to define one or more transitional zones for navigating the visualization. In an example a first transition zone is defined within the transition space based upon one or more first translated views being below an error threshold within the error basin. The first transition zone may specify a first translated view experience for the one or more first translated views. For example a user may be allowed to freely navigate between the one or more first translated views because such views may be generated with relatively lower error e.g. relatively low pixel occlusion relatively low resolution fallout etc. . In another example a second transition zone is defined within the transition space based upon one or more second translated views being above the error threshold within the error basin. The second transition zone may specify a second translated view experience for the one or more second translated views. For example a user may have restricted navigation between the one or more second translated views because such views may be generated with relatively higher error e.g. a current view may be transitioned back to the first transition zone during a navigation pause . In this way an interactive navigation experience of the scene e.g. represented by the visualization may be provided. During navigation within the visualization the user experience may be dynamically defined based upon such transition zones.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are generally used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide an understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

An embodiment of defining transition zones for navigating a visualization is illustrated by an exemplary method of . At the method starts. In an example a visualization interface may generate a visualization by rendering a scene using imagery e.g. texture images depicting a scene of a renovated kitchen from various viewpoints and geometry e.g. a representation of a multi dimensional surface of the scene . The geometry may comprise global geometry e.g. a representation of the entire scene as viewed by texture images depicting the scene or local geometry e.g. a representation of a portion of the scene which may correspond to portions of the scene viewed by one or more texture images . The visualization interface may allow a user to navigate within the visualization to explore the scene e.g. a user may navigate around the visualization in three dimensions to see various views of the scene . In an example a current view provided by the visualization interface may correspond to a single texture image such that the current view is derived from the single texture image e.g. the current view and the single texture image have a one to one correspondence . In another example a current view may correspond to a view that is not entirely depicted by a single texture image and thus one or more texture images may be projected onto a geometry to create textured geometry that may be used to derive the current view e.g. a first portion of the current view is depicted by a first texture image and a second portion of the current view is depicted by a second texture image . A lack of image data inaccurate geometry moving objects within the scene during image capture and or other issues can result in a relatively unsatisfactory user experience when navigating the visualization e.g. seam lines resolution fallout blurring etc. may occur when a current view corresponds to textured geometry as opposed to a single texture image .

Accordingly one or more transition zones for navigating the visualization may be defined. A transition zone may specify a translated view experience that may define how a user may navigate within the visualization e.g. navigation may be relatively restricted when a current view is derived from a transition zone having a relatively higher error which may otherwise result in poor visual quality for the current view . At a first texture image and a second texture image e.g. a panorama image a photo image a computer generated image an orthographic image from an aerial viewpoint etc. are projected onto a geometry of a scene to create textured geometry of the scene e.g. projected onto a global geometry or a local geometry shared by the first texture image and the second texture image . For example the geometry may correspond to a multi dimensional surface of a renovated kitchen. The first texture image the second texture image and or other texture images may depict the renovated kitchen from various views. Because the geometry may initially lack texture information such as color information the first texture image and the second texture image may be projected onto the geometry to texture the geometry e.g. assign color values to geometry pixels of the geometry . In an example the textured geometry may be used to generate a current view of the scene represented by the textured geometry e.g. the first texture image may depict a first portion of the current view and the second texture image may depict a second portion of the current view such that the current view can be constructed from the projection of both the first texture image and the second texture image onto the geometry .

At an error basin for a transition space between the first texture image and the second texture image may be determined based upon a visual error measurement. The error basin may correspond to estimated error that may occur when generating translated views between the first texture image and the second texture image e.g. a translated view that is derived from the textured geometry as opposed to a single texture image . In an example the error basin may be derived from image features extracted from the first texture image and or the second texture image. In another example the error basin may be derived from an inaccurate geometry measurement e.g. the textured geometry used to create the translated view may have inaccuracies based upon a lack of dimensional information used to construct the geometry a resolution fallout measurement e.g. areas of relatively low resolution due to a lack of data a pixel occlusion measurement e.g. a geometry pixel of the geometry may not be depicted by either the first texture image or the second texture image and thus the geometry pixel may not have an accurate color value a color difference measurement e.g. the first texture image may provide a first color for a region of the scene based upon a person standing in that region while the second texture image may provide a second color for the region based upon the person having moved out of the region or other visual error measurements.

In an example the error basin may indicate that translated views that are relatively close to the first texture image or the second texture image may have relatively lower error. For example where the first texture image depicts a northern wall of a renovated kitchen a translated view corresponding to a slightly offset view of the northern wall may have a relatively lower visual error because the first texture image may adequately depict the slightly offset view of the northern wall. In another example the error basin may specify that translated views that are relatively further away from the first texture image and the second texture image may have relatively higher error. For example where the first texture image depicts the northern wall and the second texture image depicts a southern wall a translated view corresponding to an eastern wall may have a relatively higher visual error because the eastern wall may not be adequately depicted by the first texture image and or the second texture image.

In some embodiments a graph may be generated e.g. . The graph may represent one or more texture images available to texture the geometry and may be navigated when generating a current view to display through the visualization interface. For example the graph comprises a first node representing the first texture image a second node representing the second texture image and or other nodes representing other texture images. In an example when a current view corresponds to the first node then the current view is generated based upon the first texture image. The graph may comprise a transitional edge between the first node and the second node. The transitional edge may correspond to the transition space between the first texture image and the second texture image e.g. points along the transitional edge may correspond to translated views derived from the textured geometry textured by the first texture image and or the second texture image . In an example of determining the error basin a first image feature of a first rendered view e.g. derived from the textured geometry of the scene at a first point along the transitional edge may be obtained. A second image feature of a second rendered view e.g. derived from the textured geometry of the scene at a second point along the transitional edge may be obtained. A visual error measurement may be determined based upon comparing the first image feature of the first rendered view to the second image feature of the second rendered view e.g. a color similarity comparison .

One or more transition zones within the transition space may be defined. It may be appreciated that in one example the transition space may correspond to a multi dimensional space that may represent translated views between a plurality of texture images and that merely a transitional space between the first texture image and the second texture image is described for simplicity. At a first transition zone may be defined within the transition space based upon one or more first translated views being below an error threshold within the error basin. The first transition zone may define a first translated view experience for the one or more first translated views e.g. a user may freely navigate within the one or more first translated views through the visualization using unrestricted navigation movement . In an example a first translated view may correspond to a stove area of the renovated kitchen. The first translated view may have a relatively lower error within the error basin because the first texture image depicts a substantial portion of the stove area and thus the first translated view may be accurately generated from the first texture image and or other texture images e.g. the textured geometry .

At a second transition zone may be defined within the transition space based upon one or more second translated views being above the error threshold within the error basin. The second transition zone may define a second translated view experience for the one or more second translated views. The second translated view experience may specify restricted navigation movement for the one or more second translated views within the second transition zone. In an example the restricted navigation movement may correspond to a snapback force from a current view position to a current view derived from at least one of the first texture image the second texture image or the first transition zone. For example the user may attempt to navigate the visualization towards a ceiling of the renovated kitchen which may be derived from a second translated view within the second transition zone. When a user pauses navigational movement a snapback force e.g. a subtle transitional pull may be applied to transition the current view from the ceiling towards an area depicted by a texture image e.g. the stove area depicted by the first texture image or the first transitional zone. In this way an interactive navigation experience of the scene through the visualization may be provided by one or more current views e.g. a view of the scene currently provided by the visualization interface such that navigation within the visualization may be defined based upon one or more transition zones. At the method ends.

The error estimation component may be configured to determine the error basin for a transition space between the first texture image and the second texture image . In particular the error estimation component is configured to project the first texture image and the second texture image onto the geometry to create textured geometry. The transition space may correspond to a portion of the textured geometry that is not entirely depicted by either the first texture image nor entirely depicted by the second texture image . The error estimate component may determine the error basin for the transition space based upon a visual error measurement e.g. a visual error between features of translated views between the first texture image and the second texture image an accurate geometry measurement a resolution fallout measurement a pixel occlusion measurement a color difference measurement etc. .

The zone definition component may be configured to define one or more transition zones for navigating the visualization based upon the error basin as illustrated in example of . It may be appreciated that in one example navigation of the visualization may correspond to multi dimensional navigation such as three dimensional navigation and that merely one dimensional and or two dimensional navigation are illustrated for simplicity. It may be appreciated that in one example a transition zone may represent multi dimensional navigation such as three dimensional navigation within the visualization and that merely a two dimensional transition zone is illustrated for simplicity. In an example the zone definition component may define a first transition zone within which a virtual camera may transition through the scene as a rendering viewpoint to generate one or more current views of the scene. The first transition zone may be defined based upon one or more first translated views being below an error threshold within the error basin e.g. a first translated view of the cloud the tree the sun and the building e.g. where a first side of the building was facing the first camera and the second camera that respectively acquired the first texture image and the second texture image may have a relatively lower visual error because both the first texture image and the second texture image depict the first translated view . The first transition zone may specify a first translated view experience e.g. unrestricted multi dimensional navigation movement e.g. as viewed through virtual camera . For example a user may freely navigate and or pause within the first transition zone while exploring the visualization .

The zone definition component may define a second transition zone within which the virtual camera may transition through the scene as a rendering viewpoint to generate one or more current views of the scene. The second transition zone may be defined based upon one or more second translated views being above the error threshold within the error basin e.g. a second translated view comprising a second side of the building may have a relatively higher visual error because the second side of the building is merely depicted by the second texture image and or was not directly facing the second camera that acquired the second texture image . The second transition zone may specify a second translated view experience e.g. restricted multi dimensional navigation movement . For example a user may navigate within the second transition zone . However responsive to a navigation pause a current view position within the second transition zone may be transitioned back to a current view associated with the first texture image the second texture image and or the first transition zone . It will be appreciated that the zone definition component may define one or more additional transition zones such as a third transition zone defining a third translated view experience e.g. a snapback force may be applied during active navigation and or a navigation pause e.g. a view through virtual camera may be not be available . In an example the third transition zone may be associated with a relatively strong snapback force for example because a backside of the building is merely depicted by the second texture image and or there may be a relatively sparse amount of data available for the backside of the building because the backside of the building may be materially occluded by the first side of the building when the second texture image was acquired by the second camera e.g. given the orientation of the second camera to the building when the second texture image was acquired . Accordingly there may be a relatively high degree of error associated with the third transition zone as interpolation filling etc. may be employed to populate the third transition zone . Given the relatively high degree of error sparse data available and or limited user experience resulting therefrom in the third transition zone user navigation within the third transition zone may be substantially constrained for example.

In some embodiments the graph component is configured to generate a second graph based upon one or more texture images depicting a scene from various viewpoints as illustrated by example of . The second graph comprises one or more nodes connected by one or more transitional edges where a node represents a texture image. Because at least some of the nodes overlap e.g. a first texture image depicts a stove area and a refrigerator area of a renovated kitchen and a second texture image depicts the stove area and an island area of the renovated kitchen transitional space corresponding to overlapping portions may have relatively lower error because multiple texture images may depict portions of the scene. Transitional space corresponding to non overlapping portions may have relatively higher error because some portions of the scene may not be depicted or may be merely depicted by a single texture image. Thus an error basin may have relatively higher error estimates for transitional space corresponding to non overlapping portions and relatively lower error estimates for transitional space corresponding to overlapping portions.

In some embodiments the graph component is configured to generate a third graph based upon one or more texture images depicting a scene from various viewpoints as illustrated by example of . The third graph comprises one or more nodes connected by one or more transitional edges where a node represents a texture image. Because the one or more nodes overlap transitional space along the one or more transitional edges may have relatively lower error because multiple texture images may depict portions of the scene. Thus an error basin may have relatively lower error estimates for transitional space corresponding to the overlapping portions.

The confidence mask component may be configured to generate a confidence mask comprising one or more pixel confidences. In an example the confidence mask is generated based upon image features inaccurate geometry measurements resolution fallout measurements pixel occlusion measurements color difference measurements and or other image information. In an example a first pixel confidence may be generated for a first geometry pixel of a geometry representing a multi dimensional surface of a scene. The first pixel confidence may specify a confidence that an object e.g. a portion of a cloud corresponding to the first geometry pixel is represented in both a first texture image and a second texture image . Responsive to the first pixel confidence being below a confidence threshold the confidence mask component may determine that the first geometry pixel corresponds to a transient occluder e.g. the cloud may be present in the first texture image but not in the second texture image . In an example the confidence mask component may modify the first geometry pixel based upon a blending technique an inpaint technique a shading technique a fadeout technique and or other techniques to compensate for the transient occluder .

An embodiment of filling an untextured visualization portion of a visualization is illustrated by an exemplary method of . At the method starts. At one or more texture images may be projected onto a geometry a scene to create a textured geometry of the scene. For example the geometry may represent a multi dimensional surface of the scene depicted by the one or more texture images. The one or more texture images may be projected onto the geometry to assign texture such as color values to geometry pixels of the geometry. Because the one or more texture images may not depict every portion of the scene e.g. a rooftop of a building may not be depicted or seen by by one or more textured images depicting the building and an outdoor space the textured geometry may comprise an untextured geometry portion that is not depicted by at least one texture image.

At a visualization of the scene may be generated based upon the textured geometry. The visualization may comprise an untextured visualization portion corresponding to the untextured geometry portion e.g. the untextured visualization portion may correspond to a portion of the scene for which relatively minimal to no image data is available . At the untextured visualization portion may be filled e.g. textured or inpainted . In an example low resolution imagery depicting the portion of the scene corresponding to the unextured visualization portion may be used to inpaint the untextured visualization portion with relatively low resolution image information. In another example a neighboring pixel region may be expanded to visually cover at least a portion of the untextured visualization portion e.g. multiple neighboring pixel regions may be expanded to visually cover all or substantially all of the untextured visualization portion . In another example a circular e.g. or other shaped image transition window may be displayed e.g. to visually cover at least a portion of the untextured visualization portion . The circular image transition window may be configured to transition a current view of the scene to a texture image e.g. a texture image depicting the neighboring pixel region . In one example the circular image transition window may be displayed while the visualization is in an overview mode e.g. a zoomed out state . In another example the circular image transition window may be displayed during other modes such as regular viewing modes to indicate where additional imagery of the scene e.g. the texture image may be available e.g. a user may be able to jump from a first street side bubble to a second street side bubble utilizing the circular image transition window .
