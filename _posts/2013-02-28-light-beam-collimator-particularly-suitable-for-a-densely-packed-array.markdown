title: Light beam collimator particularly suitable for a densely packed array
abstract: A method and apparatus for controlled displacement, rotation and deformation of parts of a fiber optic collimator so as to provide multiple degrees of adjustment freedom that are decoupled one from another, for adjusting the path of a light beam, comprising: an output elongate hollow node for passing a light beam therethrough and towards a lens, and an elongate hollow base node having separate top and bottom parts connected to each other by opposed ends of a plurality of flexible rods that restrict the relative movement between the top and bottom parts of the base node to substantially only translational parallel movement. Opposed portions of the top and bottom parts of the base node each include a respective screw and an opposed slanted surface, which upon interaction, develop a shearing force which is applied to the top and bottom parts of the base node and cause a translational parallel relative movement therebetween.

Governmental Interest The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.

Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to a light beam collimator and more particularly to a method and apparatus for adjustably positioning an optical fiber therein that supplies a light beam where sequentially coupled mechanical portions of the collimator provide axial alignment adjustability of the light beam within the collimator in a manner such that the adjustments are substantially decoupled one from another and where the collimator is particularly suitable for mounting in a densely packed array. Suitability of the collimator for mounting in a densely packed array is provided by having simple rotation mechanisms for complete control of the alignment adjustability which rotation mechanisms are all accessible at the perimeter of the collimator.

An optical fiber is typically used to transmit coherent monochromatic light which is emitted from an output end of the optical fiber hereinafter called the emitting tip. Such optical fibers typically have an active core diameter of about 6 20 microns in the case of a single mode fiber. A fiber optic collimator is a common optical node found in many places in the modern fiber optic industry. The collimator is a device which holds in an adjustable manner the emitting tip of the optical fiber so that it is positionable in multiple axes near the focus of a lens so as to provide at the output of the lens collimator a parallel collimated laser beam. Such positionability is typically expressed as an adjustability with multiple degrees of freedom such as plus and minus translation in X Y and Z linear axes Rotation about the longitudinal axis of the collimator and Tilt of the emitting tip of the optical fiber hereinafter called Tip Tilt leading to a requirement of having multiple degrees of freedom preferably nine each degree of freedom decoupled from the other for establishing a precise alignment of multiple collimators in an array.

The position of the emitting tip relative to the lens focus point strongly influences the beam parameters. For example a negative displacement of the tip along the longitudinal axis of the collimator leads to convergence focusing of the beam as shown by the arrows adjacent beam in while a positive displacement of the tip along the longitudinal axis of the collimator leads to divergence de focusing of the beam as shown by the arrows adjacent beam in .

A tilt of the fiber optic cable as noted above called a Tip Tilt or an equivalent effect caused by deviation of beam propagation relative to an angled cleaving of the emitting tip leads to a perpendicular displacement delta of the beam centroid from the optical center of lens as shown by the arrow adjacent beam in . The effect of such displacement is that the maximum intensity of Gaussian shaped divergent beam no longer coincides with the center of lens thereby decreasing the fill factor and quality of the collimated laser beam .

A lateral shift of the emitting tip relative to the focal plane of lens by an amount delta Y as shown in induces an angular deviation of the output beam which can easily result in missing a target or receiver area that is located at a remote distance from lens .

From the above it should be clear that the ability of precisely control adjustment of the position of the emitting tip in the collimator is an essential requirement for a collimator For example at an aperture lens diameter of 30 mm and a focal length of 150 mm a diffraction limited target 3 cm at a distance of 1000 m will be totally missed if the emitting tip in the collimator is displaced by only 5 microns from the focus of the lens.

Numerous mechanical controlling stages like X Y Z or tip tilt rotation nodes have been developed in the fiber optic industry to provide precision control of the position and orientation of a fiber node that supports therein the fiber emitting tip. Such mechanical devices are typically supplied with micrometers as well as with stepping motors and servo motors so as to allow precise manual or computerized alignment of the node that holds the fiber optic emitting tip and other parameters of the collimator for alignment in the X Y and Z directions of the tip as well as its rotational position relative to the lens focal point in the controlling stage. Computerized alignment is particularly important in view of the fact that existing fiber optic controlling stages typically require iterative adjustment since adjustment along one axis typically affects to some degree alignment in another axes that is such adjustments heretofore have not been decoupled one from the other.

Thus existing alignment controlling stages are bulky and require a lot of space to provide the necessary stiffness and accuracy to enable such precise control and as rioted above have adjustments that are somewhat coupled one to the other in that adjustment of one alignment stage disadvantageously affects the alignment of another stage. Thus in combination with the controlling stages the physical space taken up by a collimator extends substantially beyond the perimeter required for transmitting just the light beam. Advanced optical systems such as systems requiring more power however may require more than use of a single fiber optic collimator and therefore an array of collimators mounted so as to be in close proximity and parallel to each other is also highly desirable. For example illustrates coherent laser beam combining in a sparse aperture array design that requires dense packing within a mount of a plurality of collimators such as the seven fiber optic collimators shown. Arrays having even more fiber optic collimators would be desirable.

However the density of packing is among the most difficult requirements to meet for achieving the highest optical performance in a fiber optic collimator array The array may have standard fiber optic ferrules with static positioning of the fiber outputs or may have fast responding fiber positioners with high frequency bandwidth providing computer controlled compensation of deviations of separate beams from the target induced with vibrations or and optical turbulences in a propagation media e.g. atmosphere .

The physical closeness of the collimators to each other in a densely packed array of collimators makes alignment of the separate fiber outputs in a common mount a complicated task. This is due to the spatial requirement of the need for sufficient access to a means used for adjustment of the alignment provided by each of the collimators. Moreover after an optimum alignment of each collimator in the array is found the alignment should hold that is be very stable under changing environmental conditions such as vibration temperature etc.

One known design for a fiber collimator comprising alignment controlling stages is shown by my prior publication Development of Adaptive Fiber Collimators for Conformal Fiber Based Beam Projection Systems published in the Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 7090 709008 2008 incorporated herein by reference. The mechanical design of the collimator comprises four cylindrical shaped concentric elements or alignment nodes. Although that design functioned according to specifications to provide the necessary controls of alignment alignment was somewhat cumbersome because adjustment of alignment in one or more of the axes via one node was not decoupled from affecting alignment in one or more of any of the other axes in another node.

Therefore there is a need in the art for a method and apparatus for providing a fiber optics collimator having multiple up to nine degrees of freedom to adjust its alignment in a decoupled manner and which is suitable for mounting in a densely packed array. Suitability for mounting in a densely packed array is judged by a reduction in the spatial requirements of the means for adjusting the collimator thereby allowing dense packing and access to the alignment adjustments.

A method and apparatus for a fiber optic collimator as shown in and or described in connection with at least one of the figures as set forth more completely in the claims.

These and other features and advantages of the present disclosure may be appreciated from a review of the following detailed description of the present disclosure along with the accompanying figures in which like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout.

Embodiments of the present invention also relate to an apparatus for providing a fiber optic collimator having multiple degrees of freedom in order to adjust its alignment and which is suitable for mounting in a densely packed array.

Embodiments of the present invention comprise a method and apparatus for providing a fiber optics collimator having multiple such as nine degrees of freedom substantially decoupled one from the other and which is suitable for mounting in a densely packed array. The embodiments of the present invention provide a collimator which enables control and locking of all parameters of the collimated light beam emitted from the tip of the fiber. The present embodiments allow one to construct an array of fiber collimators without restriction of the amount of collimators which can be used and permits alignment of light emitting fiber tips having either of orthogonal or angled cleaving. Adjustment of all degrees of freedom use standard screws as controlling elements without the requirement to use bulky micrometers or motors. Easy access to the controlling screws at the perimeter of each collimator allows one to align the array of collimators using common screwdrivers. Once a final adjustment of all degrees of freedom is set the adjustment can be locked using the same screws thereby providing long term stability of the alignment of the array of collimators as set by the final adjustment.

It is noted that in the following Figures and corresponding description X and Y adjustments are provided in some embodiments by two pairs of orthogonally positioned screws and or their threaded holes and or access slots in some embodiments by two pairs of flexible rods and in other embodiments by two pairs of slanted surfaces where the position of each screw rod or slanted surface of each pair is adjustable in one of the X and Y axial directions. It is to be understood that for completeness sake although in the following description reference will often be made to both pairs of these screws rods and slanted surfaces in the corresponding Figures due to the orthogonal nature of the position of the screws rods and surfaces not all of the screws rods and slanted surfaces will be visible in each Figure or visible at all.

2. A Tip Tilt Z node T T Z node composed from an upper part shown in detail of as well as B and C having regions and and a bottom part having regions and . Parts and are connected to each other through a flexible ring having upper thumbs and and bottom thumbs and . More specifically parts and may initially be formed by a single cylindrical element and upon forming three lateral cuts that extend through the sidewalls of the cylindrical element but which cuts are angularly offset from each other by 120 degrees enough material can be removed from a central cylindrical wall portion of element so as to essentially separate element into upper and lower parts and by leaving only angularly offset thumb portions of material and attached to upper part and thumb portions and attached to lower part . Because the thumbs are the only material left connecting the upper part to the lower part they essentially form the flexible ring . Details of how flexible ring allows for the bending adjustment of node is described below in conjunction with .

3. A lever having a bottom part firmly connected with the bottom part of T T Z node . An upper part of lever is located inside of part in the upper part as shown in and moveable therein to initiate tip tilt adjustments by bending at ring as shown in B and C described in greater detail below.

4. An X Y node composed from parts and where part is firmly seated at the bottom of lever within the bottom part of T T Z node . Parts and are connected with each other via a plurality of flexible rods and so as to allow rotation adjustment as shown in and precisely controlled X and Y lateral adjustment as shown in .

5. A fiber node for holding the fiber optic . The fiber node can comprise a standard fiber connector having normal or angled cleaving PC or APC at the tip end . The node can be a fiber positioner with high frequency bandwidth having a rapidly controlled motion of the fiber tip in focal plane of the lens using for example a piezoelectric actuator known in the art. Fiber node is adjustably held within the lower part of X Y node so as to allow coarsely controlled X Y and Z adjustment as shown in .

The barrel T T Z Lever and X Y nodes all hollow in that they have a central passageway where the light beam travels on its way from the emitting tip from fiber node to the lens .

In accordance with embodiments of the invention controlled displacements rotations and or deformations between the nodes listed above can meet the alignment requirements 1.1 to 1.5 listed below in order to provide a fiber optics collimator having nine degrees of freedom for adjustment of the light beam and which is suitable for mounting in a densely packed array. The suitability being provided by the means for adjusting the alignment being simple rotational mechanisms which are all accessible at the perimeter of the collimator.

1.1 preliminary coarse tip tilt X and Y adjustment of the node within X Y part as shown in and Z adjustment as shown in 

1.3 bending of the T T Z node around point located at the center of the flexible ring as shown in and B and C

1.5 and finally precise X and Y parallel shifting of part relative to the part of X Y node through the S bending of flexible pins and as shown in .

As shown in the general view and more specifically in at least collimating lens is contained in an upper end of barrel A bottom part of barrel contains three sets of holes located in areas and . Two pairs of orthogonally positioned holes and in the area allow access to screws and . Four threaded holes and are located in the area containing four screws and used for locking the node inside of barrel At least one threaded hole is located in the area preferably in between neighbor holes and or and or and or and The hole contains a screw as shown in with a slot for a screwdriver. The screw contains a hole parallel to a rotation axis so as to provide an eccentric shift of a distance r as shown in . A stiff pin is firmly installed into the hole and an exposed end of pin may slide inside of groove of part of node as shown in and . During the rotation of screw the pin enables movement in the range of r thereby providing a displacement of 2r of the T T Z part inside of barrel along the Z axis as shown in .

Lever has upper and bottom ends as also shown in . Bottom end is connected to pail of node by means of screws and in threaded holes and . The screws control the orientation of lever by pushing its flat surfaces . The surfaces form the rectangular arrangement as shown by the top view in . With this arrangement the lever can be deviated relative to the central point located in the central area of the flexible ring as shown in and . The final position of lever can be locked in place with screws by tightening the opposite screws. For example to lock the tilting of lever in the plane of the paper the screws and should both be turned clockwise while the tilting in this plane is accomplished by turning one screw clockwise and the opposite screw counterclockwise and shown in . The controlled tilting of the upper part of lever in the plane of drawing is accompanied with sliding the surfaces and between the screws and of . The deviation of lever activates the deviation of the bottom part of the node together with node and ultimately the deviation of the fiber node with deviation of fiber tip around the point as shown in and .

The X Y node is a particularly important multi functional node where X and Y means displacement of the emitting tip in the X and V directions from the center and means the rotation of the node around the coaxial axis of the fiber at angle Omega . The X and displacements are adjustable both during a preliminary coarse alignment using screws and of part of node shown in and described below with respect to as well as during a final precision alignment using screws and slanted surfaces S to S of parts and respectively of node described below with respect to . The rotation adjustment is described below with respect to . All of these adjustments are able to be performed in a manner that is decoupled one from another.

Such adjustments are extremely important since for example with an output lens having a diameter 30 mm a diffraction limited spot will have a diameter of about 3 cm at a distance of 1 km wavelength 1 mkm . If the focal length of the lens is 15 cm a 3 cm displacement at 1 km will occur when the tip is displaced by only a distance of 5 microns. In order to target the same spot with a collimated beam from a neighbor collimator requires submicron accuracy for the positioning of the tips of the neighbor collimators. Embodiments of the present arrangement provides for such alignment accuracy as well as a resistance to change due to temperature and vibration so as to have long term stability.

For assembly an upper part of node is installed into the bottom part of node . A bottom part of node holds the fiber optic node including the fiber optic therein with emitting tip .

Rotation of node with respect to node and therefore also node allows for adjustability of the polarization plane of the light beam emitted from tip as shown in .

The angular orientation of the node with a selected polarization plane as shown in can be adjusted into a desired position by loosening screws and which can then slide in a groove at upper end of node until a final angular orientation is achieved. Screws keep the node inside of tilting part of T T Z node during such angular alignment and are then tightened so as to lock the angular orientation of node into a fixed alignment with the selected polarization plane .

So as to allow the above noted precision X and V displacements in a manner that is decoupled from other adjustments of the collimator the parts and of the node are connected with each other using stiff but flexible rods and so as to form a three dimensional parallelogram. The flexible rods are flexible in their lateral axis but not flexible along their longitudinal axis. Because of the flexible rod connection the bottom part containing parts and where part holds the fiber node can only be moved in a manner that is parallel to the part such movement occurring in accordance with the illustrated embodiment when shearing force is applied to part relative to part as shown in . To accomplish precision X shift shifting to the right in the plane of the drawing shearing force is applied by interaction of screws and in threaded holes of part with slanted surfaces S and S of solid legs and in an area of part . Rotation of screws and in opposite directions counterclockwise and clockwise respectively as shown in leads to climbing of screw on surface S and pulling the part to the right against S bending of rods . The final locking of the position of part together with part and fiber node can be accomplished by tightening the screws and by turning both screws clockwise. During the X shift the screws and which are used for controlling the Y shift in a manner similar to that described above or screws and for controlling the X shift are sliding on inclined surfaces S and S which surfaces are visible in Part remains parallel to part during X shifting as a result of the property of parallelogram s and the fiber node maintains the orientation of long axis and the Z orientation of the fiber as a result of the decoupling of these adjustments. Accordingly the resulting X shift placement X of the fiber tip occurs without tilting or focusing defocusing of the collimated beam . The divergent beam moves to the right and the collimated beam deviates counterclockwise as shown in principle in and more specifically in .

The precision of the X or Y displacement can be optimized by variation of the slanting angle of surfaces S S. The less the angle between planes of slanted surfaces S and S and the Z axis of the collimator the higher the sensitivity of the X Y displacements caused by rotation of screws . With the present arrangement the desired submicron accuracy for the positioning of tip is possible.

For increased deviation of part relative to part a second flexible ring not shown similar to flexible ring can be added in between parts and the second flexible ring having corresponding thumbs.

The T T Z node can be fabricated from one piece of stiff metal steel titanium stainless steel etc. and a slitting saw can be used for cutting the slots between part and and between parts and thereby forming the flexible ring and thumbs and .

The upper part of T T Z node is installed into a bottom portion of the barrel as shown in and . The outer diameter of part is slightly less than the inner diameter of the bottom portion of part thereby allowing part to slide along a central axis Z axis within barrel . The movement of part along the Z axis is caused by stiff rod of the Z screw shown in and . This rod mates with a horizontal groove on the outer cylinder surface of part . The vertical displacement of rod is controlled by rotation of the screw by means of a screwdriver such as W shown in described below. Thus the screwdriver W uses the slot on the screw to cause alignment adjustability of part and all parts connected thereto along the Z axis.

Upper screws may slide in slots of barrel to help ensure controlled movement of part as also shown in and . That is grooves of part may slide along screws of barrel as shown in restricting the mutual rotations of barrel and T T Z node . The optimum Z position of part relative to the part can be locked with screws by tightening these screws as shown by .

The screws in bottom area of part of T T Z node are used to lock the bottom part of lever at the area of dimples of of lever . The lever in combination with bottom part is then able to be deviated with respect to top part by use of screws which forces the deviation of part relative to the part so as to provide control of tip tilt alignment as shown in . The screws shown in at the bottom part of T T Z node are used to lock the angle of Omega rotation of the node relative to the Z axis in node as shown in .

The number of threaded holes and screws on levels and can be two or more as shown in and A and B. The preferable amount of screws to use is three or four.

The amount of screws on level as shown in and is four two pairs for providing the tip and tilt deviations of part relative to part and for locking the deviations once the desired adjustment is made.

The amount of longitudinal grooves can be two or more preferably four along with screws and four holes on each level and for simplicity of fabrication .

The slot in part can be a straight groove as it is shown in . In an alternative embodiment slot can be replaced with a he circular groove having a rectangular profile fabricated as well on the cylinder surface of part not specifically shown.

Alignment of the Fiber Tip Near the Rotation Point for Tip Tilt Deviations a First Step in an Alignment Procedure for the Present Arrangement and Providing Adjustment of Three Degrees of Freedom x y z 

Alignment of Tip Tilt of Fiber Tip Relative to the Rotation Point a Third Step in an Alignment Procedure for the Present Arrangement and Providing Adjustment of Fifth and Sixth Degrees of Freedom

In this step the divergent beam is adjusted so as to hit the lens with optimized filling efficiency. The maximum intensity of of the Gaussian beam should coincide precisely with the center of lens . Upon such coincidence we get the best practical efficiency by using the most powerful central fraction of Gaussian beam typically 90 efficiency. As shown in the screw pushes the lever at a flat surface of lever . In response the lever deviates around point in conjunction with deformation of flexible ring . The upper surfaces of thumbs and are connected to the bottom part of node and the lower surfaces of thumbs and are connected to the upper surface of the flexible ring . The thumbs and connect the bottom surface of flexible ring with the top surface of part of node . When screw is rotated so as to move to the right synchronously with a corresponding rotation of screw lever deviates a corresponding amount to the right as shown in . After alignment of the beam centroid in the central area of lens aperture both screws and should be tightened so as to provide a stiff coupling of parts and .

During deviation of lever to the right the parallel surfaces and slide between screws and responsible for tip tilt deviation of lever in the perpendicular direction.

To control the deviation of lever in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the drawings screws and should move synchronously in the same direction that is in a manner similar to that described for movement of screws and . The parallel surfaces and of the lever will slide between screws and .

Alignment of the Z Axis Position for focus Control a Fourth Step in an Alignment Procedure for the Present Arrangement and Providing Adjustment of a Seventh Degree of Freedom

The goal of focus control alignment is to establish a parallel output beam that is neither convergent nor divergent. illustrates assembly of the barrel with the T T Z node . is an outside view of the assembly and are inside views showing focus control and de focus control respectively. Recall that screw contains the eccentric rod for shifting a distance r upon rotation of screw on its rotation axis . The node has a groove cut over a part of the cylindrical surface of node or over the circumference of the cylindrical surface as shown in . The depth of the groove is dimensioned to accommodate the rod . The width of the groove allows the rod to smoothly slide in the groove . The node can be moved along the Z axis a total distance in the Z direction equal to 2r upon rotation of the screw by 180 around rotation axis .

The screws only one screw is shown of four evenly located screws having 90 angular spacing slide in longitudinal grooves . In only one groove is shown. In other longitudinal grooves and are visible. Screws shown in prevent the rotation of node about its main axis of symmetry. Screws are tightened after focus defocused alignment as shown in . The part of node may contain additional longitudinal grooves and node may contain corresponding additional screws so as to enhance the stiffness of the aligned assembly .

Precision Control of the X Y Position of the Fiber Tip a Fifth Step in an Alignment Procedure for the Present Arrangement and Providing Adjustment of Eighth and Ninth Degrees of Freedom

As previously noted in order to target the same spot with the collimated beam from neighbor collimators requires submicron accuracy for the positioning of tip . Embodiments of the present arrangement provides for such alignment accuracy as well as the ability to hold the accuracy under harsh temperature and vibration conditions so as to provide long term stability.

In the described device after alignment in accordance with the adjustments noted above the output lens is solidly tightened with the element through the chain of nodes and elements screws shown in . The fiber tip is solidly tightened to the element through the set of elements screws as also shown in . With the above adjustments the fiber tip is able to be fairly accurately positioned at point however even better accuracy is desired 

Thus in accordance with this fifth step in the alignment procedure shown in parallel displacement of the node relative to the node provides a very precise displacement of for example X of the fiber tip near the point . As noted above the nodes and are connected with each other in a parallelogram configuration by means of flexible rods so as to assure only parallel displacement is possible between nodes and .

During the displacement of X the rods S bend so as to keep the shift of the node parallel relative to the shift of the node .

The node contains four solid legs with slanting surfaces S to S shown in for precisely controlling the parallel displacement. More specifically the node contains four threaded holes with screws having a cone like shape on top and slots for causing rotation of screws using a screwdriver such as W and W shown in . The slanted plane surfaces S and S of opposite legs and have an imaginary intersection with each other on a line ILthat extends perpendicular to the plane of the drawing as shown at the bottom of . The slanted plane surfaces S and S of opposite legs and have an imaginary crossing with each other on a line IL not shown which would be parallel to the plane of the drawing.

The illustrated shift X positive of the node to the right relative to the node is accomplished by the simultaneous rotation of the screw clockwise and of screw counterclockwise as shown in . The slanting surface S allows the screw to pull the node to the right X positive owing to the upward climbing of screw . The counterclockwise rotation of screw allows the node to move to the right due to slanting of surface S of leg . The shift of the node to the left X negative is accomplished by clockwise rotation of screw and counterclockwise rotation of screw .

A Y shift of the node relative to the node that is in a direction perpendicular to the plane of is done in a similar manner as described above with respect to accomplishing a X shift however it is accomplished by the simultaneous rotation of the screws and Screw visible in slide over surfaces S visible in of legs and respectively during such X shift.

During the displacement of node perpendicular to the plane of the drawing the screws and slide over the surfaces S and S of legs and . After the location is found for tip the screws are tightened so as to provide a permanent locking of the X Y position of the node relative to the node and hence the permanent positioning of fiber tip relative to the point .

Compensation for Deviation of a Beam Emitted from a Fiber Tip having Angled Cleaving an Additional Step in an Alignment Procedure for the Present Arrangement

Allen wrenches W and W control the screws used for aligning the divergent beams in the center of each output lenses and then locking these screws after alignment as described with respect to step three of the alignment procedure. Hex screwdrivers W and W provide for precision displacement of the fiber tip in the X and V directions by means of rotation of screws as described with respect to step five of the alignment procedure.

If necessary two screwdrivers responsible for Y displacement of the same collimator can be kept attached to the corresponding pair of screws and until the XV alignment process of the selected collimator is complete. The final location of fiber tip can be locked at any position by tightening the opposite screws e.g. and .

The optic um alignment of beam centroids to the apertures of the lenses can be accomplished with hex screwdrivers W and W which as shown in turn the screws and provide the necessary tip tilt compensation of the beam deviations in a manner similar to that described with respect to step three of the alignment procedure. It is also seen that the illustrated embodiment provides easy access using hex or socket screwdrivers to other screws used for aligning the necessary degrees of freedom in a densely packed array as described above when using collimators constructed in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.

Although the lens is required to be a fixed distance from the reference point it is not required that the fixed distance result in the lens being positioned exactly at the top end of barrel as in the above described embodiments in order to utilize the adjustment mechanism of the invention and thus in an alternative embodiment the lens can be located a fixed distance therefrom.

Accordingly illustrates a modular design for an array of collimators having an alternative construction to the collimators shown in where here a collimator holder also called a unified platform is used to decouple the collimator lenses from direct attachment at the output of each collimator in the array.

An arrangement accordance with this alternative embodiment is useful when a large number of collimators are to be densely packed in an array and the body containing the collimators can itself be too large bulky and heavy for all of the collimators to be mounted in the array. The fill factor of output lenses roughly proportional to the ratio of the lens aperture to the distance between the centers of neighbor lenses can significantly restrict the requirements for the dimensions of part of the barrel in order to provide the stiff reliable and precise attachment of collimators to the body of the array and thus lead to use of this alternative embodiment of .

Accordingly the modular design of is provided where the lenses of each collimator are separated from their barrels and placed on a unified platform so as to form a lens holder node . The collimators are attached to their own holder or body using for example simple holes in holder to accommodate the lens free part of barrels . In this case the fill factor for output sub apertures is not restricted by the dimension of part occupying the periphery areas of Gaussian beams . Accordingly a lens holder in this alternative embodiment is shown attached to the body by means of thick rods position outside of the lens area thereby providing a stiff and reliable alignment of the lenses relative to the body with attached collimators. The alignment accuracy of body and lens holder is of modest requirements because the final alignment of fiber tips in the focuses of lenses can be accomplished by means of the above described collimator adjustments having nine degrees of freedom.

The free space between lens holder and body in the modular design also allows one to embed sensors used for power and or polarization sensing of beams for computerized feedback control of beam parameters as well as to embed a means intercepting and dissipating parasitic portions of laser beam power.
