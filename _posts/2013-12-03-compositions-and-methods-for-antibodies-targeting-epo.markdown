Diabetic retinopathy DR is the most common complication in patients with diabetes. Diabetic macular edema DME can occur in any stage of DR and is the main cause of vision loss in patients with DR. The incidence of DME after 10 years of follow up has been reported to be 20.1 in Type 1 diabetes 25.4 in Type 2 insulin dependent diabetes and 13.9 in Type 2 non insulin dependent diabetes Klein et al. 1995 Ophthalmology 102 7 16 . The ETDRS trial 1985 Photocoagulation for Diabetic Macular Edema Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Report 0.1. Archives of Ophthalmology 103 1796 1806 a pioneering study in DR demonstrated that although laser photocoagulation therapy reduces the risk of moderate visual loss in DME eyes by 50 at 3 years only a few eyes gain vision and some eyes continue to experience vision loss even after intensive treatment. In recent years advances in pharmacotherapy and ocular drug delivery have shown promise in the treatment of DME. The RESTORE study one of two pivotal Phase III trials in DME Mitchell et al. 2011 Ophthalmology 118 615 625 demonstrated that Lucentis was superior to laser monotherapy. The mean change in best corrected visual acuity BCVA which was the primary clinical endpoint was significantly improved in the Lucentis group 6.1 letters for the Lucentis group vs. 0.8 letters for the laser group p

Despite these new treatment options for DME there remains a substantial unmet medical need. 25 of eyes in the Lucentis pivotal trials did not gain any visual acuity after 12 months of treatment and 50 of eyes are left with visual acuity of 20 40 or worse. Genome wide association studies indicated that diabetics who are homozygous for an erythropoietin Epo promoter polymorphism T have a 2.17 fold higher risk of developing proliferative DR Tong et al. 2008 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A 105 6998 7003 . Interestingly people with the T promoter allele for Epo have approximately 7.5 fold higher vitreal concentration of Epo compared to people with the G allele Tong et al. 2008 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A 105 6998 7003 .

Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs arranged from amino terminus to carboxy terminus in the following order FR1 CDR1 FR2 CDR2 FR3 CDR3 FR4. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors including various cells of the immune system e.g. effector cells and the first component Clq of the classical complement system.

The term antigen binding portion or antigen binding fragment of an antibody as used herein refers to one or more fragments of an intact antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to a given antigen e.g. Erythropoietin Epo . Antigen binding functions of an antibody can be performed by fragments of an intact antibody. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term antigen binding portion or antigen binding fragment of an antibody include a Fab fragment a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL VH CL and CH1 domains a F ab fragment a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region an Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains an Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody a single domain antibody dAb fragment Ward et al. 1989 Nature 341 544 546 which consists of a VH domain or a VL domain and an isolated complementarity determining region CDR .

Furthermore although the two domains of the Fv fragment VL and VH are coded for by separate genes they can be joined using recombinant methods by an artificial peptide linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules known as single chain Fv scFv see e.g. Bird et al. 1988 Science 242 423 426 and Huston et al. 1988 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 85 5879 5883 . Such single chain antibodies include one or more antigen binding portions or fragments of an antibody. These antibody fragments are obtained using conventional techniques known to those of skill in the art and the fragments are screened for utility in the same manner as are intact antibodies.

Antigen binding fragments can also be incorporated into single domain antibodies maxibodies minibodies intrabodies diabodies triabodies tetrabodies v NAR and bis scFv see e.g. Hollinger and Hudson 2005 Nature Biotechnology 23 9 1126 1136 . Antigen binding portions of antibodies can be grafted into scaffolds based on polypeptides such as Fibronectin type III Fn3 see U.S. Pat. No. 6 703 199 which describes fibronectin polypeptide monobodies .

Antigen binding fragments can be incorporated into single chain molecules comprising a pair of tandem Fv segments VH CH1 VH CH1 which together with complementary light chain polypeptides form a pair of antigen binding regions Zapata et al. 1995 Protein Eng. 8 10 1057 1062 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 870 .

As used herein the term affinity refers to the strength of interaction between antibody and antigen at single antigenic sites. Within each antigenic site the variable region of the antibody arm interacts through weak non covalent forces with antigen at numerous sites the more interactions the stronger the affinity. As used herein the term high affinity for an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof e.g. a Fab fragment generally refers to an antibody or antigen binding fragment having a KD of 10M or less.

The term amino acid refers to naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids as well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function in a manner similar to the naturally occurring amino acids. Naturally occurring amino acids are those encoded by the genetic code as well as those amino acids that are later modified e.g. hydroxyproline carboxyglutamate and O phosphoserine. Amino acid analogs refer to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid i.e. an alpha carbon that is bound to a hydrogen a carboxyl group an amino group and an R group e.g. homoserine norleucine methionine sulfoxide methionine methyl sulfonium. Such analogs have modified R groups e.g. norleucine or modified peptide backbones but retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid. Amino acid mimetics refers to chemical compounds that have a structure that is different from the general chemical structure of an amino acid but that functions in a manner similar to a naturally occurring amino acid.

The term binding specificity as used herein refers to the ability of an individual antibody combining site to react with only one antigenic determinant.

The phrase specifically or selectively binds to an antibody e.g. an Epo binding antibody refers to a binding reaction that is determinative of the presence of a cognate antigen e.g. a human Epo or cynomolgus Epo in a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologics. The phrases an antibody recognizing an antigen and an antibody specific for an antigen are used interchangeably herein with the term an antibody which binds specifically to an antigen .

The term condition or disorder associated with retinal vascular disease refers to conditions disorders or diseases in which the retina degenerates or becomes dysfunctional. This includes diabetic retinopathy DR diabetic macular edema DME proliferative diabetic retinopathy PDR non proliferative diabetic retinopathy NPDR age related macular degeneration AMD retinal vein occlusion RVO multifocal choroiditis myopic choroidal neovascularization or retinopathy of prematurity. Anatomic characteristics of retinal vascular disease that may be treated by Epo inhibition include macular edema venous dilation vessel tortuosity vascular leakage as measured by fluorescein angiography retinal hemorrhage and microvascular anomalies e.g. microaneurysm cotton wool spots IRMA capillary dropout leukocyte adhesion retinal ischemia neovascularization of the optic disk neovascularization of the posterior pole iris neovascularization intraretinal hemorrhage vitreous hemorrhage macular scar subretinal fibrosis and retinal fibrosis.

The term condition or disorder associated with diabetic retinopathy refers to conditions in which the retina degenerates or becomes dysfunctional as a consequence of effects of diabetes mellitus Type 1 or Type 2 on retinal vasculature retinal metabolism retinal pigment epithelium the blood retinal barrier or ocular levels of advanced glycation end products AGEs aldose reductase activity glycosylated hemoglobin and protein kinase C. Visual loss in patients with diabetic retinopathy can be a result of retinal ischemia macular edema vascular leakage vitreous hemorrhage or direct effects of elevated glucose levels on retinal neurons. Anatomic characteristics of diabetic retinopathy that may be treated by Epo inhibition include microaneurysm cotton wool spots venous dilation macular edema intra retinal microvascular abnormalities IRMA intra retinal hemorrhage vascular proliferation neovascularization of the disk rubeosis and retinal ischemia. Diabetic macular edema occurs in a subject with diabetic retinopathy and can occur at any stage of the disease.

The term condition or disorder associated with macular edema refers to conditions or disorders in which swelling or thickening of the macula occurs as a result of retinal blood vessels leaking fluid macular edema . Macular edema occurs in and is often a complication of retinal vascular disease. Specific conditions or disorders associated with macular edema include diabetic retinopathy diabetic macular edema proliferative diabetic retinopathy non proliferative diabetic retinopathy age related macular degeneration retinal vein occlusion multifocal choroiditis myopic choroidal neovascularization or retinopathy of prematurity. Treatment of macular edema by the inhibition of Epo can be determined by funduscopic examination optical coherence tomography and improved visual acuity.

The term chimeric antibody is an antibody molecule in which a the constant region or a portion thereof is altered replaced or exchanged so that the antigen binding site variable region is linked to a constant region of a different or altered class effector function and or species or an entirely different molecule which confers new properties to the chimeric antibody e.g. an enzyme toxin hormone growth factor drug etc. or b the variable region or a portion thereof is altered replaced or exchanged with a variable region having a different or altered antigen specificity. For example a mouse antibody can be modified by replacing its constant region with the constant region from a human immunoglobulin. Due to the replacement with a human constant region the chimeric antibody can retain its specificity in recognizing the antigen while having reduced antigenicity in human as compared to the original mouse antibody.

The terms Epo protein or Epo antigen or EPO or Epo are used interchangeably and refer to the erythropoietin protein in different species. For example human Epo has the sequence as set out in Table 1 SEQ ID NO 81. Examples of Epo proteins from other species are provided in Table 1 SEQ ID NOs 82 83 84 or 85. The protein sequences for human cynomolgus mouse rat and rabbit Epo are publicly available and described in Table 1. Human Epo can also be hyperglycosylated. Hyperglycosylated Epo is also know in the art as darbepoietin and can be obtained from various sources including LEK Pharmacueticals.

The term conservatively modified variant applies to both amino acid and nucleic acid sequences. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences conservatively modified variants refers to those nucleic acids which encode identical or essentially identical amino acid sequences or where the nucleic acid does not encode an amino acid sequence to essentially identical sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance the codons GCA GCC GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are silent variations which are one species of conservatively modified variations. Every nucleic acid sequence herein which encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid except AUG which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine and TGG which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule. Accordingly each silent variation of a nucleic acid that encodes a polypeptide is implicit in each described sequence.

For polypeptide sequences conservatively modified variants include individual substitutions deletions or additions to a polypeptide sequence which result in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. Such conservatively modified variants are in addition to and do not exclude polymorphic variants interspecies homologs and alleles of the invention. The following eight groups contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another 1 Alanine A Glycine G 2 Aspartic acid D Glutamic acid E 3 Asparagine N Glutamine Q 4 Arginine R Lysine K 5 Isoleucine I Leucine L Methionine M Valine V 6 Phenylalanine F Tyrosine Y Tryptophan W 7 Serine S Threonine T and 8 Cysteine C Methionine M see e.g. Creighton Proteins 1984 . In some embodiments the term conservative sequence modifications are used to refer to amino acid modifications that do not significantly affect or alter the binding characteristics of the antibody containing the amino acid sequence.

The term epitope means a protein determinant capable of specific binding to an antibody. Epitopes usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural characteristics as well as specific charge characteristics. Conformational and non conformational epitopes are distinguished in that the binding to the former but not the latter is lost in the presence of denaturing solvents.

The term human antibody as used herein is intended to include antibodies having variable regions in which both the framework and CDR regions are derived from sequences of human origin. Furthermore if the antibody contains a constant region the constant region also is derived from such human sequences e.g. human germline sequences or mutated versions of human germline sequences. The human antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human sequences e.g. mutations introduced by random or site specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo .

The term human monoclonal antibody refers to antibodies displaying a single binding specificity which have variable regions in which both the framework and CDR regions are derived from human sequences. In one embodiment the human monoclonal antibodies are produced by hybridomas which include i a B cell obtained from a transgenic non human animal e.g. a transgenic mouse having a genome comprising a human heavy chain transgene and a light chain transgene ii fused to an immortalized cell.

A humanized antibody is an antibody that retains the reactivity of a non human antibody while being less immunogenic in humans. This can be achieved for instance by retaining the non human CDR regions and replacing the remaining parts of the antibody with their human counterparts i.e. the constant region as well as the framework portions of the variable region . See e.g. Morrison et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81 6851 6855 1984 Morrison and Oi Adv. Immunol. 44 65 92 1988 Verhoeyen et al. Science 239 1534 1536 1988 Padlan Molec. Immun. 28 489 498 1991 and Padlan Molec. Immun. 31 169 217 1994. Other examples of human engineering technology include but are not limited to Xoma technology disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 766 886.

The terms identical or 100 percent identity in the context of two or more nucleic acids or polypeptide sequences refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same. Two sequences are substantially identical if two sequences have a specified percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are the same i.e. 60 identity optionally 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 or 99 identity over a specified region or when not specified over the entire sequence when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a comparison window or designated region as measured using one of the following sequence comparison algorithms or by manual alignment and visual inspection. Optionally the identity exists over a region that is at least about 50 nucleotides or 10 amino acids in length or more preferably over a region that is 100 to 500 or 1000 or more nucleotides or 20 50 200 or more amino acids in length.

For sequence comparison typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm test and reference sequences are entered into a computer subsequence coordinates are designated if necessary and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. Default program parameters can be used or alternative parameters can be designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identities for the test sequences relative to the reference sequence based on the program parameters.

A comparison window as used herein includes reference to a segment of any one of the number of contiguous positions selected from the group consisting of from 20 to 600 usually about 50 to about 200 more usually about 100 to about 150 in which a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two sequences are optimally aligned. Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well known in the art. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted e.g. by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman 1970 Adv. Appl. Math. 2 482c by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch J. Mol. Biol. 48 443 1970 by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci. USA 85 2444 1988 by computerized implementations of these algorithms GAP BESTFIT FASTA and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Genetics Computer Group 575 Science Dr. Madison Wis. or by manual alignment and visual inspection see e.g. Brent et al. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons Inc. Ringbou ed. 2003 .

Two examples of algorithms that are suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms which are described in Altschul et al. Nuc. Acids Res. 25 3389 3402 1977 and Altschul et al. J. Mol. Biol. 215 403 410 1990 respectively. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information. This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs HSPs by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence which either match or satisfy some positive valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold Altschul et al. supra . These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using for nucleotide sequences the parameters M reward score for a pair of matching residues always 0 and N penalty score for mismatching residues always 

The BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences see e.g. Karlin and Altschul Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 5873 5787 1993 . One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability P N which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example a nucleic acid is considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than about 0.2 more preferably less than about 0.01 and most preferably less than about 0.001.

The percent identity between two amino acid sequences can also be determined using the algorithm of E. Meyers and W. Miller Comput. Appl. Biosci. 4 11 17 1988 which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program version 2.0 using a PAM120 weight residue table a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. In addition the percent identity between two amino acid sequences can be determined using the Needleman and Wunsch J. Mol Biol. 48 444 453 1970 algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package available on the world wide web at gcg.com using either a Blossom 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix and a gap weight of 16 14 12 10 8 6 or 4 and a length weight of 1 2 3 4 5 or 6.

Other than percentage of sequence identity noted above another indication that two nucleic acid sequences or polypeptides are substantially identical is that the polypeptide encoded by the first nucleic acid is immunologically cross reactive with the antibodies raised against the polypeptide encoded by the second nucleic acid as described below. Thus a polypeptide is typically substantially identical to a second polypeptide for example where the two peptides differ only by conservative substitutions. Another indication that two nucleic acid sequences are substantially identical is that the two molecules or their complements hybridize to each other under stringent conditions as described below. Yet another indication that two nucleic acid sequences are substantially identical is that the same primers can be used to amplify the sequence.

The term inhibit or inhibits Epo dependent cell proliferation refers to the ability of an anti Epo antibody to interfere with cell activation e.g. cell signaling replication and or proliferation stimulated and or induced by Epo. Specifically inhibit refers to a statistically significant decrease i.e. p

As used herein inhibit or inhibits Epo dependent cell signaling refers to the ability of an anti Epo antibody described herein to produce a statistically significant i.e. p

The term isolated antibody refers to an antibody that is substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities e.g. an isolated antibody that specifically binds Epo is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens other than Epo . An isolated antibody that specifically binds Epo may however have cross reactivity to other antigens. Moreover an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and or chemicals.

The term isotype refers to the antibody class e.g. IgM IgE IgG such as IgG1 or IgG4 that is provided by the heavy chain constant region genes. Isotype also includes modified versions of one of these classes where modifications have been made to alter the Fc function for example to enhance or reduce effector functions or binding to Fc receptors. Isotype also refers to the antibody class e.g. kappa lambda that is provided by the light chain constant regions.

The term Kassoc or Ka as used herein is intended to refer to the association rate of a particular antibody antigen interaction whereas the term Kdis or Kd as used herein is intended to refer to the dissociation rate of a particular antibody antigen interaction. The term K as used herein is intended to refer to the dissociation constant which is obtained from the ratio of Kd to Ka i.e. Kd Ka and is expressed as a molar concentration M . Kvalues for antibodies can be determined using methods well established in the art. Methods for determining the Kof an antibody include measuring surface plasmon resonance using a biosensor system such as a Biacore system or measuring affinity in solution by solution equilibrium titration SET .

The terms monoclonal antibody or monoclonal antibody composition as used herein refer to a preparation of antibody molecules of single molecular composition. A monoclonal antibody composition displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular epitope.

The term nucleic acid is used herein interchangeably with the term polynucleotide and refers to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single or double stranded form. The term encompasses nucleic acids containing known nucleotide analogs or modified backbone residues or linkages which are synthetic naturally occurring and non naturally occurring which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid and which are metabolized in a manner similar to the reference nucleotides. Examples of such analogs include without limitation phosphorothioates phosphoramidates methyl phosphonates chiral methyl phosphonates 2 O methyl ribonucleotides peptide nucleic acids PNAs .

Unless otherwise indicated a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof e.g. degenerate codon substitutions and complementary sequences as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically as detailed below degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected or all codons is substituted with mixed base and or deoxyinosine residues Batzer et al. Nucleic Acid Res. 19 5081 1991 Ohtsuka et al. J. Biol. Chem. 260 2605 2608 1985 and Rossolini et al. Mol. Cell. Probes 8 91 98 1994 .

The term operably linked refers to a functional relationship between two or more polynucleotide e.g. DNA segments. Typically the term refers to the functional relationship of a transcriptional regulatory sequence to a transcribed sequence. For example a promoter or enhancer sequence is operably linked to a coding sequence if it stimulates or modulates the transcription of the coding sequence in an appropriate host cell or other expression system. Generally promoter transcriptional regulatory sequences that are operably linked to a transcribed sequence are physically contiguous to the transcribed sequence i.e. they are cis acting. However some transcriptional regulatory sequences such as enhancers need not be physically contiguous or located in close proximity to the coding sequences whose transcription they enhance.

As used herein the term optimized means that a nucleotide sequence has been altered to encode an amino acid sequence using codons that are preferred in the production cell or organism generally a eukaryotic cell for example a cell of Pichia a Chinese Hamster Ovary cell CHO or a human cell. The optimized nucleotide sequence is engineered to retain completely or as much as possible the amino acid sequence originally encoded by the starting nucleotide sequence which is also known as the parental sequence. The optimized sequences herein have been engineered to have codons that are preferred in mammalian cells. However optimized expression of these sequences in other eukaryotic cells or prokaryotic cells is also envisioned herein. The amino acid sequences encoded by optimized nucleotide sequences are also referred to as optimized.

The terms polypeptide and protein are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residue is an artificial chemical mimetic of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers and non naturally occurring amino acid polymer. Unless otherwise indicated a particular polypeptide sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof.

The term recombinant human antibody as used herein includes all human antibodies that are prepared expressed created or isolated by recombinant means such as antibodies isolated from an animal e.g. a mouse that is transgenic or transchromosomal for human immunoglobulin genes or a hybridoma prepared therefrom antibodies isolated from a host cell transformed to express the human antibody e.g. from a transfectoma antibodies isolated from a recombinant combinatorial human antibody library and antibodies prepared expressed created or isolated by any other means that involve splicing of all or a portion of a human immunoglobulin gene sequences to other DNA sequences. Such recombinant human antibodies have variable regions in which the framework and CDR regions are derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. In certain embodiments however such recombinant human antibodies can be subjected to in vitro mutagenesis or when an animal transgenic for human Ig sequences is used in vivo somatic mutagenesis and thus the amino acid sequences of the VH and VL regions of the recombinant antibodies are sequences that while derived from and related to human germline VH and VL sequences may not naturally exist within the human antibody germline repertoire in vivo.

The term recombinant host cell or simply host cell refers to a cell into which a recombinant expression vector has been introduced. It should be understood that such terms are intended to refer not only to the particular subject cell but to the progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or environmental influences such progeny may not in fact be identical to the parent cell but are still included within the scope of the term host cell as used herein.

The term subject includes human and non human animals. Non human animals include all vertebrates e.g. mammals and non mammals such as non human primates e.g. cynomolgus monkey sheep dog cow chickens amphibians and reptiles. Except when noted the terms patient or subject are used herein interchangeably. As used herein the terms cyno or cynomolgus refer to the cynomolgus monkey .

As used herein the term treating or treatment of any disease or disorder e.g. retinal vascular disease diabetic retinopathy macular edema refers in one embodiment to ameliorating the disease or disorder i.e. slowing or arresting or reducing the development of the disease or at least one of the clinical symptoms thereof . In another embodiment treating or treatment refers to alleviating or ameliorating at least one physical parameter including those which may not be discernible by the patient. In yet another embodiment treating or treatment refers to modulating the disease or disorder either physically e.g. stabilization of a discernible symptom physiologically e.g. stabilization of a physical parameter or both. In yet another embodiment treating or treatment refers to preventing or delaying the onset or development or progression of the disease or disorder. Prevention as it relates to indications described herein including conditions or disorders associated with retinal vascular disease conditions or disorders associated with diabetic retinopathy and or conditions or disorders associated with macular edema means any action that prevents or slows a worsening in visual function retinal anatomy retinal vascular disease parameter diabetic retinopathy disease parameter and or macular edema disease parameter as described below in a patient at risk for said worsening. More specifically treatment of conditions or disorders associated with retinal vascular disease conditions or disorders associated with diabetic retinopathy and or conditions or disorders associated with macular edema means any action that results in or is contemplated to result in the improvement or preservation of visual function and or retinal anatomy. Methods for assessing treatment and or prevention of disease are known in the art and described herein below.

The term vector is intended to refer to a polynucleotide molecule capable of transporting another polynucleotide to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a plasmid which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a viral vector such as an adeno associated viral vector AAV or AAV2 wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced e.g. bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors . Other vectors e.g. non episomal mammalian vectors can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as recombinant expression vectors or simply expression vectors . In general expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification plasmid and vector may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector. However the invention is intended to include such other forms of expression vectors such as viral vectors e.g. replication defective retroviruses adenoviruses and adeno associated viruses which serve equivalent functions.

The present invention is based in part on the discovery of antibody molecules that specifically bind to Epo. The invention relates to both full IgG format antibodies as well as antigen binding fragments thereof such as Fab fragments e.g. see antibodies NVS1 NVS2 NVS3 and NVS4 .

Accordingly the present invention provides antibodies that specifically bind to Epo e.g. human Epo cynomolgus Epo rat Epo and mouse Epo pharmaceutical compositions production methods and methods of use of such antibodies and compositions.

The present invention provides antibodies that specifically bind to Epo. In some embodiments the present invention provides antibodies that specifically bind to human cynomolgus rat and or mouse Epo as well as human hyperglycosylated Epo darbepoietin . Antibodies of the invention include but are not limited to the human monoclonal antibodies and Fabs isolated as described in the Examples.

The present invention provides antibodies that specifically bind an Epo protein e.g. human cynomolgus rat and or mouse Epo wherein the antibodies comprise a VH domain having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 13 33 53 or 73.

In particular the invention provides antibodies that specifically bind to an Epo protein e.g. human cynomolgus rat and or mouse Epo said antibodies comprising or alternatively consisting of one two three or more VL CDRs having an amino acid sequence of any of the VL CDRs listed in Table 1 infra.

Other antibodies of the invention include amino acids that have been mutated yet have at least 80 85 90 95 96 97 98 or 99 percent identity in the CDR regions with the CDR regions depicted in the sequences described in Table 1. In some embodiments it includes mutant amino acid sequences wherein no more than 1 2 3 4 or 5 amino acids have been mutated in the CDR regions when compared with the CDR regions depicted in the sequence described in Table 1.

The present invention also provides nucleic acid sequences that encode VH VL the full length heavy chain and the full length light chain of the antibodies that specifically bind to an Epo protein e.g. human cynomolgus rat and or mouse Epo . Such nucleic acid sequences can be optimized for expression in mammalian cells for example Table 1 shows the optimized nucleic acid sequences for the heavy chain and light chain of antibodies of the invention .

Other antibodies of the invention include those where the amino acids or nucleic acids encoding the amino acids have been mutated yet have at least 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 or 95 percent identity to the sequences described in Table 1. Some embodiments include mutant amino acid sequences wherein no more than 1 2 3 4 or 5 amino acids have been mutated in the variable regions when compared with the variable regions depicted in the sequence described in Table 1 while retaining substantially the same antigen binding activity.

Since each of these antibodies can bind to Epo the VH VL full length light chain and full length heavy chain sequences amino acid sequences and the nucleotide sequences encoding the amino acid sequences can be mixed and matched to create other Epo binding antibodies of the invention. Such mixed and matched Epo binding antibodies can be tested using the binding assays known in the art e.g. ELISAs and other assays described in the Example section . When these chains are mixed and matched a VH sequence from a particular VH VL pairing should be replaced with a structurally similar VH sequence. Likewise a full length heavy chain sequence from a particular full length heavy chain full length light chain pairing should be replaced with a structurally similar full length heavy chain sequence. Likewise a VL sequence from a particular VH VL pairing should be replaced with a structurally similar VL sequence. Likewise a full length light chain sequence from a particular full length heavy chain full length light chain pairing should be replaced with a structurally similar full length light chain sequence. Accordingly in one aspect the invention provides an isolated antibody or antigen binding region thereof having a heavy chain variable domain comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 13 33 53 and 73 and a light chain variable domain comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 14 34 54 and 74 wherein the antibody specifically binds to Epo e.g. human cynomolgus rat and or mouse Epo . More specifically in certain aspects the invention provides an isolated antibody or antigen binding region thereof having a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain comprising amino acid sequences selected from SEQ ID NOs 13 and 14 respectively.

The terms complementarity determining region and CDR as used herein refer to the sequences of amino acids within antibody variable regions which confer antigen specificity and binding affinity. In general there are three CDRs in each heavy chain variable region HCDR1 HCDR2 HCDR3 and three CDRs in each light chain variable region LCDR1 LCDR2 LCDR3 .

The precise amino acid sequence boundaries of a given CDR can be readily determined using any of a number of well known schemes including those described by Kabat et al. 1991 Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. Kabat numbering scheme Al Lazikani et al. 1997 JMB 273 927 948 Chothia numbering scheme .

For example under Kabat the CDR amino acid residues in the heavy chain variable domain VH are numbered 31 35 HCDR1 50 65 HCDR2 and 95 102 HCDR3 and the CDR amino acid residues in the light chain variable domain VL are numbered 24 34 LCDR1 50 56 LCDR2 and 89 97 LCDR3 . Under Chothia the CDR amino acids in the VH are numbered 26 32 HCDR1 52 56 HCDR2 and 95 102 HCDR3 and the amino acid residues in VL are numbered 26 32 LCDR1 50 52 LCDR2 and 91 96 LCDR3 . By combining the CDR definitions of both Kabat and Chothia the CDRs consist of amino acid residues 26 35 HCDR1 50 65 HCDR2 and 95 102 HCDR3 in human VH and amino acid residues 24 34 LCDR1 50 56 LCDR2 and 89 97 LCDR3 in human VL.

In another aspect the present invention provides Epo binding antibodies that comprise the heavy chain and light chain CDR1s CDR2s and CDR3s as described in Table 1 or combinations thereof. The amino acid sequences of the VH CDR1s of the antibodies are shown in SEQ ID NOs 1 21 41 or 61. The amino acid sequences of the VH CDR2s of the antibodies and are shown in SEQ ID NOs 2 22 42 or 62. The amino acid sequences of the VH CDR3s of the antibodies are shown in SEQ ID NOs 3 23 43 or 63. The amino acid sequences of the VL CDR1s of the antibodies are shown in SEQ ID NOs 4 24 44 or 64. The amino acid sequences of the VL CDR2s of the antibodies are shown in SEQ ID NOs 5 25 45 or 65. The amino acid sequences of the VL CDR3s of the antibodies are shown in SEQ ID NOs 6 26 46 or 66. These CDR regions are delineated using the Kabat system.

Alternatively as defined using the Chothia system Al Lazikani et al. 1997 JMB 273 927 948 the amino acid sequences of the VH CDR1s of the antibodies are shown in SEQ ID NOs 7 27 47 or 67. The amino acid sequences of the VH CDR2s of the antibodies and are shown in SEQ ID NOs 8 28 48 or 68. The amino acid sequences of the VH CDR3s of the antibodies are shown in SEQ ID NOs 9 29 49 or 69.

The amino acid sequences of the VL CDR3s of the antibodies are shown in SEQ ID NOs 12 32 52 or 72.

Given that each of these antibodies can bind to Epo and that antigen binding specificity is provided primarily by the CDR1 2 and 3 regions the VH CDR1 2 and 3 sequences and VL CDR1 2 and 3 sequences can be mixed and matched i.e. CDRs from different antibodies can be mixed and matched although each antibody preferably contains a VH CDR1 2 and 3 and a VL CDR1 2 and 3 to create other Epo binding molecules of the invention. Such mixed and matched Epo binding antibodies can be tested using the binding assays known in the art and those described in the Examples e.g. ELISAs SET Biacore . When VH CDR sequences are mixed and matched the CDR1 CDR2 and or CDR3 sequence from a particular VH sequence should be replaced with a structurally similar CDR sequence s . Likewise when VL CDR sequences are mixed and matched the CDR1 CDR2 and or CDR3 sequence from a particular VL sequence should be replaced with a structurally similar CDR sequence s . It will be readily apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan that novel VH and VL sequences can be created by substituting one or more VH and or VL CDR region sequences with structurally similar sequences from the CDR sequences shown herein for monoclonal antibodies of the present invention. In addition to the foregoing in one embodiment the antigen binding fragments of the antibodies described herein can comprise a VH CDR1 2 and 3 or a VL CDR 1 2 and 3 wherein the fragment binds to Epo as a single variable domain.

As used herein a human antibody comprises heavy or light chain variable regions or full length heavy or light chains that are the product of or derived from a particular germline sequence if the variable regions or full length chains of the antibody are obtained from a system that uses human germline immunoglobulin genes. Such systems include immunizing a transgenic mouse carrying human immunoglobulin genes with the antigen of interest or screening a human immunoglobulin gene library displayed on phage with the antigen of interest. A human antibody that is the product of or derived from a human germline immunoglobulin sequence can be identified as such by comparing the amino acid sequence of the human antibody to the amino acid sequences of human germline immunoglobulins and selecting the human germline immunoglobulin sequence that is closest in sequence i.e. greatest identity to the sequence of the human antibody. A human antibody that is the product of or derived from a particular human germline immunoglobulin sequence may contain amino acid differences as compared to the germline sequence due to for example naturally occurring somatic mutations or intentional introduction of site directed mutations. However in the VH or VL framework regions a selected human antibody typically is at least 90 identical in amino acids sequence to an amino acid sequence encoded by a human germline immunoglobulin gene and contains amino acid residues that identify the human antibody as being human when compared to the germline immunoglobulin amino acid sequences of other species e.g. murine germline sequences . In certain cases a human antibody may be at least 60 70 80 90 or at least 95 or even at least 96 97 98 or 99 identical in amino acid sequence to the amino acid sequence encoded by the germline immunoglobulin gene. Typically a recombinant human antibody will display no more than 10 amino acid differences from the amino acid sequence encoded by the human germline immunoglobulin gene in the VH or VL framework regions. In certain cases the human antibody may display no more than 5 or even no more than 4 3 2 or 1 amino acid difference from the amino acid sequence encoded by the germline immunoglobulin gene. Examples of human germline immunoglobulin genes include but are not limited to the variable domain germline fragments described below as well as DP47 and DPK9.

In certain other aspects of the invention the heavy and light chain sequences further comprise HCDR1 HCDR2 HCDR3 LCDR1 LCDR2 and LCDR3 sequences as defined by Chothia for example SEQ ID NOs 7 8 9 10 11 and 12 respectively SEQ ID NOs 27 28 29 30 31 and 32 respectively SEQ ID NOs 47 48 49 50 51 and 52 respectively or SEQ ID NOs 67 68 69 70 71 and 72 respectively.

In other embodiments the VH and or VL amino acid sequences may be identical except for an amino acid substitution in no more than 1 2 3 4 or 5 amino acid positions.

As used herein the percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences i.e. identity equals number of identical positions total number of positions 100 taking into account the number of gaps and the length of each gap which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm as described in the non limiting examples below.

Additionally or alternatively the protein sequences of the present invention can further be used as a query sequence to perform a search against public databases to for example identify related sequences.

The present invention provides antibodies that bind to the same epitope as the Epo binding antibodies described in Table 1. Additional antibodies can therefore be identified based on their ability to compete e.g. to competitively inhibit the binding of in a statistically significant manner with other antibodies of the invention in Epo binding assays such as those described in the Examples . The ability of a test antibody to inhibit the binding of antibodies of the present invention to an Epo protein demonstrates that the test antibody can compete with that antibody for binding to Epo such an antibody may according to non limiting theory bind to the same or a related e.g. a structurally similar or spatially proximal epitope on the Epo protein as the antibody with which it competes.

An antibody of the invention further can be prepared using an antibody having one or more of the VH and or VL sequences shown herein as starting material to engineer a modified antibody which modified antibody may have altered properties from the starting antibody. An antibody can be engineered by modifying one or more residues within one or both variable regions i.e. VH and or VL for example within one or more CDR regions and or within one or more framework regions. Additionally or alternatively an antibody can be engineered by modifying residues within the constant region s for example to alter the effector function s of the antibody.

One type of variable region engineering that can be performed is CDR grafting. Antibodies interact with target antigens predominantly through amino acid residues that are located in the six heavy and light chain complementarity determining regions CDRs . For this reason the amino acid sequences within CDRs are more diverse between individual antibodies than sequences outside of CDRs. Because CDR sequences are responsible for most antibody antigen interactions it is possible to express recombinant antibodies that mimic the properties of specific naturally occurring antibodies by constructing expression vectors that include CDR sequences from the specific naturally occurring antibody grafted onto framework sequences from a different antibody with different properties see e.g. Riechmann L. et al. 1998 Nature 332 323 327 Jones P. et al. 1986 Nature 321 522 525 Queen C. et al. 1989 Proc. Natl. Acad. U.S.A. 86 10029 10033 U.S. Pat. No. 5 225 539 to Winter and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 530 101 5 585 089 5 693 762 and 6 180 370 to Queen et al. 

Accordingly another embodiment of the invention pertains to an isolated antibody or an antigen binding fragment thereof comprising a heavy chain variable region comprising CDR1 sequences having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 1 21 41 and 61 CDR2 sequences having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 2 22 42 and 62 CDR3 sequences having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 3 23 43 and 63 respectively and a light chain variable region having CDR1 sequences having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 4 24 44 and 64 CDR2 sequences having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 5 25 45 and 65 and CDR3 sequences consisting of an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 6 26 46 and 66 respectively. Thus such antibodies contain the VH and VL CDR sequences of monoclonal antibodies yet may contain different framework sequences from these antibodies.

Alternatively another embodiment of the invention pertains to an isolated antibody or an antigen binding fragment thereof comprising a heavy chain variable region comprising CDR1 sequences having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 7 27 47 and 67 CDR2 sequences having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 8 28 48 and 68 CDR3 sequences having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 9 29 49 and 69 respectively and a light chain variable region having CDR1 sequences having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 10 30 50 and 70 CDR2 sequences having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 11 31 51 and 71 and CDR3 sequences consisting of an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 12 32 52 and 72 respectively. Thus such antibodies contain the VH and VL CDR sequences of monoclonal antibodies yet may contain different framework sequences from these antibodies.

Such framework sequences can be obtained from public DNA databases or published references that include germline antibody gene sequences. For example germline DNA sequences for human heavy and light chain variable region genes can be found in the VBase human germline sequence database available on the world wide web at mrc cpe.cam.ac.uk vbase as well as in Kabat E. A. et al. 1991 Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest Fifth Edition U.S. Department of Health and Human Services NIH Publication No. 91 3242 Tomlinson I. M. et al. 1992 J. Mol. Biol. 227 776 798 and Cox J. P. L. et al. 1994 Eur. J Immunol. 24 827 836 the contents of each of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.

An example of framework sequences for use in the antibodies of the invention are those that are structurally similar to the framework sequences used by selected antibodies of the invention e.g. consensus sequences and or framework sequences used by monoclonal antibodies of the invention. The VH CDR1 2 and 3 sequences and the VL CDR1 2 and 3 sequences can be grafted onto framework regions that have the identical sequence as that found in the germline immunoglobulin gene from which the framework sequence derive or the CDR sequences can be grafted onto framework regions that contain one or more mutations as compared to the germline sequences. For example it has been found that in certain instances it is beneficial to mutate residues within the framework regions to maintain or enhance the antigen binding ability of the antibody see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 530 101 5 585 089 5 693 762 and 6 180 370 to Queen et al . Frameworks that can be utilized as scaffolds on which to build the antibodies and antigen binding fragments described herein include but are not limited to VH1A VH1B VH3 Vk1 Vl2 and Vk2.

Accordingly an embodiment of the invention relates to isolated Epo binding antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof comprising a heavy chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 13 33 53 and 73 or an amino acid sequence having one two three four or five amino acid substitutions deletions or additions in the framework region of such sequences and further comprising a light chain variable region having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 14 34 54 and 74 or an amino acid sequence having one two three four or five amino acid substitutions deletions or additions in the framework region of such sequences.

Another type of variable region modification is to mutate amino acid residues within the VH and or VL CDR1 CDR2 and or CDR3 regions to thereby improve one or more binding properties e.g. affinity of the antibody of interest known as affinity maturation. Site directed mutagenesis or PCR mediated mutagenesis can be performed to introduce the mutation s and the effect on antibody binding or other functional property of interest can be evaluated in in vitro or in vivo assays as described herein and provided in the Examples. Conservative modifications as discussed above can be introduced. The mutations may be amino acid substitutions additions or deletions. Moreover typically no more than one two three four or five residues within a CDR region are altered.

Accordingly in another embodiment the invention provides isolated Epo binding antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof consisting of a heavy chain variable region having a VH CDR1 region consisting of an amino acid sequence selected from the group having SEQ ID NOs 7 27 47 and 67 or an amino acid sequence having one two three four or five amino acid substitutions deletions or additions as compared to SEQ ID NOs 7 27 47 or 67 a VH CDR2 region having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 8 28 48 and 68 or an amino acid sequence having one two three four or five amino acid substitutions deletions or additions as compared to SEQ ID NOs 8 28 48 or 68 a VH CDR3 region having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 9 29 49 and 69 or an amino acid sequence having one two three four or five amino acid substitutions deletions or additions as compared to SEQ ID NOs 9 29 49 or 69 a VL CDR1 region having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 10 30 50 and 70 or an amino acid sequence having one two three four or five amino acid substitutions deletions or additions as compared to SEQ ID NOs 10 30 50 or 70 a VL CDR2 region having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 11 31 51 and 71 or an amino acid sequence having one two three four or five amino acid substitutions deletions or additions as compared to SEQ ID NOs 11 31 51 or 71 and a VL CDR3 region having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 12 32 52 and 72 or an amino acid sequence having one two three four or five amino acid substitutions deletions or additions as compared to SEQ ID NOs 12 32 52 or 72.

A wide variety of antibody immunoglobulin frameworks or scaffolds can be employed so long as the resulting polypeptide includes at least one binding region which specifically binds to Epo. Such frameworks or scaffolds include the 5 main idiotypes of human immunoglobulins or fragments thereof and include immunoglobulins of other animal species preferably having humanized aspects. Single heavy chain antibodies such as those identified in camelids are of particular interest in this regard. Novel frameworks scaffolds and fragments continue to be discovered and developed by those skilled in the art.

In one aspect the invention pertains to generating non immunoglobulin based antibodies using non immunoglobulin scaffolds onto which CDRs of the invention can be grafted. Known or future non immunoglobulin frameworks and scaffolds may be employed as long as they comprise a binding region specific for the target Epo protein. Known non immunoglobulin frameworks or scaffolds include but are not limited to fibronectin Compound Therapeutics Inc. Waltham Mass. ankyrin Molecular Partners AG Zurich Switzerland domain antibodies Domantis Ltd. Cambridge Mass. and Ablynx nv Zwijnaarde Belgium lipocalin Pieris Proteolab AG Freising Germany small modular immuno pharmaceuticals Trubion Pharmaceuticals Inc. Seattle Wash. maxybodies Avidia Inc. Mountain View Calif. Protein A Affibody AG Sweden and affilin gamma crystallin or ubiquitin Scil Proteins GmbH Halle Germany .

The fibronectin scaffolds are based on fibronectin type III domain e.g. the tenth module of the fibronectin type III 10 Fn3 domain . The fibronectin type III domain has 7 or 8 beta strands which are distributed between two beta sheets which themselves pack against each other to form the core of the protein and further containing loops analogous to CDRs which connect the beta strands to each other and are solvent exposed. There are at least three such loops at each edge of the beta sheet sandwich where the edge is the boundary of the protein perpendicular to the direction of the beta strands see U.S. Pat. No. 6 818 418 . These fibronectin based scaffolds are not an immunoglobulin although the overall fold is closely related to that of the smallest functional antibody fragment the variable region of the heavy chain which comprises the entire antigen recognition unit in camel and llama IgG. Because of this structure the non immunoglobulin antibody mimics antigen binding properties that are similar in nature and affinity to those of antibodies. These scaffolds can be used in a loop randomization and shuffling strategy in vitro that is similar to the process of affinity maturation of antibodies in vivo. These fibronectin based molecules can be used as scaffolds where the loop regions of the molecule can be replaced with CDRs of the invention using standard cloning techniques.

The ankyrin technology is based on using proteins with ankyrin derived repeat modules as scaffolds for bearing variable regions which can be used for binding to different targets. The ankyrin repeat module is a 33 amino acid polypeptide consisting of two anti parallel helices and a turn. Binding of the variable regions is mostly optimized by using ribosome display.

Avimers are derived from natural A domain containing protein such as LRP 1. These domains are used by nature for protein protein interactions and in human over 250 proteins are structurally based on A domains. Avimers consist of a number of different A domain monomers 2 10 linked via amino acid linkers. Avimers can be created that can bind to the target antigen using the methodology described in for example U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 20040175756 20050053973 20050048512 and 20060008844.

Affibody affinity ligands are small simple proteins composed of a three helix bundle based on the scaffold of one of the IgG binding domains of Protein A. Protein A is a surface protein from the bacterium . This scaffold domain consists of 58 amino acids 13 of which are randomized to generate affibody libraries with a large number of ligand variants See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 831 012 . Affibody molecules mimic antibodies they have a molecular weight of 6 kDa compared to the molecular weight of antibodies which is 150 kDa. In spite of its small size the binding site of affibody molecules is similar to that of an antibody.

Anticalins are products developed by the company Pieris ProteoLab AG. They are derived from lipocalins a widespread group of small and robust proteins that are usually involved in the physiological transport or storage of chemically sensitive or insoluble compounds. Several natural lipocalins occur in human tissues or body liquids. The protein architecture is reminiscent of immunoglobulins with hypervariable loops on top of a rigid framework. However in contrast with antibodies or their recombinant fragments lipocalins are composed of a single polypeptide chain with 160 to 180 amino acid residues being just marginally bigger than a single immunoglobulin domain. The set of four loops which makes up the binding pocket shows pronounced structural plasticity and tolerates a variety of side chains. The binding site can thus be reshaped in a proprietary process in order to recognize prescribed target molecules of different shape with high affinity and specificity. One protein of lipocalin family the bilin binding protein BBP of Pieris brassicae has been used to develop anticalins by mutagenizing the set of four loops. One example of a patent application describing anticalins is in PCT Publication No. WO 1999 16873.

Affilin molecules are small non immunoglobulin proteins which are designed for specific affinities towards proteins and small molecules. New affilin molecules can be very quickly selected from two libraries each of which is based on a different human derived scaffold protein. Affilin molecules do not show any structural homology to immunoglobulin proteins. Currently two affilin scaffolds are employed one of which is gamma crystalline a human structural eye lens protein and the other is ubiquitin superfamily proteins. Both human scaffolds are very small show high temperature stability and are almost resistant to pH changes and denaturing agents. This high stability is mainly due to the expanded beta sheet structure of the proteins. Examples of gamma crystalline derived proteins are described in WO 2001 04144 and examples of ubiquitin like proteins are described in WO 2004 106368.

Protein epitope mimetics PEM are medium sized cyclic peptide like molecules MW 1 2 kDa mimicking beta hairpin secondary structures of proteins the major secondary structure involved in protein protein interactions.

The present invention provides fully human antibodies that specifically bind to an Epo protein. Compared to the chimeric or humanized antibodies the human Epo binding antibodies of the invention have further reduced antigenicity when administered to human subjects.

Antibody proteins obtained from members of the camel and dromedary and family including new world members such as llama species and have been characterized with respect to size structural complexity and antigenicity for human subjects. Certain IgG antibodies from this family of mammals as found in nature lack light chains and are thus structurally distinct from the typical four chain quaternary structure having two heavy and two light chains for antibodies from other animals. See PCT EP93 02214 WO 94 04678 published 3 Mar. 1994 .

A region of the camelid antibody which is the small single variable domain identified as VHH can be obtained by genetic engineering to yield a small protein having high affinity for a target resulting in a low molecular weight antibody derived protein known as a camelid nanobody . See U.S. Pat. No. 5 759 808 issued Jun. 2 1998 see also Stijlemans B. et al. 2004 J Biol Chem 279 1256 1261 Dumoulin M. et al. 2003 Nature 424 783 788 Pleschberger M. et al. 2003 Bioconjugate Chem 14 440 448 Cortez Retamozo V. et al. 2002 Int J Cancer 89 456 62 and Lauwereys M. et al. 1998 EMBO J 17 3512 3520. Engineered libraries of camelid antibodies and antibody fragments are commercially available for example from Ablynx Ghent Belgium. As with other antibodies of non human origin an amino acid sequence of a camelid antibody can be altered recombinantly to obtain a sequence that more closely resembles a human sequence i.e. the nanobody can be humanized . Thus the natural low antigenicity of camelid antibodies to humans can be further reduced.

The camelid nanobody has a molecular weight approximately one tenth that of a human IgG molecule and the protein has a physical diameter of only a few nanometers. One consequence of the small size is the ability of camelid nanobodies to bind to antigenic sites that are functionally invisible to larger antibody proteins i.e. camelid nanobodies are useful as reagents detect antigens that are otherwise cryptic using classical immunological techniques and as possible therapeutic agents. Thus yet another consequence of small size is that a camelid nanobody can inhibit as a result of binding to a specific site in a groove or narrow cleft of a target protein and hence can serve in a capacity that more closely resembles the function of a classical low molecular weight drug than that of a classical antibody.

The low molecular weight and compact size further result in camelid nanobodies being extremely thermostable stable to extreme pH and to proteolytic digestion and poorly antigenic. Another consequence is that camelid nanobodies readily move from the circulatory system into tissues and even cross the blood brain barrier and can treat disorders that affect nervous tissue. Nanobodies can further facilitated drug transport across the blood brain barrier. See U.S. patent application 20040161738 published Aug. 19 2004. These features combined with the low antigenicity to humans indicate great therapeutic potential. Further these molecules can be fully expressed in prokaryotic cells such as and are expressed as fusion proteins with bacteriophage and are functional.

Accordingly a feature of the present invention is a camelid antibody or nanobody having high affinity for Epo. In certain embodiments herein the camelid antibody or nanobody is naturally produced in the camelid animal i.e. is produced by the camelid following immunization with Epo or a peptide fragment thereof using techniques described herein for other antibodies. Alternatively the Epo binding camelid nanobody is engineered i.e. produced by selection for example from a library of phage displaying appropriately mutagenized camelid nanobody proteins using panning procedures with Epo as a target as described in the examples herein. Engineered nanobodies can further be customized by genetic engineering to have a half life in a recipient subject of from 45 minutes to two weeks. In a specific embodiment the camelid antibody or nanobody is obtained by grafting the CDRs sequences of the heavy or light chain of the human antibodies of the invention into nanobody or single domain antibody framework sequences as described for example in WO 1994 004678.

In another aspect the present invention features bispecific or multispecific molecules comprising an Epo binding antibody or a fragment thereof of the invention. An antibody of the invention or antigen binding regions thereof can be derivatized or linked to another functional molecule e.g. another peptide or protein e.g. another antibody or ligand for a receptor to generate a bispecific molecule that binds to at least two different binding sites or target molecules. The antibody of the invention may in fact be derivatized or linked to more than one other functional molecule to generate multi specific molecules that bind to more than two different binding sites and or target molecules such multi specific molecules are also intended to be encompassed by the term bispecific molecule as used herein. To create a bispecific molecule of the invention an antibody of the invention can be functionally linked e.g. by chemical coupling genetic fusion noncovalent association or otherwise to one or more other binding molecules such as another antibody antibody fragment peptide or binding mimetic such that a bispecific molecule results.

Accordingly the present invention includes bispecific molecules comprising at least one first binding specificity for Epo and a second binding specificity for a second target epitope. For example the second target epitope is another epitope of Epo different from the first target epitope.

Additionally for the invention in which the bispecific molecule is multi specific the molecule can further include a third binding specificity in addition to the first and second target epitope.

In one embodiment the bispecific molecules of the invention comprise as a binding specificity at least one antibody or an antibody fragment thereof including e.g. a Fab Fab F ab 2 Fv or a single chain Fv. The antibody may also be a light chain or heavy chain dimer or any minimal fragment thereof such as a Fv or a single chain construct as described in Ladner et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 778.

Diabodies are bivalent bispecific molecules in which VH and VL domains are expressed on a single polypeptide chain connected by a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between the two domains on the same chain. The VH and VL domains pair with complementary domains of another chain thereby creating two antigen binding sites see e.g. Holliger et al. 1993 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 6444 6448 Poljak et al. 1994 Structure 2 1121 1123 . Diabodies can be produced by expressing two polypeptide chains with either the structure VHA VLB and VHB VLA VH VL configuration or VLA VHB and VLB VHA VL VH configuration within the same cell. Most of them can be expressed in soluble form in bacteria. Single chain diabodies scDb are produced by connecting the two diabody forming polypeptide chains with linker of approximately 15 amino acid residues see Holliger and Winter 1997 Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 45 3 4 128 30 Wu et al. 1996 Immunotechnology 2 1 21 36 . scDb can be expressed in bacteria in soluble active monomeric form see Holliger and Winter 1997 Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 45 34 128 30 Wu et al. 1996 Immunotechnology 2 1 21 36 Pluckthun and Pack 1997 Immunotechnology 3 2 83 105 Ridgway et al. 1996 Protein Eng. 9 7 617 21 . A diabody can be fused to Fc to generate a di diabody see Lu et al. 2004 J. Biol. Chem. 279 4 2856 65 .

Other antibodies which can be employed in the bispecific molecules of the invention are murine chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies.

Bispecific molecules can be prepared by conjugating the constituent binding specificities using methods known in the art. For example each binding specificity of the bispecific molecule can be generated separately and then conjugated to one another. When the binding specificities are proteins or peptides a variety of coupling or cross linking agents can be used for covalent conjugation. Examples of cross linking agents include protein A carbodiimide N succinimidyl S acetyl thioacetate SATA 5 5 dithiobis 2 nitrobenzoic acid DTNB o phenylenedimaleimide oPDM N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP and sulfosuccinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohaxane 1 carboxylate sulfo SMCC see e.g. Karpovsky et al. 1984 J. Exp. Med. 160 1686 Liu M A et al. 1985 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82 8648 . Other methods include those described in Paulus 1985 Behring Ins. Mitt. No. 78 118 132 Brennan et al. 1985 Science 229 81 83 and Glennie et al. 1987 J. Immunol. 139 2367 2375 . Conjugating agents are SATA and sulfo SMCC both available from Pierce Chemical Co. Rockford Ill. .

When the binding specificities are antibodies they can be conjugated by sulfhydryl bonding of the C terminus hinge regions of the two heavy chains. In a particularly embodiment the hinge region is modified to contain an odd number of sulfhydryl residues for example one prior to conjugation.

Alternatively both binding specificities can be encoded in the same vector and expressed and assembled in the same host cell. This method is particularly useful where the bispecific molecule is a mAb mAb mAb Fab Fab F ab 2 or ligand Fab fusion protein. A bispecific molecule of the invention can be a single chain molecule comprising one single chain antibody and a binding determinant or a single chain bispecific molecule comprising two binding determinants. Bispecific molecules may comprise at least two single chain molecules. Methods for preparing bispecific molecules are described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 260 203 5 455 030 4 881 175 5 132 405 5 091 513 5 476 786 5 013 653 5 258 498 and 5 482 858.

Binding of the bispecific molecules to their specific targets can be confirmed by for example enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA radioimmunoassay REA FACS analysis bioassay e.g. growth inhibition or Western Blot assay. Each of these assays generally detects the presence of protein antibody complexes of particular interest by employing a labeled reagent e.g. an antibody specific for the complex of interest.

In another aspect the present invention provides multivalent compounds comprising at least two identical or different antigen binding portions of the antibodies of the invention binding to Epo. The antigen binding portions can be linked together via protein fusion or covalent or noncovalent linkage. Alternatively methods of linkage have been described for the bispecific molecules. Tetravalent compounds can be obtained for example by cross linking antibodies of the antibodies of the invention with an antibody that binds to the constant regions of the antibodies of the invention for example the Fc or hinge region.

Trimerizing domain are described for example in Borean patent EP 1 012 280B1. Pentamerizing modules are described for example in WO 1998 018943.

The present invention provides for antibodies that specifically bind to Epo protein which have an extended half life in vivo.

Many factors may affect a protein s half life in vivo for example kidney filtration metabolism in the liver degradation by proteolytic enzymes proteases and immunogenic responses e.g. protein neutralization by antibodies and uptake by macrophages and dendritic cells . A variety of strategies can be used to extend the half life of the antibodies of the present invention. For example by chemical linkage to polyethyleneglycol PEG reCODE PEG antibody scaffold polysialic acid PSA hydroxyethyl starch HES albumin binding ligands and carbohydrate shields by genetic fusion to proteins binding to serum proteins such as albumin IgG FcRn and transferring by coupling genetically or chemically to other binding moieties that bind to serum proteins such as nanobodies Fabs DARPins avimers affibodies and anticalins by genetic fusion to rPEG albumin domain of albumin albumin binding proteins and Fc or by incorporation into nanocarriers slow release formulations or medical devices.

To prolong the serum circulation of antibodies in vivo inert polymer molecules such as high molecular weight polyethylene glycol PEG can be attached to the antibodies or a fragment thereof with or without a multifunctional linker either through site specific conjugation of the PEG to the N or C terminus of the antibodies or via epsilon amino groups present on lysine residues. To pegylate an antibody the antibody or fragment thereof typically is reacted with PEG such as a reactive ester or aldehyde derivative of PEG under conditions in which one or more PEG groups become attached to the antibody or antibody fragment. The pegylation can be carried out by an acylation reaction or an alkylation reaction with a reactive PEG molecule or an analogous reactive water soluble polymer . As used herein the terms polyethylene glycol and PEG are intended to encompass any of the forms of PEG that have been used to derivatize other proteins such as mono C1 C10 alkoxy or aryloxy polyethylene glycol or polyethylene glycol maleimide. In certain embodiments the antibody to be pegylated is an aglycosylated antibody. Linear or branched polymer derivatization that results in minimal loss of biological activity will be used. The degree of conjugation can be closely monitored by SDS PAGE and mass spectrometry to ensure proper conjugation of PEG molecules to the antibodies. Unreacted PEG can be separated from antibody PEG conjugates by size exclusion or by ion exchange chromatography. PEG derivatized antibodies can be tested for binding activity as well as for in vivo efficacy using methods well known to those of skill in the art for example by immunoassays described herein. Methods for pegylating proteins are known in the art and can be applied to the antibodies of the invention. See for example EP 0 154 316 by Nishimura et al. and EP 0 401 384 by Ishikawa et al.

Other modified pegylation technologies include reconstituting chemically orthogonal directed engineering technology ReCODE PEG which incorporates chemically specified side chains into biosynthetic proteins via a reconstituted system that includes tRNA synthetase and tRNA. This technology enables incorporation of more than 30 new amino acids into biosynthetic proteins in yeast and mammalian cells. The tRNA incorporates a normative amino acid any place an amber codon is positioned converting the amber from a stop codon to one that signals incorporation of the chemically specified amino acid.

Recombinant pegylation technology rPEG can also be used for serum half life extension. This technology involves genetically fusing a 300 600 amino acid unstructured protein tail to an existing pharmaceutical protein. Because the apparent molecular weight of such an unstructured protein chain is about 15 fold larger than its actual molecular weight the serum half life of the protein is greatly increased. In contrast to traditional PEGylation which requires chemical conjugation and repurification the manufacturing process is greatly simplified and the product is homogeneous.

Polysialytion is another technology which uses the natural polymer polysialic acid PSA to prolong the active life and improve the stability of therapeutic peptides and proteins. PSA is a polymer of sialic acid a sugar . When used for protein and therapeutic peptide drug delivery polysialic acid provides a protective microenvironment on conjugation. This increases the active life of the therapeutic protein in the circulation and prevents it from being recognized by the immune system. The PSA polymer is naturally found in the human body. It was adopted by certain bacteria which evolved over millions of years to coat their walls with it. These naturally polysialylated bacteria were then able by virtue of molecular mimicry to foil the body s defense system. PSA nature s ultimate stealth technology can be easily produced from such bacteria in large quantities and with predetermined physical characteristics. Bacterial PSA is completely non immunogenic even when coupled to proteins as it is chemically identical to PSA in the human body.

Another technology includes the use of hydroxyethyl starch HES derivatives linked to antibodies. HES is a modified natural polymer derived from waxy maize starch and can be metabolized by the body s enzymes. HES solutions are usually administered to substitute deficient blood volume and to improve the rheological properties of the blood. Hesylation of an antibody enables the prolongation of the circulation half life by increasing the stability of the molecule as well as by reducing renal clearance resulting in an increased biological activity. By varying different parameters such as the molecular weight of HES a wide range of HES antibody conjugates can be customized.

Antibodies having an increased half life in vivo can also be generated introducing one or more amino acid modifications i.e. substitutions insertions or deletions into an IgG constant domain or FcRn binding fragment thereof preferably a Fc or hinge Fc domain fragment . See e.g. International Publication No. WO 98 23289 International Publication No. WO 97 34631 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 277 375.

Further antibodies can be conjugated to albumin e.g. human serum albumin HSA in order to make the antibody or antibody fragment more stable in vivo or have a longer half life in vivo. The techniques are well known in the art see e.g. International Publication Nos. WO 93 15199 WO 93 15200 and WO 01 77137 and European Patent No. EPO 413622. In addition in the context of a bispecific antibody as described above the specificities of the antibody can be designed such that one binding domain of the antibody binds to Epo while a second binding domain of the antibody binds to serum albumin preferably HSA.

The strategies for increasing half life are especially useful in nanobodies fibronectin based binders and other antibodies or proteins for which increased in vivo half life is desired.

The present invention provides antibodies or fragments thereof that specifically bind to an Epo protein recombinantly fused or chemically conjugated including both covalent and non covalent conjugations to a heterologous protein or polypeptide or fragment thereof preferably to a polypeptide of at least 10 at least 20 at least 30 at least 40 at least 50 at least 60 at least 70 at least 80 at least 90 or at least 100 amino acids to generate fusion proteins. In particular the invention provides fusion proteins comprising an antigen binding fragment of an antibody described herein e.g. a Fab fragment Fd fragment Fv fragment F ab 2 fragment a VH domain a VH CDR a VL domain or a VL CDR and a heterologous protein polypeptide or peptide. Methods for fusing or conjugating proteins polypeptides or peptides to an antibody or an antibody fragment are known in the art. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 336 603 5 622 929 5 359 046 5 349 053 5 447 851 and 5 112 946 European Patent Nos. EP 0307434 and EP 0367166 International Publication Nos. WO 96 04388 and WO 91 06570 Ashkenazi et al. 1991 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 10535 10539 Zheng et al. 1995 J. Immunol. 154 5590 5600 and Vil et al. 1992 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 11337 11341.

Additional fusion proteins may be generated through the techniques of gene shuffling motif shuffling exon shuffling and or codon shuffling collectively referred to as DNA shuffling . DNA shuffling may be employed to alter the activities of antibodies of the invention or fragments thereof e.g. antibodies or fragments thereof with higher affinities and lower dissociation rates . See generally U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 605 793 5 811 238 5 830 721 5 834 252 and 5 837 458 Patten et al. 1997 Curr. Opinion Biotechnol. 8 724 33 Harayama 1998 Trends Biotechnol. 16 2 76 82 Hansson et al. 1999 J. Mol. Biol. 287 265 76 and Lorenzo and Blasco 1998 Biotechniques 24 2 308 313 each of these patents and publications are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety . Antibodies or fragments thereof or the encoded antibodies or fragments thereof may be altered by being subjected to random mutagenesis by error prone PCR random nucleotide insertion or other methods prior to recombination. A polynucleotide encoding an antibody or fragment thereof that specifically binds to an Epo protein may be recombined with one or more components motifs sections parts domains fragments etc. of one or more heterologous molecules.

Moreover the antibodies or fragments thereof can be fused to marker sequences such as a peptide to facilitate purification. In preferred embodiments the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa histidine peptide such as the tag provided in a pQE vector QIAGEN Inc. 9259 Eton Avenue Chatsworth Calif. 91311 among others many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al. 1989 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 821 824 for instance hexa histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Other peptide tags useful for purification include but are not limited to the hemagglutinin HA tag which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein Wilson et al. 1984 Cell 37 767 and the flag tag.

The present invention further encompasses uses of antibodies or fragments thereof conjugated to a therapeutic moiety. An antibody or fragment thereof may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety such as a cytotoxin e.g. a cytostatic or cytocidal agent a therapeutic agent or a radioactive metal ion e.g. alpha emitters. A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that is detrimental to cells.

Further an antibody or fragment thereof may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety or drug moiety that modifies a given biological response. Therapeutic moieties or drug moieties are not to be construed as limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents. For example the drug moiety may be a protein peptide or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include for example a toxin such as abrin ricin A pseudomonas exotoxin cholera toxin or diphtheria toxin a protein such as tumor necrosis factor interferon interferon nerve growth factor platelet derived growth factor tissue plasminogen activator an apoptotic agent an anti angiogenic agent or a biological response modifier such as for example a lymphokine.

Moreover an antibody can be conjugated to therapeutic moieties such as a radioactive metal ion such as alpha emitters such as 213Bi or macrocyclic chelators useful for conjugating radiometal ions including but not limited to 131In 131LU 131Y 131Ho 131Sm to polypeptides. In certain embodiments the macrocyclic chelator is 1 4 7 10 tetraazacyclododecane N N N N tetraacetic acid DOTA which can be attached to the antibody via a linker molecule. Such linker molecules are commonly known in the art and described in Denardo et al. 1998 Clin Cancer Res. 4 10 2483 90 Peterson et al. 1999 Bioconjug. Chem. 10 4 553 7 and Zimmerman et al. 1999 Nucl. Med. Biol. 26 8 943 50 each incorporated by reference in their entireties.

Techniques for conjugating therapeutic moieties to antibodies are well known see e.g. Amon et al.

The invention provides substantially purified nucleic acid molecules which encode polypeptides comprising segments or domains of the Epo binding antibody chains described above. Some of the nucleic acids of the invention comprise the nucleotide sequence encoding the heavy chain variable region shown in SEQ ID NO 13 33 53 or 73 and or the nucleotide sequence encoding the light chain variable region shown in SEQ ID NO 14 34 54 or 74. In a specific embodiment the nucleic acid molecules are those identified in Table 1. Some other nucleic acid molecules of the invention comprise nucleotide sequences that are substantially identical e.g. at least 65 80 95 or 99 to the nucleotide sequences of those identified in Table 1. When expressed from appropriate expression vectors polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides are capable of exhibiting Epo antigen binding capacity.

Also provided in the invention are polynucleotides which encode at least one CDR region and usually all three CDR regions from the heavy or light chain of the Epo binding antibody set forth above. Some other polynucleotides encode all or substantially all of the variable region sequence of the heavy chain and or the light chain of the Epo binding antibody set forth above. Because of the degeneracy of the code a variety of nucleic acid sequences will encode each of the immunoglobulin amino acid sequences.

The nucleic acid molecules of the invention can encode both a variable region and a constant region of the antibody. Some of nucleic acid sequences of the invention comprise nucleotides encoding a mature heavy chain sequence that is substantially identical e.g. at least 80 85 90 95 96 97 98 or 99 to the mature heavy chain sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 15 35 55 or 75. Some other nucleic acid sequences comprising nucleotide encoding a mature light chain sequence that is substantially identical e.g. at least 80 85 90 95 96 97 98 or 99 to the mature light chain sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 16 36 56 or 76.

The polynucleotide sequences can be produced by de novo solid phase DNA synthesis or by PCR mutagenesis of an existing sequence e.g. sequences as described in the Examples below encoding an Epo binding antibody or its binding fragment. Direct chemical synthesis of nucleic acids can be accomplished by methods known in the art such as the phosphotriester method of Narang et al. 1979 Meth. Enzymol. 68 90 the phosphodiester method of Brown et al. Meth. Enzymol. 68 109 1979 the diethylphosphoramidite method of Beaucage et al. Tetra. Lett. 22 1859 1981 and the solid support method of U.S. Pat. No. 4 458 066. Introducing mutations to a polynucleotide sequence by PCR can be performed as described in e.g. PCR Technology Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification H. A. Erlich Ed. Freeman Press NY N.Y. 1992 PCR Protocols A Guide to Methods and Applications Innis et al. Ed. Academic Press San Diego Calif. 1990 Mattila et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 19 967 1991 and Eckert et al. PCR Methods and Applications 1 17 1991.

Also provided in the invention are expression vectors and host cells for producing the Epo binding antibodies described above. Various expression vectors can be employed to express the polynucleotides encoding the Epo binding antibody chains or binding fragments. Both viral based and non viral expression vectors can be used to produce the antibodies in a mammalian host cell. Non viral vectors and systems include plasmids episomal vectors typically with an expression cassette for expressing a protein or RNA and human artificial chromosomes see e.g. Harrington et al. Nat Genet. 15 345 1997 . For example non viral vectors useful for expression of the Epo binding polynucleotides and polypeptides in mammalian e.g. human cells include pThioHis A B C pcDNA3.1 His pEBVHis A B C Invitrogen San Diego Calif. MPSV vectors and numerous other vectors known in the art for expressing other proteins. Useful viral vectors include vectors based on retroviruses adenoviruses adenoassociated viruses herpes viruses vectors based on SV40 papilloma virus HBP Epstein Barr virus vaccinia virus vectors and Semliki Forest virus SFV . See Brent et al. supra Smith Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 49 807 1995 and Rosenfeld et al. Cell 68 143 1992.

The choice of expression vector depends on the intended host cells in which the vector is to be expressed. Typically the expression vectors contain a promoter and other regulatory sequences e.g. enhancers that are operably linked to the polynucleotides encoding an Epo binding antibody chain or fragment. In some embodiments an inducible promoter is employed to prevent expression of inserted sequences except under inducing conditions. Inducible promoters include e.g. arabinose lacZ metallothionein promoter or a heat shock promoter. Cultures of transformed organisms can be expanded under non inducing conditions without biasing the population for coding sequences whose expression products are better tolerated by the host cells. In addition to promoters other regulatory elements may also be required or desired for efficient expression of an Epo binding antibody chain or fragment. These elements typically include an ATG initiation codon and adjacent ribosome binding site or other sequences. In addition the efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of enhancers appropriate to the cell system in use see e.g. Scharf et al. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 20 125 1994 and Bittner et al. Meth. Enzymol. 153 516 1987 . For example the SV40 enhancer or CMV enhancer may be used to increase expression in mammalian host cells.

The expression vectors may also provide a secretion signal sequence position to form a fusion protein with polypeptides encoded by inserted Epo binding antibody sequences. More often the inserted Epo binding antibody sequences are linked to a signal sequences before inclusion in the vector. Vectors to be used to receive sequences encoding Epo binding antibody light and heavy chain variable domains sometimes also encode constant regions or parts thereof. Such vectors allow expression of the variable regions as fusion proteins with the constant regions thereby leading to production of intact antibodies or fragments thereof. Typically such constant regions are human.

The host cells for harboring and expressing the Epo binding antibody chains can be either prokaryotic or eukaryotic. is one prokaryotic host useful for cloning and expressing the polynucleotides of the present invention. Other microbial hosts suitable for use include bacilli such as and other enterobacteriaceae such as and various species. In these prokaryotic hosts one can also make expression vectors which typically contain expression control sequences compatible with the host cell e.g. an origin of replication . In addition any number of a variety of well known promoters will be present such as the lactose promoter system a tryptophan trp promoter system a beta lactamase promoter system or a promoter system from phage lambda. The promoters typically control expression optionally with an operator sequence and have ribosome binding site sequences and the like for initiating and completing transcription and translation. Other microbes such as yeast can also be employed to express Epo binding polypeptides of the invention. Insect cells in combination with baculovirus vectors can also be used.

In some preferred embodiments mammalian host cells are used to express and produce the Epo binding polypeptides of the present invention. For example they can be either a hybridoma cell line expressing endogenous immunoglobulin genes e.g. the 1D6.C9 myeloma hybridoma clone as described in the Examples or a mammalian cell line harboring an exogenous expression vector e.g. the SP2 0 myeloma cells exemplified below . These include any normal mortal or normal or abnormal immortal animal or human cell. For example a number of suitable host cell lines capable of secreting intact immunoglobulins have been developed including the CHO cell lines various Cos cell lines HeLa cells myeloma cell lines transformed B cells and hybridomas. The use of mammalian tissue cell culture to express polypeptides is discussed generally in e.g. Winnacker FROM GENES TO CLONES VCH Publishers N.Y. N.Y. 1987. Expression vectors for mammalian host cells can include expression control sequences such as an origin of replication a promoter and an enhancer see e.g. Queen et al. Immunol. Rev. 89 49 68 1986 and necessary processing information sites such as ribosome binding sites RNA splice sites polyadenylation sites and transcriptional terminator sequences. These expression vectors usually contain promoters derived from mammalian genes or from mammalian viruses. Suitable promoters may be constitutive cell type specific stage specific and or modulatable or regulatable. Useful promoters include but are not limited to the metallothionein promoter the constitutive adenovirus major late promoter the dexamethasone inducible MMTV promoter the SV40 promoter the MRP poIIII promoter the constitutive MPSV promoter the tetracycline inducible CMV promoter such as the human immediate early CMV promoter the constitutive CMV promoter and promoter enhancer combinations known in the art.

Methods for introducing expression vectors containing the polynucleotide sequences of interest vary depending on the type of cellular host. For example calcium chloride transfection is commonly utilized for prokaryotic cells whereas calcium phosphate treatment or electroporation may be used for other cellular hosts. See generally Sambrook et al. supra . Other methods include e.g. electroporation calcium phosphate treatment liposome mediated transformation injection and microinjection ballistic methods virosomes immunoliposomes polycation nucleic acid conjugates naked DNA artificial virions fusion to the herpes virus structural protein VP22 Elliot and O Hare Cell 88 223 1997 agent enhanced uptake of DNA and ex vivo transduction. For long term high yield production of recombinant proteins stable expression will often be desired. For example cell lines which stably express Epo binding antibody chains or binding fragments can be prepared using expression vectors of the invention which contain viral origins of replication or endogenous expression elements and a selectable marker gene. Following the introduction of the vector cells may be allowed to grow for 1 2 days in an enriched media before they are switched to selective media. The purpose of the selectable marker is to confer resistance to selection and its presence allows growth of cells which successfully express the introduced sequences in selective media. Resistant stably transfected cells can be proliferated using tissue culture techniques appropriate to the cell type.

Monoclonal antibodies mAbs can be produced by a variety of techniques including conventional monoclonal antibody methodology e.g. the standard somatic cell hybridization technique of Kohler and Milstein 1975 Nature 256 495. Many techniques for producing monoclonal antibody can be employed e.g. viral or oncogenic transformation of B lymphocytes.

Animal systems for preparing hybridomas include the murine rat and rabbit systems. Hybridoma production in the mouse is a well established procedure. Immunization protocols and techniques for isolation of immunized splenocytes for fusion are known in the art. Fusion partners e.g. murine myeloma cells and fusion procedures are also known.

Chimeric or humanized antibodies of the present invention can be prepared based on the sequence of a murine monoclonal antibody prepared as described above. DNA encoding the heavy and light chain immunoglobulins can be obtained from the murine hybridoma of interest and engineered to contain non murine e.g. human immunoglobulin sequences using standard molecular biology techniques. For example to create a chimeric antibody the murine variable regions can be linked to human constant regions using methods known in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 to Cabilly et al. . To create a humanized antibody the murine CDR regions can be inserted into a human framework using methods known in the art. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 225 539 to Winter and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 530 101 5 585 089 5 693 762 and 6 180 370 to Queen et al.

In a certain embodiment the antibodies of the invention are human monoclonal antibodies. Such human monoclonal antibodies directed against Epo can be generated using transgenic or transchromosomic mice carrying parts of the human immune system rather than the mouse system. These transgenic and transchromosomic mice include mice referred to herein as HuMAb mice and KM mice respectively and are collectively referred to herein as human Ig mice. 

The HuMAb Mouse Medarex Inc. contains human immunoglobulin gene miniloci that encode un rearranged human heavy and and light chain immunoglobulin sequences together with targeted mutations that inactivate the endogenous and chain loci see e.g. Lonberg et al. 1994 Nature 368 6474 856 859 . Accordingly the mice exhibit reduced expression of mouse IgM or and in response to immunization the introduced human heavy and light chain transgenes undergo class switching and somatic mutation to generate high affinity human IgG monoclonal Lonberg N. et al. 1994 supra reviewed in Lonberg N. 1994 Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology 113 49 101 Lonberg N. and Huszar D. 1995 Intern. Rev. Immunol. 13 65 93 and Harding F. and Lonberg N. 1995 Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 764 536 546 . The preparation and use of HuMAb mice and the genomic modifications carried by such mice is further described in Taylor L. et al. 1992 Nucleic Acids Research 20 6287 6295 Chen J. et at. 1993 International Immunology 5 647 656 Tuaillon et al. 1993 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94 3720 3724 Choi et al. 1993 Nature Genetics 4 117 123 Chen J. et al. 1993 EMBO J. 12 821 830 Tuaillon et al. 1994 J. Immunol. 152 2912 2920 Taylor L. et al. 1994 International Immunology 579 591 and Fishwild D. et al. 1996 Nature Biotechnology 14 845 851 the contents of all of which are hereby specifically incorporated by reference in their entirety. See further U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 545 806 5 569 825 5 625 126 5 633 425 5 789 650 5 877 397 5 661 016 5 814 318 5 874 299 and 5 770 429 all to Lonberg and Kay U.S. Pat. No. 5 545 807 to Surani et al. PCT Publication Nos. WO 92103918 WO 93 12227 WO 94 25585 WO 97113852 WO 98 24884 and WO 99 45962 all to Lonberg and Kay and PCT Publication No. WO 01 14424 to Korman et al.

In another embodiment human antibodies of the invention can be raised using a mouse that carries human immunoglobulin sequences on transgenes and transchromosomes such as a mouse that carries a human heavy chain transgene and a human light chain transchromosome. Such mice referred to herein as KM mice are described in detail in PCT Publication WO 02 43478 to Ishida et al.

Still further alternative transgenic animal systems expressing human immunoglobulin genes are available in the art and can be used to raise Epo binding antibodies of the invention. For example an alternative transgenic system referred to as the Xenomouse Abgenix Inc. can be used. Such mice are described in e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 939 598 6 075 181 6 114 598 6 150 584 and 6 162 963 to Kucherlapati et al.

Moreover alternative transchromosomic animal systems expressing human immunoglobulin genes are available in the art and can be used to raise Epo binding antibodies of the invention. For example mice carrying both a human heavy chain transchromosome and a human light chain transchromosome referred to as TC mice can be used such mice are described in Tomizuka et al. 2000 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97 722 727. Furthermore cows carrying human heavy and light chain transchromosomes have been described in the art Kuroiwa et al. 2002 Nature Biotechnology 20 889 894 and can be used to raise Epo binding antibodies of the invention.

Human monoclonal antibodies of the invention can also be prepared using phage display methods for screening libraries of human immunoglobulin genes. Such phage display methods for isolating human antibodies are established in the art or described in the examples below. See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 223 409 5 403 484 and 5 571 698 to Ladner et al. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 427 908 and 5 580 717 to Dower et al. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 969 108 and 6 172 197 to McCafferty et al. and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 885 793 6 521 404 6 544 731 6 555 313 6 582 915 and 6 593 081 to Griffiths et al.

Human monoclonal antibodies of the invention can also be prepared using SCID mice into which human immune cells have been reconstituted such that a human antibody response can be generated upon immunization. Such mice are described in for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 476 996 and 5 698 767 to Wilson et al.

Engineered antibodies of the invention include those in which modifications have been made to framework residues within VH and or VL e.g. to improve the properties of the antibody. Typically such framework modifications are made to decrease the immunogenicity of the antibody. For example one approach is to backmutate one or more framework residues to the corresponding germline sequence. More specifically an antibody that has undergone somatic mutation may contain framework residues that differ from the germline sequence from which the antibody is derived. Such residues can be identified by comparing the antibody framework sequences to the germline sequences from which the antibody is derived. To return the framework region sequences to their germline configuration the somatic mutations can be backmutated to the germline sequence by for example site directed mutagenesis. Such backmutated antibodies are also intended to be encompassed by the invention.

Another type of framework modification involves mutating one or more residues within the framework region or even within one or more CDR regions to remove T cell epitopes to thereby reduce the potential immunogenicity of the antibody. This approach is also referred to as deimmunization and is described in further detail in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20030153043 by Carr et al.

In addition or alternative to modifications made within the framework or CDR regions antibodies of the invention may be engineered to include modifications within the Fc region typically to alter one or more functional properties of the antibody such as serum half life complement fixation Fc receptor binding and or antigen dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Furthermore an antibody of the invention may be chemically modified e.g. one or more chemical moieties can be attached to the antibody or be modified to alter its glycosylation again to alter one or more functional properties of the antibody. Each of these embodiments is described in further detail below. The numbering of residues in the Fc region is that of the EU index of Kabat.

In one embodiment the hinge region of CH1 is modified such that the number of cysteine residues in the hinge region is altered e.g. increased or decreased. This approach is described further in U.S. Pat. No. 5 677 425 by Bodmer et al. The number of cysteine residues in the hinge region of CH1 is altered to for example facilitate assembly of the light and heavy chains or to increase or decrease the stability of the antibody.

In another embodiment the Fc hinge region of an antibody is mutated to decrease the biological half life of the antibody. More specifically one or more amino acid mutations are introduced into the CH2 CH3 domain interface region of the Fc hinge fragment such that the antibody has impaired Staphylococcyl protein A SpA binding relative to native Fc hinge domain SpA binding. This approach is described in further detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6 165 745 by Ward et al.

In another embodiment the antibody is modified to increase its biological half life. Various approaches are possible. For example one or more of the following mutations can be introduced T252L T254S T256F as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 277 375 to Ward. Alternatively to increase the biological half life the antibody can be altered within the CH1 or CL region to contain a salvage receptor binding epitope taken from two loops of a CH2 domain of an Fc region of an IgG as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 869 046 and 6 121 022 by Presta et al.

In yet other embodiments the Fc region is altered by replacing at least one amino acid residue with a different amino acid residue to alter the effector functions of the antibody. For example one or more amino acids can be replaced with a different amino acid residue such that the antibody has an altered affinity for an effector ligand but retains the antigen binding ability of the parent antibody. The effector ligand to which affinity is altered can be for example an Fc receptor or the C1 component of complement. This approach is described in further detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 624 821 and 5 648 260 both by Winter et al.

In another embodiment one or more amino acids selected from amino acid residues can be replaced with a different amino acid residue such that the antibody has altered C1q binding and or reduced or abolished complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC . This approach is described in further detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6 194 551 by Idusogie et al.

In another embodiment one or more amino acid residues are altered to thereby alter the ability of the antibody to fix complement. This approach is described further in PCT Publication WO 94 29351 by Bodmer et al.

In yet another embodiment the Fc region is modified to increase the ability of the antibody to mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC and or to increase the affinity of the antibody for an Fc receptor by modifying one or more amino acids. This approach is described further in PCT Publication WO 00 42072 by Presta. Moreover the binding sites on human IgG1 for Fc RI Fc RII Fc RIII and FcRn have been mapped and variants with improved binding have been described see Shields R. L. et al. 2001 J. Biol. Chen. 276 6591 6604 .

In still another embodiment the glycosylation of an antibody is modified. For example an aglycoslated antibody can be made i.e. the antibody lacks glycosylation . Glycosylation can be altered to for example increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen . Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by for example altering one or more sites of glycosylation within the antibody sequence. For example one or more amino acid substitutions can be made that result in elimination of one or more variable region framework glycosylation sites to thereby eliminate glycosylation at that site. Such aglycosylation may increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Such an approach is described in further detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 714 350 and 6 350 861 by Co et al.

Additionally or alternatively an antibody can be made that has an altered type of glycosylation such as a hypofucosylated antibody having reduced amounts of fucosyl residues or an antibody having increased bisecting GlcNac structures. Such altered glycosylation patterns have been demonstrated to increase the ADCC ability of antibodies. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by for example expressing the antibody in a host cell with altered glycosylation machinery. Cells with altered glycosylation machinery have been described in the art and can be used as host cells in which to express recombinant antibodies of the invention to thereby produce an antibody with altered glycosylation. For example EP 1 176 195 by Hang et al. describes a cell line with a functionally disrupted FUT8 gene which encodes a fucosyl transferase such that antibodies expressed in such a cell line exhibit hypofucosylation. PCT Publication WO 03 035835 by Presta describes a variant CHO cell line Lecl3 cells with reduced ability to attach fucose to Asn 297 linked carbohydrates also resulting in hypofucosylation of antibodies expressed in that host cell see also Shields R. L. et al. 2002J. Biol. Chem. 277 26733 26740 . PCT Publication WO 99 54342 by Umana et al. describes cell lines engineered to express glycoprotein modifying glycosyl transferases e.g. beta 1 4 N acetylglucosaminyltransferase III GnTIII such that antibodies expressed in the engineered cell lines exhibit increased bisecting GlcNac structures which results in increased ADCC activity of the antibodies see also Umana et al. 1999 Nat. Biotech. 17 176 180 .

As discussed above the Epo binding antibodies having VH and VL sequences or full length heavy and light chain sequences shown herein can be used to create new Epo binding antibodies by modifying full length heavy chain and or light chain sequences VH and or VL sequences or the constant region s attached thereto. Thus in another aspect of the invention the structural features of an Epo binding antibody of the invention are used to create structurally related Epo binding antibodies that retain at least one functional property of the antibodies of the invention such as binding to human Epo and also inhibiting one or more functional properties of Epo e.g. inhibit Epo binding to the Epo receptor inhibit Epo dependent cell proliferation .

For example one or more CDR regions of the antibodies of the present invention or mutations thereof can be combined recombinantly with known framework regions and or other CDRs to create additional recombinantly engineered Epo binding antibodies of the invention as discussed above. Other types of modifications include those described in the previous section. The starting material for the engineering method is one or more of the VH and or VL sequences provided herein or one or more CDR regions thereof. To create the engineered antibody it is not necessary to actually prepare i.e. express as a protein an antibody having one or more of the VH and or VL sequences provided herein or one or more CDR regions thereof. Rather the information contained in the sequence s is used as the starting material to create a second generation sequence s derived from the original sequence s and then the second generation sequence s is prepared and expressed as a protein.

Accordingly in another embodiment the invention provides a method for preparing a modified Epo binding antibody comprising the steps of a producing and Epo binding antibody comprising a heavy chain variable region antibody sequence having a CDR1 sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 1 21 41 and 61 a CDR2 sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 2 22 42 and 62 and or a CDR3 sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 3 23 43 and 63 and a light chain variable region antibody sequence having a CDR1 sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 4 24 44 and 64 a CDR2 sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 5 25 45 and 65 and or a CDR3 sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 6 26 46 and 66 b altering at least one amino acid residue within the heavy chain variable region antibody sequence and or the light chain variable region antibody sequence to create at least one altered antibody sequence and c expressing the altered antibody sequence as a protein.

Accordingly in another embodiment the invention provides a method for preparing an Epo binding antibody consisting of a heavy chain variable region antibody sequence having a CDR1 sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 7 27 47 and 67 a CDR2 sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 8 28 48 and 68 and or a CDR3 sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 9 29 49 and 69 and a light chain variable region antibody sequence having a CDR1 sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 10 30 50 and 70 a CDR2 sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 11 31 51 and 71 and or a CDR3 sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 12 32 52 and 72 altering at least one amino acid residue within the heavy chain variable region antibody sequence and or the light chain variable region antibody sequence to create at least one altered antibody sequence and expressing the altered antibody sequence as a protein.

Accordingly in another embodiment the invention provides a method for preparing an Epo binding antibody optimized for expression in a mammalian cell consisting of a full length heavy chain antibody sequence having a sequence selected from the group of SEQ ID NOs 15 35 55 and 75 and a full length light chain antibody sequence having a sequence selected from the group of SEQ ID NOs 16 36 56 and 76 altering at least one amino acid residue within the full length heavy chain antibody sequence and or the full length light chain antibody sequence to create at least one altered antibody sequence and expressing the altered antibody sequence as a protein. In one embodiment the alteration of the heavy or light chain is in the framework region of the heavy or light chain.

The altered antibody sequence can also be prepared by screening antibody libraries having fixed CDR3 sequences or minimal essential binding determinants as described in US20050255552 and diversity on CDR1 and CDR2 sequences. The screening can be performed according to any screening technology appropriate for screening antibodies from antibody libraries such as phage display technology.

Standard molecular biology techniques can be used to prepare and express the altered antibody sequence. The antibody encoded by the altered antibody sequence s is one that retains one some or all of the functional properties of the Epo binding antibodies described herein which functional properties include but are not limited to specifically binding to human cynomolgus rat and or mouse Epo and the antibody inhibit Epo dependent cell proliferation in a F36E and or Ba F3 EpoR cell proliferation assay.

In certain embodiments of the methods of engineering antibodies of the invention mutations can be introduced randomly or selectively along all or part of an Epo binding antibody coding sequence and the resulting modified Epo binding antibodies can be screened for binding activity and or other functional properties as described herein. Mutational methods have been described in the art. For example PCT Publication WO 02 092780 by Short describes methods for creating and screening antibody mutations using saturation mutagenesis synthetic ligation assembly or a combination thereof. Alternatively PCT Publication WO 03 074679 by Lazar et al. describes methods of using computational screening methods to optimize physiochemical properties of antibodies.

In certain embodiments of the invention antibodies have been engineered to remove sites of deamidation. Deamidation is known to cause structural and functional changes in a peptide or protein. Deamidation can result in decreased bioactivity as well as alterations in pharmacokinetics and antigenicity of the protein pharmaceutical. Anal Chem. 2005 Mar. 1 77 5 1432 9 .

In certain embodiments of the invention the antibodies have been engineered to increase pl and improve their drug like properties. The pl of a protein is a key determinant of the overall biophysical properties of a molecule. Antibodies that have low pls have been known to be less soluble less stable and prone to aggregation. Further the purification of antibodies with low pl is challenging and can be problematic especially during scale up for clinical use. Increasing the pl of the anti Epo antibodies or Fabs of the invention improved their solubility enabling the antibodies to be formulated at higher concentrations 100 mg ml . Formulation of the antibodies at high concentrations e.g. 100 mg ml offers the advantage of being able to administer higher doses of the antibodies into eyes of patients via intravitreal injections which in turn may enable reduced dosing frequency a significant advantage for treatment of chronic diseases including retinal vascular diseases. Higher pls may also increase the FcRn mediated recycling of the IgG version of the antibody thus enabling the drug to persist in the body for a longer duration requiring fewer injections. Finally the overall stability of the antibodies is significantly improved due to the higher pl resulting in longer shelf life and bioactivity in vivo. Preferably the pl is greater than or equal to 8.2.

The functional properties of the altered antibodies can be assessed using standard assays available in the art and or described herein such as those set forth in the Examples e.g. ELISAs .

Binding of Epo to the EpoR induces signaling via JAK2 kinases that lead to activation of downstream signaling pathways that include phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase PI 3K Akt MAP kinase STATS and protein kinase C Jelkmann 2007 Jelkmann 2004 . Epo or the Epo receptor EpoR have been reported to be produced endogenously by different cell types such as endothelial cells smooth muscle cells and CNS cells Ogunshola and Bogdanova 2013 . Activation of EpoR upon binding of Epo can trigger downstream signalling pathways leading to different activities such as calcium transport Korbel et al. 2004 cell survival Velly et al. 2010 neuroprotection Grimm et al. 2002 and angiogenesis Ribatti 2010 Ribatti et al. 2003 .

Treatment and or prevention of retinal vascular disease and macular edema associated with retinal vascular disease can be determined by an ophthalmologist or health care professional using clinically relevant measurements of visual function and or retinal anatomy. Treatment of conditions or disorders associated with retinal vascular disease means any action e.g. administration of an anti Epo antibody described herein that results in or is contemplated to result in the improvement or preservation of visual function and or retinal anatomy. In addition prevention as it relates to conditions or disorders associated with retinal vascular disease means any action e.g. administration of an anti Epo antibody described herein that prevents or slows a worsening in visual function retinal anatomy and or a retinal vascular disease parameter as defined herein in a patient at risk for said worsening.

Visual function may include for example visual acuity visual acuity with low illumination visual field central visual field peripheral vision contrast sensitivity dark adaptation photostress recovery color discrimination reading speed dependence on assistive devices e.g. large typeface magnifying devices telescopes facial recognition proficiency at operating a motor vehicle ability to perform one or more activities of daily living and or patient reported satisfaction related to visual function.

Exemplary measures of visual function include Snellen visual acuity ETDRS visual acuity low luminance visual acuity Amsler grid Goldmann visual field Humphrey visual field microperimetry Pelli Robson charts SKILL card Ishihara color plates Farnsworth D15 or D100 color test standard electroretinography multifocal electroretinography validated tests for reading speed facial recognition driving simulations and patient reported satisfaction. Thus treatment of vascular disease and or macular edema can be said to be achieved upon a gain of or failure to lose 2 or more lines or 10 letters of vision on an ETDRS scale. In addition treatment of vascular disease and or macular edema can be said to occur where a subject exhibits at least a 10 an increase or lack of 10 decrease in reading speed words per minute . In addition treatment of vascular disease and or macular edema can be said to occur where a subject exhibits at least a 20 increase or lack of a 20 decrease in the proportion of correctly identified plates on an Ishihara test or correctly sequenced disks on a Farnsworth test. Further treatment of retinal vascular disease and or macular edema can be said to occur if a subject has for example at least 10 decrease or lack of a 10 or more increase in time to a pre specified degree of dark adaptation. In addition treatment of retinal vascular disease and or macular edema can be said to occur where a subject exhibits for example at least a 10 reduction or lack of a 10 or more increase in total area of visual scotoma expressed as a visual angle determined by a qualified health care professional i.e. ophthalmologist .

Undesirable aspects of retinal anatomy that may be treated or prevented include for example microaneurysm macular edema cotton wool spot intraretinal microvascular abnormality IRMA capillary dropout leukocyte adhesion retinal ischemia neovascularization of the optic disk neovascularization of the posterior pole iris neovascularization intraretinal hemorrhage vitreous hemorrhage macular scar subretinal fibrosis and retinal fibrosis venous dilation vascular tortuosity vascular leakage. Thus treatment of for example macular edema can be determined by a 20 or more reduction in thickness of the central retinal sub field as measured by optical coherence tomography.

Exemplary means of assessing retinal anatomy include funduscopy fundus photography fluorescein angiography indocyanine green angiography optical coherence tomography OCT spectral domain optical coherence tomography scanning laser ophthalmoscopy confocal microscopy adaptive optics fundus autofluorescence biopsy necropsy and immunohistochemistry. Thus vascular disease and or macular edema can be said to be treated in a subject upon a 10 reduction in leakage area as determined by fluorescein angiography.

Subjects to be treated with therapeutic agents of the present invention can also be administered other therapeutic agents with known methods of treating conditions associated with diabetes mellitus such as all forms of insulin and anti hypertensive medications.

Treatment and or prevention of ocular disease such as age related macular degeneration AMD retinal vein occlusion RVO angioedema multifocal choroiditis myopic choroidal neovascularization and or retinopathy of prematurity can be determined by an ophthalmologist or health care professional using clinically relevant measurements of visual function and or retinal anatomy by any of the measures described above. Although the measures described herein don t apply to each and every ocular disease herein one of skill in the art would recognize the clinically relevant measurement of visual function and or retinal anatomy that could be used to treat the given ocular disease.

When the therapeutic agents of the present invention are administered together with another agent the two can be administered sequentially in either order or simultaneously. In some aspects an antibody of the present invention is administered to a subject who is also receiving therapy with a second agent e.g. Lucentis . In other aspects the binding molecule is administered in conjunction with surgical treatments.

Suitable agents for combination treatment with Epo binding antibodies include agents known in the art that are able to modulate the activities of VEGF VEGF receptors other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors or other entities that modulate HIF 1 mediated pathways. Other agents have been reported to inhibit these pathways include ranibizumab bevicizumab pegaptanib aflibercept pazopanib sorafinib sunitinib and rapamycin. Combination treatments with anti inflammatory agents such as corticosteroids NSAIDS and TNF inhibitors could also be beneficial in the treatment of retinal vascular disease and macular edema for example diabetic retinopathy and DME.

A combination therapy regimen may be additive or it may produce synergistic results e.g. reductions in retinopathy severity more than expected for the combined use of the two agents . In some embodiments the present invention provide a combination therapy for preventing and or treating retinal vascular diseases and macular edema specifically diabetic retinopathy including DME and or PDR as described above with an Epo binding antibody of the invention and an anti angiogenic such as anti VEGF agent.

The invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising the Epo binding antibodies intact or binding fragments formulated together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compositions can additionally contain one or more other therapeutic agents that are suitable for treating or preventing for example diabetic retinopathy. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers enhance or stabilize the composition or can be used to facilitate preparation of the composition. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include solvents dispersion media coatings antibacterial and antifungal agents isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like that are physiologically compatible.

A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be administered by a variety of methods known in the art. The route and or mode of administration vary depending upon the desired results. It is preferred that administration be intravitreal intravenous intramuscular intraperitoneal or subcutaneous or administered proximal to the site of the target. The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier should be suitable for intravitreal intravenous intramuscular subcutaneous parenteral spinal or epidermal administration e.g. by injection or infusion . Depending on the route of administration the active compound i.e. antibody bispecific and multispecific molecule may be coated in a material to protect the compound from the action of acids and other natural conditions that may inactivate the compound.

The composition should be sterile and fluid. Proper fluidity can be maintained for example by use of coating such as lecithin by maintenance of required particle size in the case of dispersion and by use of surfactants. In many cases it is preferable to include isotonic agents for example sugars polyalcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol and sodium chloride in the composition. Long term absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption for example aluminum monostearate or gelatin.

Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be prepared in accordance with methods well known and routinely practiced in the art. See e.g. Remington The Science and Practice of Pharmacy Mack Publishing Co. 20th ed. 2000 and Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems J. R. Robinson ed. Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1978. Pharmaceutical compositions are preferably manufactured under GMP conditions. Typically a therapeutically effective dose or efficacious dose of the Epo binding antibody is employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. The Epo binding antibodies are formulated into pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art. Dosage regimens are adjusted to provide the optimum desired response e.g. a therapeutic response . For example a single bolus may be administered several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated each unit contains a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier.

Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient composition and mode of administration without being toxic to the patient. The selected dosage level depends upon a variety of pharmacokinetic factors including the activity of the particular compositions of the present invention employed or the ester salt or amide thereof the route of administration the time of administration the rate of excretion of the particular compound being employed the duration of the treatment other drugs compounds and or materials used in combination with the particular compositions employed the age sex weight condition general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated and like factors.

A physician or veterinarian can start doses of the antibodies of the invention employed in the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. In general effective doses of the compositions of the present invention for the treatment of a retinal vascular disease described herein vary depending upon many different factors including means of administration target site physiological state of the patient whether the patient is human or an animal other medications administered and whether treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. Treatment dosages need to be titrated to optimize safety and efficacy. For systemic administration with an antibody the dosage ranges from about 0.0001 to 100 mg kg and more usually 0.01 to 15 mg kg of the host body weight. For intravitreal administration with an antibody the dosage may range from 0.1 mg eye to 10 mg eye. More specifically the dose may range from 1 mg eye to 9 mg eye 2 mg eye to 8 mg eye 3 mg eye to 7 mg eye 4 mg eye to 6 mg eye or 4.5 mg eye to 5.5 mg eye. In certain instances the does may be 0.1 mg eye 0.2 mg eye 0.3 mg eye 0.4 mg eye 0.5 mg eye 0.6 mg eye 0.7 mg eye 0.8 mg eye 0.9 mg eye 1 mg eye 2 mg eye 3 mg eye 4 mg eye 5 mg eye 6 mg eye 7 mg eye 8 mg eye 9 mg eye or 10 mg eye. An exemplary treatment regime entails systemic administration once per every two weeks or once a month or once every 3 to 6 months. An exemplary treatment regime entails systemic administration once per every two weeks or once a month or once every 3 to 6 months or as needed PRN .

Antibody is usually administered on multiple occasions. Intervals between single dosages can be weekly monthly or yearly. Intervals can also be irregular as indicated by measuring blood levels of Epo binding antibody in the patient. In addition alternative dosing intervals can be determined by a physician and administered monthly or as necessary to be efficacious. Efficacy is based on lesion growth rate of Lucentis rescue retinal thickness as determined by Optical Coherence Tomography OCT and visual acuity. In some methods of systemic administration dosage is adjusted to achieve a plasma antibody concentration of 1 1000 g ml and in some methods 25 500 g ml. Alternatively antibody can be administered as a sustained release formulation in which case less frequent administration is required. Dosage and frequency vary depending on the half life of the antibody in the patient. In general humanized antibodies show longer half life than that of chimeric antibodies and nonhuman antibodies. The dosage and frequency of administration can vary depending on whether the treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. In prophylactic applications a relatively low dosage is administered at relatively infrequent intervals over a long period of time. Some patients continue to receive treatment for the rest of their lives. In therapeutic applications a relatively high dosage at relatively short intervals is sometimes required until progression of the disease is reduced or terminated and preferably until the patient shows partial or complete amelioration of symptoms of disease. Thereafter the patient can be administered a prophylactic regime.

The following examples are provided to further illustrate the invention but not to limit its scope. Other variants of the invention will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art and are encompassed by the appended claims.

A fully human phage display library was used to generate the Epo binding antibodies described herein. Biotinylated and non biotinylated human and cynomolgus Epo were used in solution and solid phase pannings. Standard panning were performed as well as RapMAT approaches Prassler et al. 2009 Immunotherapy 1 4 571 583 . Following secondary screening and RapMAT panning clones were selected for sequence analysis and a set of 8 antibodies were selected for conversion to a FabCys format germlining pl optimization and removal of deamidation sites. FabCys generation was accomplished with a proprietary RapCLONE method. RapCLONE was performed as a two step method for convenient and efficient conversion of a large amount of Fab clones into the IgG and FabCys format. In a first cloning step a eukaryotic expression cassette was introduced into the expression vectors pMORPH 11 for HuCAL PLATINUM via BsiWI Mfel for pools or Hpal Mfel for pools digestion and subsequent ligation. This was followed by a second cloning step in which the Fab pools containing the expression cassette were digested using EcoRV Blpl and pools and subsequently cloned into the pMorph 4 IgG1f or pMorph 4 h FabCys acceptor vector for expression in mammalian cells. For this project RapCLONE was applied only on unique sequenced and characterized Fab. Therefore all clones were recovered after RapCLONE .

As mentioned above the pl of a protein is a key determinant of the overall biophysical properties of a molecule. The anti Epo Fabs identified from the phage display library had pls lower than 8.2. To improve the manufacturing properties the antibodies were specifically engineered to increase their pl and improve their drug like properties. Increasing the pl of the anti Epo Fabs improved their solubility enabling the Fabs to be formulated at higher concentrations 100 mg ml . Formulation of the Fabs at high concentrations e.g. 100 mg ml offers the advantage of being able to administer higher doses of the Fabs into eyes of patients via intravitreal injections which in turn may enable reduced dosing frequency a significant advantage for treatment of chronic ocular diseases including but not limited to wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy.

The following example describes methods that may be used to measure antibody affinity. These and other methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art.

Antibody affinity for Epo was measured by surface plasmon resonance SPR using a Biacore T200 Biacore and solution equilibrium titration SET . Explanations of each technology and corresponding mean results for Epo binding are described below. Modelling assumptions take into account concentrations of Epo in the system kinetics of Epo biosynthesis and half life as well as the desired dosing schedule and suggest that a Fab with an affinity of less than 50 pM for Epo is sufficient to lower levels of free Epo.

The kinetics of an interaction i.e. the rates of complex formation k and dissociation k can be determined from the information in a sensorgram. If binding occurs as sample passes over a prepared sensor surface the response in the sensorgram increases. If equilibrium is reached a constant signal will be seen. Replacing sample with buffer causes the bound molecules to dissociate and the response decreases. Biacore evaluation software generates the values of kand kby fitting the data to interaction models.

Three flow cells were utilized for the method run. Flow cell 1 fc1 served as the reference where no Epo Fab was captured to assess for non specific binding of the Epo to the antibody coated chip surface. Both capture and binding steps were carried out on flow cells 2 4.

Capture step In order to achieve an Rmax of 20 the capture level of anti hu Fab on fc2 4 was approximately 50 RL. Anti hu Fab at a concentration of 1 ug ul flowed over Fc2 4 at a flow rate of 10 l min.

The analyte started at concentrations of 20 nM and included 8 1 2 dilutions with a duplicate at 2.5 nM for the long and short dissociation. The analyte was run at a flow rate of 60 l min for 240 seconds. Dissociation times were set at 4000 seconds and 600 seconds. Dissociation time was set at 4000 seconds for 10 nM 2.5 nM and 0.3125 nM analyte concentrations for NVS2 and NVS4. After the sample injection there was a wash step with the regeneration buffer.

Regeneration was performed at the end of each cycle on all flow cells. Regeneration condition for this method was 1 Phosphoric acid with 10 sodium Hydroxide at 60 ul min for 100 seconds.

All other running conditions were carried out at 25 C. in 1 HBS EP buffer Biacore cat BR 1006 69 . The resulting signals were adjusted by double referencing thus subtracting the refraction index values from the reference flow cell and the binding step with no analyte. Data was collected at 10 Hz and analyzed using the Biacore T100 Evaluation Software Version 1.1 GE Healthcare . This program uses a global fitting analysis method for the determination of rate and affinity constants for each interaction.

The results of the Biacore binding kinetics determination are shown in Table 2. As shown the antibodies described herein exhibited high affinity binding to human Epo with Kvalues typically less than or equal to 40 pM.

In contrast to kinetic assays using sensor surfaces such as SPR SET is a method which determines affinities in solution. It is an equilibrium measurement that does not deliver kinetic data.

In SET a constant amount of antibody is incubated with different concentrations of antigen until equilibrium is reached. The concentration of free antibody in the equilibrated solution is determined by applying the solution on an antigen coated MSD plate Meso Scale Discovery followed by incubation with an ECL labeled secondary antibody and measurement of signal intensity. At low antigen concentrations a strong signal is achieved high concentration of free antibody which binds to the antigen on the plate whereas for high antigen concentration the antibody is completely antigen captured resulting in a low signal. If a sufficient number of antigen concentrations in a matching range are available the titration curve allows for a reasonable determination of the affinity using the appropriate fit model. For a complete titration antigen concentrations of at least 10 fold higher than the anticipated Khave to be applied. The constant concentration of antibody applied in the assay should be in the range of or below the K Table 3 .

For Kdetermination by SET monomer fractions of antibody protein were used at least 90 monomer content analyzed by analytical SEC Superdex75 Amersham Pharmacia for Fab or Tosoh G3000SWXL TOSOH BIOSCIENCE for IgG respectively .

Affinity determination in solution was basically performed as described in the literature Friguet et al. 305 19 . In order to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of the SET method it was transferred from classical ELISA to ECL based technology Haenel et al. 2005 .

Epo antibodies were diluted to a fixed concentration in incubation buffer PBS with 2 BSA Sigma cat A4503 and 1 Tween20 and 1 Triton X Sigma cat 234729 and added to a serial dilution 1 5 of Epo in incubation buffer.

Streptavidin coated standard MSD plates Meso Scale Discovery 384 well MSD cat L11SA were blocked with 25 l incubation buffer at RT for 1 hr. Plates were washed 3 in TBST buffer 25 mM TBS with 0.05 Tween20 and 0.1 g ml of biotinylated Epo was added in 25 l incubation buffer and incubated at RT for 1 hr. Plates were washed 3 in TBST buffer. Samples containing Fabs and Epo titration were added to the plate 25 l and incubated at RT for 15 min. Plates were washed 3 in TBST buffer. 25 l detection antibody was added Anti Human Goat Sulfo TAG 1 1000 in incubation buffer MSD cat R32AJ 1 and incubated at RT for 60 min. Plates were washed 3 in wash buffer and 50 l of 1 MSD Read buffer T was added with surfactant MSD cat R92TC 1 . Plates were read on a MSD Spector Imager 6000.

Data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism software v4 with background an average of wells containing no Fab subtracted from each value. X axis values concentration of Epo in solution were transformed into log 10x.

Affinities of Epo Fabs were determined using the SET assay and resulting Kvalues pM concentrations are summarized in Table 3. NVS2 bound human human darbepeotin and cynomolgus Epo with a Kless than 10 pM. NVS2 also bound mouse Epo with a Kless than 50 pM and rat Epo with a Kless than 20 pM. NVS3 bound human human darbepeotin cynomolgus mouse and rat Epo with a Kless than 5 pM. NVS4 bound human human darbepoetin cynomolgus mouse and rat Epo with a Kless than 10 pM.

Cells which are dependent on erythropoietin for growth and survival can be utilized to measure the potency of anti Epo therapeutics by means of Epo dependent proliferation inhibition Chiba et al. 1991 .

This assay demonstrates the ability of Epo antibodies to inhibit Epo induced cell proliferation in mouse Ba F3 cells expressing the Epo receptor Ba F3 EpoR cells . Ba F3 cells are IL 3 dependent for growth and survival and have been shown to grow in an IL 3 independent manner upon transformation with various oncogenic tyrosine kinases. Upon stable transfection with EpoR Ba F3 EpoR cells became IL 3 independent. The mammalian expression plasmid pcDNA3.1 carrying human EpoR was transfected into Ba F3 cells using the Amaxa nucleofection system catalogue number VCA 1003 Amaxa GmbH according to the manufacturers instructions using the Nucleofector device Amaxa Nucleofactor II .

Ba F3 EpoR cells were maintained in growth medium RPM11640 10 FBS 1 Pen Strep 100 g ml Hygromycin B 1 U ml Epo . Cells were split at 1e6cells ml every 3 4 days down to 0.4 0.6e5 cells ml.

Epo antibodies inhibited Ba F3 EpoR cells proliferation in the presence of 1 ng ml Epo after 48 hrs. Antibodies inhibited Ba F3 EpoR cell proliferation with an ICless than or equal to 350 pM.

F36E cells are highly dependent on Epo for proliferation. Stimulation with Epo using the methods described above typically results in a greater then 6 fold signal over baseline. The EC50 of this curve is 7 pM.

A proliferation assay using the F36E cell line an Epo dependent lymphocyte like immortalized cell line derived from a parental bone marrow cell line was used for screening anti Epo therapeutic antibodies and to select candidates for development.

Darbepoietin a recombinant hyperglycosylated human Epo was used for cell maintenance and proliferation assays described herein. Darbepoietin stimulates proliferation in F36E cells with a comparable EC50 to recombinant human Epo 63.2 pg ml darbepoietin and 81.25 g ml erythropoietin see LU 15432 pg. 44 . F36E cells were maintained in growth media RPMI1640 5 FBS 1 Pen Strep 5.2 U ml dEpo at minimum density 0.25e6 cells per ml to maximum density 1.0e6 cells per ml up to 10 passages.

Synthetic peptides corresponding to structural domains of human Epo hEpo domain truncations of hEpo or chimeric molecules containing portions of hEpo and human thrombopoietin TPO were synthesized or expressed recombinantly. Positive binding to the synthetic peptides indicated that residues contained in that domain of Epo were involved in binding to the anti Epo antibody. For the truncated proteins loss of binding indicated the involvement of the truncated portion in binding to the anti Epo antibody. However the loss of binding did not preclude the possibility that the truncation altered the structure of the remaining protein significantly so as to affect binding to the anti Epo antibodies. The human Epo human TPO chimeras enabled maintenance of structure while still allowing epitope mapping. Loss of binding to a variant that contained a portion of hTPO indicated that the homologous region in hEpo was important for binding to the anti Epo antibody.

Epo was de glycosylated using Protein De glycosylation Mix New England Biolabs cat P6039S . 30 mg of hEpo was combined with 1 ml of Protein Deglycosylation Mix and incubated at 37 C. for 1 hour at which point de glycosylation was incomplete as determined by SDS PAGE. An additional 0.5 ml of Protein De glycosylation Mix was then added to Epo and incubated for a further 1 hour at 37 C. Gel analysis showed near complete deglycosylation of Epo. This protein was then further purified using a 120 ml Superdex75 column GE Healthcare cat 28 9893 33 equilibrated in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5 150 mM NaCl. Elution fractions containing the highest level of de glycoslation of hEpo were pooled. Protein complexes were formed by combining 5 mg of de glycosylated Epo with 7 mg of NVS3 followed by incubation on ice for 1 hour. The protein complex mix was then concentrated and applied to a 120 ml Superdex 75 equilibrated in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5 150 mM NaCl. Fractions containing SDS gel evaluated stoichiometric ratios of Epo NVS3 were pooled and concentrated to 19 mg ml concentration estimated by LCUV PRONOVA 27SN . Crystallization screens were set up using this concentrated Epo NVS3 complex. Crystals were grown by the technique of sitting drop vapor diffusion with the drops containing equal volumes of protein and reservoir solution. Crystals formed at 4 C. with the following reservoir condition 0.1M Hepes pH7.0 12 PEG3350 50 mM zinc acetate dehydrate. Crystals were frozen using the following cryoprotection solution 0.1M Hepes pH7.0 15 PEG3350 50 mM zinc acetate dehydrate 22 glycerol.

Epo NVS3 complex crystal diffraction data were collected at beamline 17 ID at the Advanced Photon Source Argonne National Laboratory USA . Data were processed and scaled at 2.6 using autoPROC Global Phasing LTD in space group C2 with cell dimensions a 125.57 b 150.15 c 163.84A alpha 90 beta 110.81 gamma 90 . The Epo NVS3 structure was solved by molecular replacement using Phaser McCoy et al. 2007 J. Appl. Cryst. 40 658 674 . The Fab from 3H0T structure in the PDB database Berman 2000 was split into variable and constant domains and the human erythropoietin structure Syed et. al. Nature. 1998 Oct. 1 395 6701 511 6 PDB code 1EER were used as search models.

The final model which contains 3 molecule of the Epo NVS3 complex per asymmetric unit was built in COOT Emsley Cowtan 2004 Acta Cryst. 60 2126 2132 and refined to R and Rvalues of 23.0 and 26.7 respectively with an rmsd of 0.010 and 1.34 for bond lengths and bond angles respectively using PHENIX Adams et al. Acta Cryst. D66 213 221 2010 .

The crystal structure of Epo NVS3 was solved and refined to 2.6 . It revealed an asymmetric unit composed of three Epo NVS2 protein complexes each composed of one Fab bound to one Epo protein. Two of these complexes form a zinc mediated dimer and the third exhibits higher b factors and weaker density. Interactions from the Fab to Epo were mediated by the complementarity determining region CDR loops from both the heavy and light chains of NVS3. Conformational changes of Epo when compared to 1EER were limited to loops distal from the Fab binding epitope with an RMSD of 0.5 for all 144 aligned amino acids. The heavy and light chains of Fab NVS3 show typical immunoglobulin like folds for the domains.

The crystals structure of Epo NVS3 was used to identify the Epo epitope of the fragment antigen binding of NVS3. The interaction surface on Epo was formed primarily by residues comprising residue Ser Glu residues Thrthrough Argand residues Asnthrough Arg. These correspond to the secondary structure elements of Epo denoted as helix A loop A B and helix D. These residues formed the three dimensional surface that is recognized by NVS3. Interactions included backbone interactions solvent mediated interactions and direct side chain interactions.

Epo residues that contain atoms in contact with NVS3 are listed in Table 9. Contact is defined to be within 5 of NVS3 to account for potential water mediated interactions.

Intraocular injection of the anti Epo antibodies will inhibit retinal vessel dilation anti Epo antibodies to ameliorate the effects of Epo on decrease blood flow and hypoxic conditions in the retina. Thus the anti Epo antibodies are expected to reduce the retinal pathology that is also seen in patients with vascular retinal diseases such as wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy.
