The present application claims priority to and incorporates by reference the entire contents of Japanese Patent Application No. 2012 270605 filed in Japan on Dec. 11 2012.

The present invention relates to an advertisement delivery management apparatus and an advertisement delivery management method.

In recent years with the rapid spread of a network such as the Internet advertisements have been actively delivered through the network. As an aspect of the delivery of the advertisements display advertising has been known which displays image or video advertisements in a predetermined space of a page hereinafter referred to as an advertisement delivery target page which is an advertisement delivery target.

In the display advertising advertisements are delivered to a user who has user attributes for example sex age and favorite designated by an advertiser. Therefore advertisements are effectively delivered for example see Japanese Laid open Patent Publication No. 2011 238020 .

In the delivery of the advertisements when the user who has accessed the advertisement delivery target page has the user attributes designated by the advertiser advertisements are delivered. Therefore it is preferable to predict a delivery target user who will be the future advertisement delivery destination as a future log and to accept an order from the advertiser on the basis of the future log.

However it is difficult to accurately predict the delivery target user who will be the future advertisement delivery destination so as to be identical to the user who actually accesses the advertisement delivery target page. Therefore it is difficult to perform a process of accepting an advertisement delivery order request with high accuracy.

According to an exemplary embodiment an advertisement delivery management apparatus includes an acquisition unit a determination unit and an accepting unit. The acquisition unit acquires information on two or more types of delivery target user groups each including a plurality of delivery target users predicted as future advertisement delivery destinations. The determination unit determines whether each of the delivery target user groups satisfies delivery conditions designated by an advertisement delivery order request. The accepting unit accepts the advertisement delivery order request based on the determination result of the determination unit.

The above and other objects features advantages and technical and industrial significance of this invention will be better understood by reading the following detailed description of presently preferred embodiments of the invention when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings.

Hereinafter an advertisement delivery management apparatus and an advertisement delivery management method according to an exemplary embodiment hereinafter referred to as an embodiment of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The advertisement delivery management apparatus and the advertisement delivery management method according to the present disclosure are not limited by the embodiment. In the following description in some cases a database is described as a DB .

First an advertisement delivery management process according to an embodiment will be described. are diagrams illustrating the advertisement delivery management process according to the embodiment. The advertisement delivery management process makes it possible to perform a process of accepting orders from the advertiser with high accuracy.

As illustrated in an advertisement delivery management system according to the embodiment includes an advertisement delivery management apparatus an information delivery apparatus an advertiser terminal and a user terminal . The advertisement delivery management apparatus the information delivery apparatus the advertiser terminal and the user terminal are connected to each other through a communication network . The communication network is an Internet protocol IP network such as the Internet. In practice there are a plurality of advertiser terminals and a plurality of user terminals . However illustrates one advertiser terminal and one user terminal for convenience of explanation.

The advertiser terminal is a terminal apparatus of the advertiser who wants to deliver advertisements and sends an order hereinafter referred to as an order request for the advertisements to be delivered to the user terminal of the user with predetermined user attributes to the advertisement delivery management apparatus . Specifically the advertiser terminal transmits to the advertisement delivery management apparatus the order request including advertising information which the advertiser wants to post on an advertisement delivery target page and information on the designated user attributes as the delivery destinations. Examples of the advertising information include two dimensional content and three dimensional content such as banner advertisements text advertisements and video advertisements.

The user terminal is the terminal apparatus of the user who accesses the advertisement delivery management apparatus and the information delivery apparatus . When the information delivery apparatus is accessed by the user terminal for example it transmits an advertisement delivery target page such as a Web page to the user terminal . The advertisement delivery target page includes the uniform resource locator URL of the advertising information. The user terminal requests the advertisement delivery management apparatus to transmit advertising information on the basis of the URL. When receiving the request for the advertising information from the user terminal the advertisement delivery management apparatus transmits advertising information corresponding to the request to the user terminal . The URL of the advertising information is not the URL of the advertisement delivery management apparatus but may be the URL of the information delivery apparatus . In this case the user terminal requests the information delivery apparatus to transmit advertising information on the basis of the URL of the advertising information. When receiving the request the information delivery apparatus requests the advertisement delivery management apparatus to transmit advertising information to the user terminal . The advertisement delivery management apparatus transmits advertising information corresponding to the transmission request from the information delivery apparatus to the user terminal .

The advertisement delivery management apparatus performs a process of accepting an advertisement delivery order request a process of allocating user attributes corresponding to the accepted order request and a process of delivering the advertising information designated by the order request to perform processes from the reception of the advertisement delivery order to the delivery of the advertising information.

The advertisement delivery management apparatus stores information including the user attributes of a plurality of delivery target users who are predicted as the future advertisement delivery destinations as a future log prediction information in a DB and performs the process of accepting the order request on the basis of the future log.

In the example illustrated in information on delivery target users . . . hereinafter generically referred to as a delivery target user in some cases who are predicted as the future advertisement delivery destinations is stored in the DB. For example the delivery target user has user attributes A to C and the delivery target user has user attributes A B and E. In addition the delivery target user has user attributes B D and E.

The advertisement delivery management apparatus repeatedly performs a process of randomly selecting a predetermined ratio R for example R 0.8 of delivery target users to the delivery target users . . . to acquire information on two or more types of delivery target user groups. In the example illustrated in the advertisement delivery management apparatus acquires information on different delivery target user groups . . . hereinafter generically referred to as a delivery target user group in some cases from a future log .

As illustrated in when receiving an advertisement delivery order request from the advertiser terminal the advertisement delivery management apparatus determines whether each of the delivery target user groups to satisfies the delivery conditions designated by the order request .

The delivery conditions designated by the order request include for example user attributes and the number of postings. For example it is assumed that the user attribute is an attribute A and the number of postings is 1000 . In addition it is assumed that the number of delivery target users having the attribute A as the user attribute is 1200 in the delivery target user group is 1120 in the delivery target user group and is 980 in the delivery target user group .

In this case the delivery target user groups which satisfy the delivery conditions designated by the advertisement delivery order request are for example the delivery target user groups and . In contrast the delivery target user group includes 980 delivery target users having the user attribute A and does not satisfy 1000 which is the number of postings designated by the order request .

The advertisement delivery management apparatus accepts the order request when the ratio of the delivery target user groups which satisfy the delivery conditions designated by the order request to the delivery target user groups to is equal to or greater than a predetermined value R for example R 0.9 . On the other hand when the ratio of the delivery target user groups which satisfy the delivery conditions designated by the order request is less than the predetermined value R the advertisement delivery management apparatus does not accept the order request .

As such the advertisement delivery management apparatus determines whether to accept the order request on the basis of whether delivery target user groups to each including a plurality of delivery target users predicted as the future advertisement delivery destinations satisfy the delivery conditions designated by the advertisement delivery order request . Therefore it is possible to perform the process of determining whether the delivery conditions designated by the order request are satisfied for a plurality of prediction patterns. As a result it is possible to improve the reception accuracy of the order request as compared to when the determination is performed for one prediction pattern.

In addition the advertisement delivery management apparatus randomly selects a predetermined ratio R of the delivery target users to the delivery target users . . . included in the future log to acquire information on delivery target user groups to . Therefore it is possible to easily generate different prediction patterns. In this embodiment the delivery target users are randomly selected. However for example the delivery target users may be selected on the basis of a predetermined rule. In addition plural types of future logs may be predicted and the plural types of future logs may be used as the delivery target user groups to .

When the ratio of the delivery target user groups satisfying the delivery conditions to the delivery target user groups to is equal to or greater than the predetermined value R the advertisement delivery management apparatus accepts the advertisement delivery order request . Therefore it is possible to further improve the reception accuracy of the order request . That is as the number of delivery target user groups increases the ratio of the delivery target user groups satisfying the delivery conditions designated by the order request is reduced. As a result there is a concern that the reception accuracy of the order request will be reduced. However it is possible to improve the reception accuracy of the order request by adjusting the predetermined value R.

Next the detailed structure of the advertisement delivery management apparatus which performs the above mentioned advertisement delivery management process and the detailed content of the process will be described with reference to the drawings.

The communication unit is an interface such as a network interface card NIC . The control unit transmits and receives various kinds of information to and from the advertiser terminal or the user terminal through the communication unit and the communication network . The advertising information DB the user information DB the past log DB and the future log DB are each a semiconductor memory device such as a hard disk a random access memory RAM or a flash memory or a storage device such as an optical disk.

The control unit is implemented by an integrated circuit such as an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or a field programmable gate array FPGA . A central processing unit CPU or a micro processing unit MPU executes a program stored in the storage device using the RAM as a work area to cause the control unit to function as the advertisement delivery unit the future log prediction unit the accepting unit and the allocation unit . The structure of the control unit is not limited thereto but the control unit may have any structure as long as it can perform the following information processing.

When a request to deliver advertising information is received from the user terminal the advertisement delivery unit acquires advertising information corresponding to the user attributes of the user of the user terminal from an advertising information table in the advertising information DB and transmits the acquired advertising information from the communication unit to the user terminal which is a delivery request source.

The advertisement ID is identification information which is allocated to each accepted order request. The user attributes are user attributes designated by the order request. The posting period is the period for which the advertising information designated by the order request is delivered. The number of postings is the number of deliveries of the advertising information designated by the order request. In addition the advertising information is advertising information designated by the order request.

For example an advertisement ID A indicates that the user attribute of a delivery target is a vehicle the delivery period of advertising information is from Jan. 1 2013 to Jan. 31 2013 the number of times the advertising information is delivered is 1000 and the advertising information is a banner advertisement Ya . When the number of deliveries of the advertising information is greater than 1000 within the delivery period of the advertising information the process of delivering the advertising information corresponding to the order request ends.

When the user of the user terminal who transmitted the advertising information delivery request has the user attribute vehicle for example the advertisement delivery unit acquires the advertising information banner advertisement Ya of the advertisement ID A from the advertising information table in the advertising information DB and transmits the acquired advertising information to the user terminal which is a delivery request source.

The user attributes of the user of the user terminal are determined on the basis of the user information table in the user information DB . is a diagram illustrating an example of the user information table stored in the user information DB . As illustrated in the user information table includes information such as a user ID psychographic attributes and demographic attributes .

The user ID is identification information for identifying the user of the user terminal . The user ID corresponds to for example user identification information which is set to a hypertext transfer protocol HTTP cookie transmitted and received between the advertisement delivery management apparatus and the user terminal .

The psychographic attributes are information indicating for example the values lifestyle character and preference of the user. The psychographic attributes are classified into for example attributes vehicle cosmetics clothes and travel . In the example illustrated in 1 is set to each attribute when the preference of the user is a relatively high and 0 is set to each attribute in the other cases. In addition the psychographic attributes are not limited to the attributes illustrated in but may include various attributes such as economy politics baseball soccer other sports sweets a personal computer white goods and furniture.

The demographic attributes indicate demographic user attribute information. The demographic attributes are classified into for example attributes sex and age of the user. In 1 is stored in the attribute sex when the user is a female and 2 is stored in the attribute sex when the user is a male. The age of the user is stored in the attribute age . The demographic attributes are not limited to the attributes illustrated in but may include various attributes such as the job family structure annual income address native place and academic background of the user.

For example when the user with a user ID U illustrated in transmits an advertising information delivery request from the user terminal it is determined that the user attributes of the user are for example vehicle travel male and 21 years old . In addition for example when the user with a user ID U illustrated in transmits an advertising information delivery request from the user terminal the advertisement delivery unit determines that the user attributes of the user are clothes female and 44 years old .

The advertisement delivery unit sets the user ID of the user who transmits the advertising information delivery request in an access log table in the past log DB . is a diagram illustrating an example of the access log table stored in the past log DB .

As illustrated in the access log table is a table in which that associates the date and time when the user transmits the advertisement information delivery request to the advertisement delivery management apparatus with the user ID is set. The advertisement delivery unit updates the access log table whenever the advertising information delivery request is received from the user terminal .

When a request to transmit advertising information to the user terminal is received from the information delivery apparatus similarly the advertisement delivery unit acquires advertising information corresponding to the user attributes of the user of the user terminal from the advertising information table in the advertising information DB and transmits the acquired advertising information from the communication unit to the user terminal . The transmission request from the information delivery apparatus includes the user ID of the user of the user terminal . The advertisement delivery unit acquires advertising information corresponding to the user attributes of the user of the user terminal from the advertising information table on the basis of the user ID.

The future log prediction unit determines a plurality of delivery target users who are predicted as the future advertisement delivery destinations on the basis of the access log table stored in the past log DB and sets the user information of the determined delivery target users in a future log table stored in the future log DB .

The delivery target ID is identification information allocated to each delivery target user who is predicted as the future advertisement delivery destination. The delivery target user is a virtual user who is different from the user set in the user information table stored in the user information DB .

The allocation state is information indicating whether the delivery target user has been allocated to the order request. When a delivery target user hereinafter referred to as an allocated user in some cases has been allocated to the order request 1 is set to the allocation state . When a delivery target user hereinafter referred to as a non allocated user in some cases has not been allocated for the order request 0 is set to the allocation state .

The psychographic attributes and the demographic attributes are the same as those in the user information table in the user information DB . The user who is set in the user information table may be presumed as the delivery target user and the delivery target ID may be used as the user ID. In this case information on the psychographic attributes and the demographic attributes can be acquired from the user information table on the basis of the user ID.

The future log prediction unit can predict the delivery target user who will be the advertisement delivery destination for a predetermined future period on the basis of for example the access log in the same period last year or the access log in the previous predetermined period. For example the future log prediction unit can presume the user who transmitted the advertising information delivery request for the last month as the delivery target user for the next month.

The future log prediction unit can perform a statistical process for the past log which is set in the access log table to determine the tendency of the delivery target user who will be the future advertisement delivery destination and predict the future log on the basis of the determination result. In this case for example the future log prediction unit may determine the tendency of the delivery target user considering for example weather or temperature change information.

The future log prediction unit can set the predicted future log in the future log table. In addition the future log prediction unit may set the future log which is acquired from an external apparatus through the communication unit in the future log table.

In addition a plurality of future log prediction units which predict the delivery target users according to different rules may be provided. In this case it is possible to acquire information on a plurality of different future logs hereinafter referred to as prediction patterns in some cases .

The accepting unit determines whether to accept the order request from the advertiser terminal on the basis of the future log set in the future log table. When it is determined that the order request is accepted the accepting unit transmits a response to the reception of the order to the advertiser terminal . As described above the order request from the advertiser terminal includes designated information such as the user attributes and the number of postings.

The accepting process of the accepting unit includes for example a process of acquiring the delivery target user group a process of determining whether each delivery target user group satisfies the delivery conditions designated by the order request and a process of determining whether to accept the order request. Hereinafter each process will be described specifically.

First the process of acquiring the delivery target user group will be described. In the process the accepting unit repeatedly performs a process of randomly selecting a predetermined ratio R of the non allocated users to the non allocated users included in the future log table to acquire information on two or more types of delivery target user groups.

For example it is assumed that the number of non allocated users in the future log table is 1000 and the predetermined ratio R is set to 0.08 . In this case the accepting unit repeatedly performs the process of selecting the non allocated users from the future log table 800 times 1000 0.8 m times m is an integer equal to or greater than 2 .

In this way the accepting unit can acquire information on m delivery target user groups each including 800 non allocated users from the future log table. Whenever the predetermined ratio R of the non allocated users is selected the accepting unit sets the selected non allocated users as a delivery target user group in the delivery target user group table. is a diagram illustrating an example of the delivery target user group table.

In this way it is possible to easily generate different future logs prediction patterns on the basis of the future log table. That is when the future log prediction unit generates two or more types of future logs two or more types of different prediction rules are needed. However the delivery target user is sampled from the future log table to prevent an increase in the number of prediction rules in the future log prediction unit .

Since the delivery target user is sampled from the future log table the delivery target user group acquired by the accepting unit is associated with the delivery tendency of the user attributes in the future log table. Therefore for example when the prediction accuracy of the future log prediction unit is high it is possible to accept the order request with high accuracy in the reception determination process.

As the number of delivery target users forming the delivery target user group is reduced the association of the delivery target users with the delivery tendency of the user attributes in the future log table is reduced which makes it possible to change the association between the prediction patterns depending on the number of non allocated users. Therefore as the number of delivery target users is reduced a process of determining whether the delivery conditions are satisfied which will be described below becomes stricter. As a result it is possible to accept the order request with high accuracy in the reception determination process.

The predetermined ratio R can be set to the control unit by the administrator of the advertisement delivery management apparatus through an operation unit not illustrated . In addition the accepting unit may change the predetermined ratio R depending on the number of non allocated users in the future log table.

For example when the number of non allocated users in the future log table is relatively large the accepting unit increases the predetermined ratio R. When the number of non allocated users in the future log table is relatively small the accepting unit decreases the predetermined ratio R. In this way it is possible to improve the accuracy of the accepting process.

In the process of acquiring the delivery target user group the accepting unit may select the delivery target user according other different rules instead of randomly selecting the delivery target user. For example the accepting unit can randomly remove a predetermined ratio R 1 R of the non allocated users to the non allocated users included in the future log table and form the delivery target user group with the remaining non allocated users.

For example the accepting unit may acquire as the delivery target user group the non allocated users except for a plurality of k th 1 k m rows among rows of the non allocated users in the future log table. For example it is assumed that the predetermined ratio R is 0.8 and m is 10 .

In this case the accepting unit excludes the non allocated users which are set in the rows in which the last digit is 1 and 2 such as the third to tenth tows the thirteenth to twentieth rows . . . for the first delivery target user group in the future log table. In addition the accepting unit excludes the non allocated users which are set in the rows in which the last digit is 2 and 3 such as the first row the fourth to tenth rows the eleventh row the fourteenth to twentieth rows . . . for the second delivery target user group in the future log table.

The accepting unit may repeatedly perform a process of randomly selecting the predetermined ratio R of the non allocated users to the non allocated users included in the future log table and multiplying the selected non allocated users by a predetermined coefficient K 1 to acquire information on two or more types of delivery target user groups. The accepting unit sets the predetermined coefficient K to for example 1 R. The predetermined ratio R is preferably set such that the predetermined coefficient K is an integer when the predetermined coefficient K is 1 R.

As such when the predetermined coefficient K is multiplied the accepting unit can accurately set the delivery target user group corresponding to the number of non allocated users included in the future log table. When the predetermined coefficient K which is not an integer is multiplied there is a concern a decimal fraction will be included in the number of non allocated users forming the delivery target user group. Therefore the accepting unit can round off cut off or round up a value obtained by multiplying the number of non allocated users forming the delivery target user group by the predetermined coefficient K on the basis of for example predetermined conditions. In this way the total number of non allocated users forming each delivery target user group can be equal or substantially equal to the total number of non allocated users in the future log table.

As described above when a plurality of future log prediction units generate two or more types of future logs the accepting unit can acquire the two or more types of future logs as two or more types of delivery target user groups with no change from the future log prediction unit .

Next a process of determining whether each delivery target user group satisfies the delivery conditions designated by the order request will be described. In the process the accepting unit determines whether two or more types of delivery target user groups each satisfy the delivery conditions designated by the advertisement delivery order request.

Specifically the accepting unit counts the number of delivery target users with the user attributes designated by the order request among the delivery target users in the delivery target user group. When the count result is equal to or greater than the number of postings designated by the order request the accepting unit determines that the delivery conditions designated by the order request are satisfied.

For example when the user attribute designated by the order request is vehicle and the number of postings is 1000 the accepting unit counts the number of delivery target users with the attribute vehicle to which 1 is set among the delivery target users in each delivery target user group. When the count result is equal to or greater than 1000 the accepting unit determines that the delivery target user group satisfies the delivery conditions designated by the order request. When the count result is less than 1000 the accepting unit determines that the delivery target user group does not satisfy the delivery conditions designated by the order request.

The accepting unit counts a combination of two or more user attributes whose frequency is designated by the order request and is equal to or greater than a threshold value as one user attribute hereinafter referred to as a combined user attribute in some cases . For example when the frequency of a combination of the user attributes clothes and travel which is designated by the order request is high the accepting unit counts the combination of the user attributes clothes and travel as one user attribute.

Information on the order request accepted by the accepting unit is set in the advertising information table stored in the advertising information DB . The accepting unit can determine a combination of two or more user attributes whose frequency is designated by the order request and is equal to or greater than a threshold value on the basis of the advertising information table.

For example the accepting unit determines the total number of postings designated by the past order request as a first sum on the basis of the advertising information table and determines the total number of postings designated by the past order request as a second sum for each combination of two or more user attributes. Then the accepting unit counts as one user attribute a combination of the user attributes in which the ratio of the second sum to the first sum is equal to or greater than a predetermined threshold value.

When the frequency of the combination of the user attributes clothes and travel which is designated by the order request is high and the future log table is in the state illustrated in the user attribute of the delivery target user with a delivery target ID F is not clothes or travel but is clothes travel .

The combination of two or more user attributes whose frequency is designated by the order request and is equal to or greater than a threshold value may not be determined by the accepting unit but may be set in a separate user information DB by an external apparatus.

For example when the number of non allocated users in the future log table is equal to or less than a predetermined value or when the number of non allocated users with the combined user attribute is equal to or less than a predetermined value the accepting unit can divide the combined user attribute into a plurality of user attributes. Therefore it is possible to increase the total number of user attributes. As a result the possibility that the order request designating the combined user attribute will be accepted is reduced but it is possible to increase the possibility that other order requests will be accepted.

Next a process of determining whether to accept the order request will be described. In the process the accepting unit determines whether to accept the advertisement delivery order request on the basis of the above mentioned satisfaction determination process.

Specifically when the ratio of the delivery target user groups satisfying the delivery conditions to the two or more types of delivery target user groups is equal to or greater than the predetermined value R the accepting unit accepts the advertisement delivery order request. For example in a case in which the number of delivery target user groups is 10 and the predetermined value R is 0.8 when the number of delivery target user groups satisfying the delivery conditions is equal to or greater than 8 the accepting unit accepts the advertisement delivery order request.

The predetermined value R can be set in the control unit by the administrator of the advertisement delivery management apparatus through the operation unit not illustrated . In addition the accepting unit may change the predetermined value R depending on the number of non allocated users in the future log table.

For example when the number of non allocated users in the future log table is relatively large the accepting unit decreases the predetermined value R. When the number of non allocated users in the future log table is relatively small the accepting unit increases the predetermined value R. In this way it is possible to perform the accepting process with high accuracy.

In the above description the accepting unit selects the delivery target users forming the delivery target user group from the non allocated users in the future log table. However the accepting unit may select the delivery target users forming the delivery target user group from all of the delivery target users in the future log table. Here all of the delivery target users are delivery target users including both the allocated users and the non allocated users. When the number of non allocated users is 2000 and the number of allocated users is 8000 the number of all delivery target users is 10000 .

In this case the accepting unit processes the accepted order requests and a new advertisement delivery order request from the advertiser terminal as one order request. For example it is assumed that the accepted order requests are order requests with advertisement IDs A to A illustrated in . In addition it is assumed that in a new order request the designated user attributes is vehicle and the designated number of postings is 1000 .

The accepting unit determines a delivery target user group in which the number of delivery target users with the user attribute vehicle is equal to or greater than 1000 a delivery target user group in which the number of delivery target users with the user attribute vehicle travel is equal to or greater than 2000 and a delivery target user group in which the number of delivery target users with the user attribute male twenties is equal to or greater than 1500 as the delivery target user groups which satisfy the delivery conditions designated by the order request.

Whenever the accepting unit accepts an advertisement delivery order request the allocation unit allocates the delivery target user to the order request. The allocation process determines an allocation score corresponding to the allocation state of the delivery target user set in the future log table in response to the order request and minimizes a reduction in the allocation score before and after the allocation of the delivery target user in response to a new advertisement delivery order request. The allocation unit uses the combined user attribute as one user attribute similarly to the accepting unit .

First the allocation score will be described. The allocation unit counts the total number of user attributes of the non allocated users among a plurality of delivery target users set in the future log table illustrated in . The non allocated user is a delivery target user for which 0 is set to the allocation state in the future log table.

The total number of user attributes is the sum of the number of user attributes of the non allocated users. For example when the number of non allocated users is 1000 the sum of the number of user attributes of 1000 non allocated users is the total number of user attributes .

The number of user attributes is the number of delivery target users which are effectively set according to each classified user attribute. In the case of the psychographic attributes the attributes mean for example vehicle cosmetics clothes and travel . In the case of the demographic attributes the attributes mean for example sex and age .

In the case of the psychographic attributes the effectively set delivery target user is a delivery target user for which 1 is set to the corresponding attributes. In the case of the demographic attributes the effectively set delivery target user is a delivery target user for which information is set to the attributes.

For example it is assumed that the psychographic attributes are classified into only four attributes such as vehicle cosmetics clothes and travel and the demographic attributes are classified into only two attributes such as sex and age . In this case the maximum value of the number of user attributes is 6 .

In the example illustrated in the delivery target users who are not allocated to the order request are delivery target users with delivery target IDs F F F and F . In this case as illustrated in the numbers of user attributes of the delivery target users corresponding to the delivery target IDs F F F and F are 4 2 3 and 6 respectively. Therefore as illustrated in the total number of user attributes which is the sum of the number of user attributes of the delivery target users who are not allocated to the order request is 15 4 2 3 6 and the allocation score is 15 .

The allocation unit may use the total number of user attributes included only in the psychographic attributes as the allocation score. In addition the allocation unit may use the total number of user attributes included only in the demographic attributes as the allocation score. The allocation unit may use the total number of user attributes included only in a portion of the psychographic attributes or the demographic attributes as the allocation score.

In addition the total number of user attributes may not be used as the allocation score but other indexes may be used as the allocation score. For example the allocation unit may use the minimum number or ratio of non allocated users with the user attributes as the allocation score.

Next the allocation of the delivery target users in response to a new advertisement delivery order request will be described. The allocation unit selects the non allocated users who have the user attributes designated by a new advertisement delivery order request and correspond to the number of postings designated by the order request from the future log table and determines a reduction in the allocation score before and after the selected non allocated users are allocated to the order request.

There are a plurality of combinations of the non allocated users corresponding to the number of postings which is designated by the order request except in the case in which only the number of non allocated users with the user attributes designated by the advertisement delivery order request which corresponds to the number of postings designated by the order request is set in the future log table. For example when the number of non allocated users with the user attributes designated by the advertisement delivery order request is 10 and the number of non allocated users corresponding to the number of postings designated by the order request is 5 the number of combinations of the non allocated users is 252 .

The allocation unit determines combinations of the non allocated users where a reduction in the allocation score is the minimum before and after all combinations of the non allocated users corresponding to the number of postings designated by the order request are allocated to the order request. Then the allocation unit selects combinations of the non allocated users which are determined to have the minimum reduction in the allocation score and allocates the selected combinations to the order request.

In addition the allocation unit may select one of the delivery target user groups which are determined to satisfy the delivery conditions by the accepting unit and perform an allocation process such that a reduction in the allocation score is the minimum before and after the delivery target users are allocated to the order request among the non allocated users forming the selected delivery target user group. In this case it is possible to reduce the number of combinations of the non allocated users used to determine the allocation score in the allocation process and reduce the processing load of the allocation unit .

In this case for example the allocation unit can allocate to the order request a delivery target user group with the largest number of user attributes designated by the order request among the delivery target user groups which are determined to satisfy the delivery conditions by the accepting unit . In this way it is possible to appropriately allocate the delivery target user while reducing the processing load of the allocation unit .

Next the procedure of an advertisement delivery management process of the advertisement delivery management apparatus according to an embodiment will be described. is a diagram illustrating an example of the flow of the advertisement delivery management process of the advertisement delivery management apparatus according to the embodiment. The flow of the advertisement delivery management process starts when an advertisement delivery order request is transmitted by the advertiser terminal .

When the communication unit receives the advertisement delivery order request from the advertiser terminal the control unit of the advertisement delivery management apparatus performs a process of acquiring the delivery target user group as illustrated in Step S . In the process the control unit repeatedly performs a process of selecting the delivery target user from the future log table stored in the future log DB according to a predetermined rule to acquire information on two or more types of delivery target user groups.

Then the control unit performs a delivery condition satisfaction process Step S . In the process the control unit determines whether two or more types of delivery target user groups each satisfy the delivery conditions designated by the advertisement delivery order request.

Then the control unit determines whether the advertisement delivery order request can be accepted Step S . In the process the control unit determines that the advertisement delivery order request can be accepted when the ratio of the delivery target user groups satisfying the delivery conditions to the two or more types of delivery target user groups acquired in Step S is equal to or greater than a predetermined value.

When it is determined that the advertisement delivery order request can be accepted Step S Yes the control unit sets information included in the order request to the advertising information table to update the advertising information table Step S . Examples of the information included in the order request include user attributes an posting period the number of postings and advertising information. These information items are set in the advertising information table.

Then the control unit performs a process of allocating the delivery target user Step S . The non allocated user with the user attribute designated by the order request is allocated to the order request by the allocation process.

Then the control unit updates the future log table on the basis of the result of the allocation process in Step S Step S . Specifically the control unit updates the non allocated user who is allocated to the order request among the non allocated users set in the future log table to the allocated user. The allocation state is changed from 0 to 1 to update the non allocated user to the allocated user.

Then the control unit transmits a response to the reception of the order to the advertiser terminal through the communication unit Step S and ends the advertisement delivery management process. On the other hand when it is determined in Step S that the order request cannot be accepted from the advertiser terminal Step S No the control unit transmits an order rejection response to the advertiser terminal through the communication unit Step S and ends the advertisement delivery management process.

In the above described embodiment the accepting unit accepts the advertisement delivery order request when the ratio of the delivery target user groups which are determined to satisfy the delivery conditions by the determination unit to two or more types of delivery target user groups is equal to or greater than a predetermined value. However the embodiment is not limited to the above mentioned reception determination process. For example the accepting unit may accept the advertisement delivery order request on the basis of the satisfaction rate of each delivery target user group for the delivery conditions.

For example it is assumed that the numbers of delivery target users with the user attribute vehicle in the first to third delivery target user groups are 2000 1400 and 1000 respectively and the delivery conditions are that the number of times the user attribute vehicle is delivered is 1500 .

In this case the satisfaction rate of the first delivery target user group for the delivery conditions is 1.25 2000 1500 the satisfaction rate of the second delivery target user group for the delivery conditions is 0.93 1400 1500 and the satisfaction rate of the third delivery target user group for the delivery conditions is 0.67 1000 1500 .

Therefore the average of the satisfaction rates of the first to third delivery target user groups for the delivery conditions is 0.95. When the average of the satisfaction rates is equal to or greater than a predetermined value R for example 0.9 the accepting unit can determine to accept the advertisement delivery order request.

When the ratio of the delivery target user groups satisfying the delivery conditions to two or more types of delivery target user groups is in a predetermined range for example 0.8 to 0.9 the accepting unit may determine the average of the satisfaction rates of the delivery target user groups for the delivery conditions. In this case when the average of the satisfaction rates is the predetermined value R the accepting unit can determine to accept the advertisement delivery order request.

In the above description the predetermined ratio R or the predetermined value R can be changed depending on the settings of the advertisement delivery management apparatus by the administrator or the number of non allocated users in the future log table. However the predetermined ratio R or the predetermined value R may be changed depending on other factors. For example the predetermined ratio R or the predetermined value R may be changed on the basis of the coincidence hereinafter referred to as the coincidence of prediction between the future log predicted by the future log prediction unit and the user attributes of the user to which advertising information is actually delivered.

For example when the coincidence of prediction is low the predetermined ratio R or the predetermined value R is reduced. When the coincidence of prediction is high the predetermined ratio R or the predetermined value R is increased. In this way it is possible to accept the order request with high accuracy.

In the advertisement delivery management apparatus according to the embodiment the accepting unit corresponding to an example of an acquisition unit acquires information on two or more types of delivery target user groups each including a plurality of delivery target users predicted as the future advertisement delivery destinations and the accepting unit corresponding to an example of a determination unit determines whether each of the two or more types of delivery target user groups satisfies the delivery conditions designated by the advertisement delivery order request. Then the accepting unit corresponding to an example of an accepting unit accepts the advertisement delivery order request on the basis of the determination result.

According to this structure the process of determining whether the advertisement delivery conditions are satisfied can be performed for a plurality of prediction patterns. Therefore it is possible to improve the reception accuracy of an order request as compared to a case in which the determination process is performed for one prediction pattern. As a result it is possible to prevent loss of sales opportunities and prevent the reception of an order request which is not capable of being actually accepted.

The accepting unit accepts the advertisement delivery order request when the ratio of the delivery target user groups satisfying the delivery conditions to the two or more types of delivery target user groups is equal to or greater than a predetermined value.

According to this structure it is possible to further improve the reception accuracy of an order request. That is as the number of delivery target user groups increases the ratio of the delivery target user groups satisfying the delivery conditions designated by the order request is reduced. As a result there is a concern that the reception accuracy of the order request will be reduced. However it is possible to improve the reception accuracy of the order request by adjusting the predetermined value.

The future log prediction unit corresponding to an example of a prediction unit predicts a plurality of delivery target users as the future advertisement delivery destinations and the accepting unit repeatedly performs a process of selecting a predetermined ratio of the delivery target users to the plurality of delivery target users according to a predetermined rule to acquire information on the two or more types of delivery target user groups.

According to this structure it is possible to easily acquire different prediction patterns. Since these prediction patterns are acquired from one prediction pattern predicted by the future log prediction unit they can be associated with the delivery tendency of the user attributes. When the prediction accuracy of the future log prediction unit is high it is possible to Improve the reception accuracy of the order request.

The predetermined rule according to which the accepting unit selects the delivery target user is a rule that randomly selects a predetermined number of delivery target users from a plurality of delivery target users.

In addition a plurality of future log prediction units corresponding to an example of a prediction unit predict a plurality of delivery target users as the future advertisement delivery destinations according to different rules and the accepting unit acquires information on the plurality of delivery target users predicted by the plurality of future log prediction units as information on the two or more types of delivery target user groups.

According to this structure even when the prediction accuracy of each future log prediction unit is low it is possible to accept an order request with high accuracy.

The order request delivery conditions include information for designating one or more user attributes and information on the number of deliveries. The accepting unit determines that the delivery target user group satisfies the delivery conditions when the number of delivery target users with the user attribute designated by the delivery conditions among a plurality of delivery target users in the delivery target user group is equal to or greater than the number of deliveries designated by the delivery conditions.

According to this structure it is possible to accurately determine whether the delivery conditions are satisfied considering the user attributes or the number of deliveries designated by the order request.

The accepting unit determines the number of delivery target users using a combination of two or more user attributes whose frequency is designated by the advertisement delivery order request and is equal to or greater than a threshold value as one user attribute.

According to this structure it is possible to count the number of delivery target users using a combination of two or more user attributes whose frequency is designated by the order request and is equal to or greater than a threshold value as one user attribute. Therefore it is possible to increase the possibility of the future advertisement delivery order being accepted and prevent loss of sales opportunities.

The advertisement delivery management apparatus may be implemented by a plurality of server computers. In addition the structure of the advertisement delivery management apparatus may be flexibly changed depending on the functions. For example an external platform may be called by an application programming interface API or network computing and then executed to implement the advertisement delivery management apparatus . The advertisement delivery management apparatus and the information delivery apparatus may be implemented by one server computer.

According to the embodiment it is possible to provide an advertisement delivery management apparatus and an advertisement delivery management method which can perform a process of accepting an advertisement delivery order with high accuracy.

Although the invention has been described with respect to specific embodiments for a complete and clear disclosure the appended claims are not to be thus limited but are to be construed as embodying all modifications and alternative constructions that may occur to one skilled in the art that fairly fall within the basic teaching herein set forth.
