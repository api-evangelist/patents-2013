title: Agile acquisition of location services in a device
abstract: Aspects of the disclosure permit agile acquisition of a location service in a device. In one aspect of such acquisition, the device can rely on location signals available globally in order to determine a region associated with the device, and in response to determination of the region, the device can acquire service information representative or otherwise indicative of the location service based at least on the region. In another aspect, the device can be configured to consume the location service. The agility of such acquisition can stem from the absence of (i) scanning for location services associated with the area in which the device is present and/or (ii) a predefined pool of location services established in production of the device.

Conventional acquisition of location services in a location device generally include scanning for pre established location service sources e.g. sources of location signals such as timing messages or similar pilot or information signals associated with a geographical area in which the location device is present. Such sources and or a related pool of location services typically are established in production of the device. Further procedures and associated information that permit such a scanning generally are implemented during production of the device. Accordingly such conventional acquisition typically results in highly complex production protocols especially as location based services become more ubiquitous and demand thereof increases.

The disclosure recognizes and addresses in one aspect the issue of acquisition of location services in a location device where the location services that may be acquired are established during production of the communication device. More specifically yet not exclusively the disclosure provides devices systems techniques and or computer program products that can permit agile acquisition of location service s in a computing device. As described in greater detail below the computing device can rely on location signals available globally in order to determine a region in which the device is present. In response to the determination of the region the device can acquire service information representative or otherwise indicative of the location service s based at least on the region. Availability of such service information permits configuration of the device to consume at least one of the location service s . It can be appreciated that in one aspect the agility of such acquisition can stem from the absence of i scanning for pre established location services associated with the region in which the device is present and or ii a predefined pool of location services established in production of the device. In another aspect the agility of the acquisition can stem from the identification of available location service s in such a region prior to configuration of device for consumption of a specific location service that may be available without reliance on pre established location services associated with the device.

Embodiments of the disclosure provide various advantages over conventional technologies for acquisition of location service in a multi mode location device. One example advantage may include improved performance e.g. lesser search time and lesser power consumption associated with identifying the available services of computing devices that utilize or otherwise consume location services and ensuing improved end user experience or perceived quality of service. Another example advantage may include cost reduction via reduction of production cycle s and or chipset size s . In particular yet not exclusively device complexity can be reducing or otherwise containing availability of superfluous functionality in a device with the ensuing reduction in the amount of stock keeping units SKUs and special configuration of the device. Yet another advantage may include increased reliability of computing devices e.g. location devices that consume location services e.g. navigation services from a plurality of sources. Still another example may include the implementation of slim system design where network infrastructure can be reused between location service systems in instances in which functional elements or parts of the subsystem are not available or need not be used.
