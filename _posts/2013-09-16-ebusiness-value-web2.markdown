title: E-business value web
abstract: A method and system is provided to manage and track changes in enterprise architectures. The invention provides a hierarchical visual management tool to manage and update relational information within an enterprise in a controlled fashion. The relationship may be maintained in a database and displayed via graphical user interface. Enterprise assets are categorized into such categories as goals, customer values or requirements, capabilities, resources, and the like. A hierarchy is constructed so that relationships between these various categories are identified and captured using the invention. Weights may be assigned to each element of the categories so that any proposed change to an enterprise architecture may be viewed so that a value can be ascertained and compared between other values of other proposed changes. In this manner, tracking and management of evolutionary changes to an architecture may be accomplished using relational information.

This invention was made with government support under the terms of contract number TCS0994 awarded by the Department of Defense. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The invention generally relates to an enterprise management support system and more particularly to a decision making system to evaluate enterprise decisions.

In the decision making process for evolutionary changes and modifications to an enterprise few tools and automation capabilities exist to quantify the enterprise elements including software and hardware system functionality business processes and workforce capabilities of evolutionary changes. The ability to identify and monitor these elements provides an organization an overview of their total capabilities and supporting resources in effect it defines an organization s business model. Through the linkage of the business model to the organization s vision mission and goals an organization can draw a strategic linkage from what they are chartered to do right down to the people process and technology resources that they need to have to complete their mission.

Currently if an organization would like to determine whether a strategic return on investment resides in a selected solution alternative information from a number of sources would have to be gathered accuracy determined and then a cost benefit analysis performed. There is currently no known application that can align and track capabilities and resources across an entire organization in this fashion.

This invention is directed to an e Business Value Web eBVW . Generally the invention provides a hierarchical visual management tool to manage and update relational information within an enterprise in a controlled fashion. The relationship of the information is maintained in a database as additions and modifications are made so that the hierarchical relationship is accurately maintained at each level. The relational information may be used to manage and evaluate an evolutionary change to the enterprise. The evolutionary change may include any change in enterprise operation or an enterprise architecture and may include one or more of its products.

The invention includes a web application management tool that provides for illustrating and quantifying the value of transforming an enterprise business model from its current as is state to a proposed to be business model. Or said differently from one state to another state. Alternative transformation quantifications i.e. alternative to be models may be projected for comparison. The invention provides a stable business model that identifies with text and graphics via a front end GUI the value of one or more proposed solutions the capabilities the transformed to be enterprise will deliver and the resources to support those capabilities.

The eBVW acts as a robust management and decision support system that provides a view of transformation potential. This application tracks the alignment of the current operational environment with alternatives that provide the best value for the customer organization and customer base. The eBVW may present a solution to integrating the people process and technology resources of the organization with the current and future business strategies.

The invention further provides a decision making tool to help an organization focus its efforts on issues that will directly affect the completion of its mission via a streamlined process by capturing and displaying all of the current resources that an organization has and how they relate to the organization s mission in a near real time fashion. The eBVW maintains the relationships between an organization s value to its customers the capabilities the organization has to support its values and the resources that provide those capabilities. In this manner an organization can directly track which resources e.g. people process or technology directly support specific capabilities to provide the customer with a unique value.

The hierarchical relational components of the value tree illustrated in includes a depiction of one Goal N and associated hierarchical information e.g. Value Element Strategic Capability Resources etc. . It should be understood that the Goal and associated information is one illustrative example implementing the invention and that any number of Goals and associated hierarchical information may be provided by the invention. For each Goal N one or more lower layers of the hierarchy may be present as necessary. The Value Web tree of includes the following for illustration 

The Mission not shown of the organization is the definition of what the organization is striving for currently. Both the vision and the mission are defined and validated through traditional methods of strategic planning within the organization. An example of a mission is To provide direct support for our customers in their business processes.

A Goal includes the Corporate Directive derived from either a Mission statement or a Strategic Plan and generally provides and establishes a final end point of an enterprise change. They tend to be a further decomposition of the mission of the organization. There may be any number of Goals 1 to N constructed. An example of a Goal is Our workforce will consist of the premier e Business consultants in the industry.

The Customer Values Value represents the requirements wants and needs that the enterprise will bring to the stakeholders. A Customer Value is typically identified by an enterprise customer or by the enterprise itself. A Goal may have any number of Value elements 1 to N defined or identified and associated with the Goal. Here there may be a many to many relationship between the Customer Values and the Goals. In other words there are many Customer Values per Goal and Customer Values could belong to multiple Goals. An example of a Customer Value is Provide time savings for procurement through web based transactions.

The Strategic Capabilities Capabilities or Capability enablers contained in the Value Web represent critical functions that the organization must be capable of doing well to insure the delivery of the ideal defined Customer Values targeted customer wants needs and fulfilling its own strategic Goals. A Customer Value may include or have affiliated any number of Strategic Capabilities 1 to N and have a many to many relationship with the Customer values. An example of a strategic capability is A web portal that provides one stop shopping for all of an organization s procurement.

The Operational Resources Resources document the physical components that must be present to enable the Capabilities to deliver the value expressed in the Value Elements . The Strategic Capabilities are supported by one or more Operational Resources and include categories of enterprise components for example business processes personnel skills competencies workforce skills physical entities information technology or system components and data knowledge or information. A Strategic Capability may include any number of Operational Resources 1 to N and likewise has a many to many relationship with the Strategic Capabilities . An example of an operational resource is A specific type of web server to run the internet portal.

The invention provides interfacing and insertion of other life cycle support information that may exist in an enterprise into the enterprise business model. These include the following as further depicted in .

The Value Web provides the physical and relational depiction of an organization s Business Model Vision . Traditionally a business model depicts the company s vision mission and goals and how it plans to operate in its market environment. It is often enough to provide guidance for analysis and alignment of any functional area of a company including for example information technology I T and to provide prioritization criteria for initiatives programs projects and even modules of a technology package. This is because good vision mission goal statements usually identify a future view a description of types of offerings and customers and the means to achieve the desired outcome.

In practice value propositions required capabilities and key resources to enable a capability are replacing the use of traditional strategic concepts of Critical Success Factors and Distinctive Competencies. With this in view the required capabilities goals and customer values from the Business Model are downloaded to the Value Web database and then accessed during the life cycle via the Value Web application.

The Goals are captured from the organization s Strategic plans which typically are detailed documented plans that describe the actions of an organization in a current or future period to achieve its business objectives and are defined in the Value Web database or linked to the database which can then be accessed via the Value Web application. If a new goal is added then appropriate Value Web Customer Values Capabilities and Resources must also be in place to support the new goal. If the new goal does not have the strategic eBVW elements supporting it then the application will prompt the user to identify the corresponding business processes workforce skills or technologies. The eBVW will also prompt the user to validate the realignment or deletion of the values capabilities and resources when a goal is removed.

The Requirements are defined as the customer s wants and needs which are tied directly to the Strategic Capabilities of the eBVW. These system process or product service requirements must be supported by at least one or more Strategic Capability . If a client formally gathers and maintains customer requests requirements in another automated system these requirements can be uploaded downloaded or entered into the eBVW database and then accessed during the life cycle via the eBVW application.

The Operational Model depicts the physical layout of the current as is and to be enterprise architecture. Each technology process or skill enabler can be traced back to a specific physical node or element which gives the organizational executives CEO CIO CFO the ability to track functionality and flag specific capabilities that might not have adequate support.

The Functional Model depicts the functions of the current and to be enterprise operations skills and architecture. Each Resource can be traced back to a specific functional element which then can be matched to specific requirements.

The Component Model depicts the functional components of the current and to be enterprise architecture. Each resource can be traced back to a specific component element which then can be matched to specific requirements.

The Business Processes are defined known methods and procedures in the enterprise for carrying out its strategic plans and operations. A complete inventory of the as is processes and to be processes are maintained in the application as Operational Resources . These are directly tied to a specific Strategic Capability or multiple Strategic Capabilities . Managers can view a Strategic Capability and then see which processes support it or what process changes are needed to support it. Process Measurements from external process modeling tools can be captured and linked to the eBVW database so that process performance can be accessed during the life cycle via the eBVW application. New processes may come into being through normal course of business operations and often impact future planning of the enterprise.

The Transition Plan is a defined overall approach in the organization to be taken to implement a new capability or enhancement. eBVW supports more complete and accurate planning for improvements or new capabilities because it clearly identifies all existing as is processes systems and skills that support a current capability and those required to achieve the future state. Transitioning and Implementation Plans define the overall approach that an organization will take to implement a new capability or enhance performance against an existing capability. Each Strategic Capability defined within a transition plan must also have a supporting capability on the eBVW.

Lifecycle Costing typically includes costs expenses for client labor consulting training hardware and infrastructure hardware maintenance software licensing software maintenance and post implementation components. Each cost element can be traced to one or more Strategic Capability of the eBVW. This enables Business Managers to project the high level summary of hard or quantifiable benefits such as total project benefits total project expenditures internal rate of return net present value and discounted payback period years . Lifecycle costs can be downloaded to the eBVW database and then accessed during the lifecycle via the eBVW application. Alternative decisions may be made base on the costing.

The Business Case documents and quantifies the benefits costs schedules and assumptions required to justify the implementation of the Transformation project recommendations. The eBVW plays a key role in the development of the Business Case by giving the designer a tool in which he she can access multiple key elements needed in creating the Business Case .

eBVW provides a management tool to support the decisions of corporate and mission operations and provides the ability to track the enterprise capabilities that are required to satisfy the customer s values in alignment with the organization s goals. However in order for the eBVW to provide flexible practical utility it is possible to assign weights to the eBVW s different components to assign a relative priority among the components. Through the weighting and prioritization of elements the capabilities of precedence can be assigned higher weights thus being given consideration before less value adding capabilities. Some of the eBVW capabilities support the following generally known business activities in a methodical manner 

Driving business case analysis and resolution value cost lost opportunity cost ROI etc. by defining the value contribution.

Facilitating comparison of the Transition Plan s deployment of capabilities vs. the delivery of the projected future capabilities.

Providing detailed information to support more robust Transition Planning when a new capability is implemented.

The eBVW serves as an integrating framework for defining and measuring how current and future capabilities directly support an organization s Vision and Mission. The process of implementing new and innovative capabilities implies that many various aspects of systems engineering often necessitates interaction. The eBVW lies in the middle of this process as a checkpoint to provide visibility whether the new to be capabilities will add value to the overall enterprise and to what degree such value is added. The process for incorporating a new capability into the operational environment is outlined and may include 

Identifying new capabilities from changes to goals business processes workforce skills or technology and drive requirement changes.

Inserting technology which provides resources to meeting capabilities or may create new capabilities.

Selecting capabilities for delivery based on optimum value to the Customer Values and allocated for development.

Measuring relative impact by eBVW to estimate value or benefit against the organizations Strategic objectives.

Testing may verify capabilities and requirements are satisfied and provide collected metrics for modeling and simulation.

By way of example the GUI of depicts the eBVW Home Page according to the invention that provides a convenient way to view the information contained and managed by the eVBW database hierarchy by providing a visual representation of the hierarchy and permitting traversal of the hierarchy. By way of example the GUI provides a user with point and click capability for Goals 1 N which has a definition field associated with each Goal button and various dynamic links to various other operational elements of the eBVW such as for example architecture artifacts DOORS i.e. a known systems requirement management tool transition plan lifecycle cost business case and business processes . These dynamic links may also link any of the life cycle support information e.g. items into the eBVW as necessary. In embodiments other dynamic links may be presented such as for example financial planning tools forecasting tools or the like. Also provided is a visual presentation of the associated Vision statement that provides an overall business purpose for the goal. An explanatory field is associated with the point and click buttons e.g. .

The eBVW Home page also provides for a Traceability Scale that shows the level of the eBVW currently being viewed within the eBVW hierarchy. The Tracebility Scale shows lineage of relationships of one eBVW element to others. The Traceability Scale permits the user to move up and down the hierarchy as desired by selecting the level they want to view for example by point and click for forward and backward functionality. A download capability provides for downloading data into other database formats for maintenance purposes and reports. The components of the Value Tree are manipulated by the invention via the GUI and supporting software logic and are maintained in logical hierarchical relationship in a database for updating and monitoring.

As can be seen by the exemplary Value Home Page of the invention provides a hierarchical visual management tool to manage and update relational information within an enterprise in a controlled fashion. The relationship of the information is maintained in a database as additions and modifications are made so that the hierarchical relationship is accurately maintained at each level. Updates to the hierarchy are stored to a eBVW database dynamically as changes are made. A project scheduling package may be employed to relate the elements of each level to an enterprise schedule for tracking and management purposes.

When adding a new Strategic Capability under control of the invention the Requirements may be updated to ensure that a contribution is identified for the added value when the new Strategic Capability is requested. The Strategic Capability eventually may be implemented e.g. designed and developed in proper fashion so that any Operational Resources used to provide the Strategic Capability are included with value in mind as tracked and managed by the invention. Following design and development stages under the umbrella controls of the invention integration and testing may be conducted under a prototype environment for example in order to gauge the value the capability might contribute towards the Customer Vision through predicted metrics.

The eBVW may then be utilized to transition the Strategic Capability into actual operations. The metrics provided by the invention enables real insight to the value that the new Strategic Capability may bring to the enterprise when it is fully functional in an operational environment.

The eBVW may also be incorporated into the Operations and Maintenance O M processes to ensure the Strategic Capability may be sustainable well into the future. Hence the invention supplies comprehensive lifecycle management support by integrating multiple facets of components of the lifecycle into a unified cost value benefit management tool.

The process and steps shown in may provide for a service for managing and planning an evolutionary change to an enterprise. This may include any portion of a product or service such as for example hardware or software system or corresponding architecture and components thereof. Costs and resources can be projected to weigh alternatives or to evaluate one value requirement over another in order to make decisions and choices based on contributing factors such as for example implementation costs a revenue increase or cost saving.

There are four alternative starting points in the flow of and . These entry points permit managing various enterprise assets such as for example a new customer value new technology new workforce skills or new process. Beginning with starting point at step there is a perceived need to provide a new value to stakeholders of an enterprise or operation. At step a new Customer Value is identified. At step a verification occurs to determine that the new Customer Value aligns with the enterprise goals. At step current Capabilities are evaluated to determine if current Capabilities are sufficient for supporting the new Customer Value. At step a decision is made whether the current Capabilities satisfy the Customer Value. If yes then at step the relationships between the Capabilities and Customer Value are defined. If no however at step new Capabilities are identified to support and satisfy the new Customer Value.

At step a check is made whether available Resources satisfy the new Capabilities. If yes then at step the relationships between Capabilities and Resources are defined. If no at step new Resources are identified to satisfy the newly identified Capability. At step the relationship is defined between Capabilities and the Resources. At step new measures and metrics are established for the Resources. Assignment of other weights may occur as well particularly if step is not performed. At step the Resources contributions to the Capability are each weighed or evaluated. At step measures are established for all elements including the Resources if necessary if not previously established in step . At step weights are established for all elements compared to parent elements. This may be an assignment of a numeric value to each element within the eBVW hierarchy. The weights may be maintained by the eBVW software in the eBVW database. At step Capabilities are evaluated based on the weights and if the priorities are deemed correct proceeds with step otherwise at step a prioritization occurs of the Capabilities.

At step a tradeoff analysis may be conducted to determine Capability implementation phases. For example costs time factors benefits etc. associated with each element are examined and tradeoff decisions made. At step an implementation schedule may be developed to forecast the timing and decisions of the tradeoff analysis. At step a business case analysis on implementation phases may be conducted. This provides priorities of the tradeoff analysis and determines which phases are implemented in what order etc. A business case analysis may compare alternatives at different levels of focus including the total cost factors for portions or an entire proposed evolutionary change. At step a decision is made to approve the business case. If not then a re prioritization is undertaken at step . If yes then at step an outcome based performance metrics is assigned. At step the capabilities and resources are implemented and tracked based on metrics such as for example costs and time or other established targeted goals. At step the Capabilities and Resources are tracked based on the metrics. At step effectiveness to the enterprise stakeholders is evaluated as necessary to assure compliance and awareness and to assure that the needs and expectations have met with the decisions of the business case analysis and implementation results. At step the process may be repeated as necessary to continually manage and oversee an enterprise operation.

Alternate entry at provides for the recognition of new technology. At step new technology is made available or recognized as potentially available. The process continues at step above. Alternate entry at step deals with new workforce skills. At step new workforce skills are developed acquired or recognized. The process continues with step . Alternate entry at step deals with new processes. At step new processes are developed acquired or recognized. The process then continues with step .

At step a value is determined as provided by the at least one capability based on implementation cost and revenue increase or cost saving. The value is typically denoted in monetary terms but may be in terms of strategic business worth or the like. At step the value provided by the capability is compared to a value provided by at least one other capability and an optimum value is determined. At step at least one of a business process personnel skill competency physical entity information technology system component and infrastructure component is identified as a strategic resource. At step at least one strategic resource is identified to support the at least one capability.

At step weights are assigned to the strategic resources or capabilities and prioritized based on such weights. At step outcome based performance metrics are assigned to strategic resources or capabilities. At step one or more strategic resources or capabilities are implemented and are tracked based on performance metrics. Performance metrics may be defined and tested through several manners including for example conducting facilitated working sessions or by building simulation models for business Process or Technology Resource Enablers. Estimates may be entered and recorded and subsequently modified as additional real performance information is observed. The process exits.

At step a review is performed to ensure that one or more values align with the at least one goal. At step relationships between the values and capabilities are defined. At step relationships between the capabilities and resources are defined. At step strategic capabilities affiliate and identify a new workforce capability or new technology capability with the one or more values. At step resources identify and affiliate process personnel skills competencies information technology system component or infrastructure component.

At step a database is maintained reflecting the hierarchical relationship of the goal s value s strategic capabilities and resource s as needed. At step cost factors are determined for alternative evolutionary changes by choosing and comparing various sets of Goals Values Capabilities and or Resources and weighing the benefits. At step cost factors are compared for more than one alternative evolutionary change. At step the hierarchical relationships i.e. goal value strategic capability resource etc. are maintained in a database and the hierarchy is viewable and modifiable via a GUI.

As thus discussed the eBVW provides a comprehensive tool for managing enterprise operations for evolutionary or revolutionary i.e. incremental or transformational change decisions. The enterprise or portions thereof may be represented in a hierarchical fashion by defining the elements involved in the processes capabilities and resources of the enterprise. Projecting the effects of an evolutionary change may be accomplished by analyzing alternative choices for optimal benefits.

While the invention has been described in terms of embodiments those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modifications and in the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
