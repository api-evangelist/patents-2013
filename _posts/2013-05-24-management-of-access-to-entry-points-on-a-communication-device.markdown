The present invention relates to the management of communication services provisioned on a mobile communication device.

Communication devices such as smart phones personal digital assistants PDAs personal computers tablet computers and the like may be used to communicate electronically using one or more messaging services such as e mail voice communication instant messages IM short message service SMS multimedia messaging service MMS voicemail visual voice mail VVM and others. Communication devices may also be used to receive data from feeds or push services for example from enterprise services news sources and social network services and to transmit data to such services for publication or distribution. Users of mobile communication devices may obtain access to such services by provisioning an appropriate associated service for the mobile communication device. The service on the communication device connects to the primary service offered over a public or wireless network such as an e mail service so that the user may access the primary service using the associated service. Communications such as e mail messages IM SMS MMS voicemail VVM and the like received at the mobile communication device from the primary service may be stored in one or more data stores at the device and may be accessible to the user via a messaging application which can retrieve communications from one or more data stores and provide user access to communications in a unified mailbox.

In another aspect there is also provided a computer program product comprising a computer readable medium which may include a non transitory storage medium storing computer executable instructions which when executed on one or more processors of a communication device cause the system to carry out all or part of the methods of the embodiments described herein.

The embodiments described herein may be implemented on a communication device such as that illustrated in . The communication device may communicate with other devices over a wireless communication system or enterprise system as illustrated in . The communication device may be a mobile device with two way communication and advanced data communication capabilities including the capability to communicate with other mobile devices or computer systems through a network of transceiver stations. The communication device can also have voice communication capabilities.

The communication subsystem receives messages from and sends messages to a wireless network . In this exemplary embodiment of the communication device the communication subsystem is configured in accordance with one or more of Global System for Mobile Communication GSM General Packet Radio Services GPRS standards Enhanced Data GSM Environment EDGE and Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service UMTS . New standards are still being defined but it is believed that they will have similarities to the network behavior described herein and it will also be understood by persons skilled in the art that the embodiments described herein are intended to use any other suitable standards that are developed in the future. The wireless link connecting the communication subsystem with the wireless network represents one or more different Radio Frequency RF channels operating according to defined protocols specified for GSM GPRS EDGE or UMTS and optionally other network communications. With newer network protocols these channels are capable of supporting both circuit switched voice communications and packet switched data communications.

Other wireless networks can also be associated with the communication device in variant implementations. The different types of wireless networks that can be employed include for example data centric wireless networks voice centric wireless networks and dual mode networks that can support both voice and data communications over the same physical base stations. Combined dual mode networks include but are not limited to Code Division Multiple Access CDMA or CDMA2000 networks GSM GPRS networks third generation 3G networks like EDGE HSPA HSPA EVDO and UMTS or fourth generation 4G networks such as LTE and LTE Advanced. Some other examples of data centric networks include WiFi 802.11 Mobitex and DataTAC network communication systems. Examples of other voice centric data networks include Personal Communication Systems PCS networks like GSM and Time Division Multiple Access TDMA systems. The mobile device may be provided with additional communication subsystems such as the wireless LAN WLAN communication subsystem also shown in . The WLAN communication subsystem may operate in accordance with a known network protocol such as one or more of the 802.11 family of standards developed by IEEE. The communication subsystem may be separate from or integrated with the communication subsystem or with the short range communications module . The main processor also interacts with additional subsystems such as a Random Access Memory RAM a flash memory a display an auxiliary input output I O subsystem a data port a keyboard a speaker a microphone the short range communications and other device subsystems .

Some of the subsystems of the communication device perform communication related functions whereas other subsystems can provide resident or on device functions. By way of example the display and the keyboard can be used for both communication related functions such as entering a text message for transmission over the network and device resident functions such as a calculator or task list.

A rendering circuit is included in the device . When a user specifies that a data file is to be viewed on the display the rendering circuit analyzes and processes the data file for visualization on the display . Rendering data files originally optimized or prepared for visualization on large screen displays on a portable electronic device display often requires additional processing prior to visualization on the small screen portable electronic device displays. This additional processing may be accomplished by the rendering engine . As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art the rendering engine can be implemented in hardware software or a combination thereof and can comprise a dedicated image processor and associated circuitry or can be implemented within main processor .

The communication device can send and receive communication signals over the wireless network after required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Network access is associated with a subscriber or user of the communication device . To identify a subscriber the communication device requires a SIM RUIM card i.e. Subscriber Identity Module or a Removable User Identity Module to be inserted into a SIM RUIM interface in order to communicate with a network. The SIM RUIM card is one type of a conventional smart card that can be used to identify a subscriber of the communication device and to personalize the communication device among other things. Without the SIM RUIM card the communication device is not fully operational for communication with the wireless network . By inserting the SIM RUIM card into the SIM RUIM interface a subscriber can access all subscribed services. Services can include web browsing and messaging such as e mail voice mail Short Message Service SMS and Multimedia Messaging Services MMS . More advanced services can include point of sale field service and sales force automation. The SIM RUIM card includes a processor and memory for storing information. Once the SIM RUIM card is inserted into the SIM RUIM interface it is coupled to the main processor . In order to identify the subscriber the SIM RUIM card can include some user parameters such as an International Mobile Subscriber Identity IMSI . An advantage of using the SIM RUIM card is that a subscriber is not necessarily bound by any single physical mobile device. The SIM RUIM card can store additional subscriber information for a mobile device as well including datebook or calendar information and recent call information. Alternatively user identification information can also be programmed into the flash memory .

The communication device may be a battery powered device including a battery interface for receiving one or more rechargeable batteries . In at least some embodiments the battery can be a smart battery with an embedded microprocessor. The battery interface is coupled to a regulator not shown which assists the battery in providing power V to the communication device . Although current technology makes use of a battery future technologies such as micro fuel cells can provide the power to the communication device .

The communication device also includes an operating system and software components to which are described in more detail below. The operating system and the software components to that are executed by the main processor are typically stored in a persistent store such as the flash memory which can alternatively be a read only memory ROM or similar storage element not shown . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that portions of the operating system and the software components to such as specific device applications or parts thereof can be temporarily loaded into a volatile store such as the RAM . Other software components can also be included as is well known to those skilled in the art.

The subset of software applications that control basic device operations including data and voice communication applications will normally be installed on the communication device during its manufacture. Other software applications include a message application that can be any suitable software program that allows a user of the communication device to send and receive electronic messages. Various alternatives exist for the message application as is well known to those skilled in the art. Messages that have been sent or received by the user are typically stored in the flash memory of the communication device or some other suitable storage element in the communication device . In at least some embodiments some of the sent and received messages can be stored remotely from the device such as in a data store of an associated host system that the communication device communicates with.

The software applications can further include a device state module a Personal Information Manager PIM and other suitable modules not shown . The device state module provides persistence i.e. the device state module ensures that important device data is stored in persistent memory such as the flash memory so that the data is not lost when the communication device is turned off or loses power.

The PIM includes functionality for organizing and managing data items of interest to the user such as but not limited to e mail contacts calendar events voice mails appointments and task items. A PIM application has the ability to send and receive data items via the wireless network . PIM data items can be seamlessly integrated synchronized and updated via the wireless network with the mobile device subscriber s corresponding data items stored and or associated with a host computer system. This functionality creates a mirrored host computer on the communication device with respect to such items. This can be particularly advantageous when the host computer system is the mobile device subscriber s office computer system.

The communication device also includes a connect module and an information technology IT policy module . The connect module implements the communication protocols that are required for the communication device to communicate with the wireless infrastructure and any host system such as an enterprise system that the communication device is authorized to interface with. Examples of a wireless infrastructure and an enterprise system are given in which are described in more detail below.

The connect module includes a set of Application Programming Interfaces APIs that can be integrated with the communication device to allow the communication device to use any number of services associated with the enterprise system or with other systems accessible over the network . The connect module allows the communication device to establish an end to end secure authenticated communication pipe with the host system. A subset of applications for which access is provided by the connect module can be used to pass IT policy commands from the host system to the communication device . This can be done in a wireless or wired manner. These instructions can then be passed to the IT policy module to modify the configuration of the device . Alternatively in some cases the IT policy update can also be done over a wired connection.

Other types of software applications can also be installed on the communication device . These software applications can be third party applications which are added after the manufacture of the communication device . Examples of third party applications include games calculators utilities etc.

The additional applications can be loaded onto the communication device through at least one of the wireless network the auxiliary I O subsystem the data port the short range communications subsystem or any other suitable device subsystem . This flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the communication device and can provide enhanced on device functions communication related functions or both. For example secure communication applications can enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the communication device .

The data port enables a subscriber to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the communication device by providing for information or software downloads to the communication device other than through a wireless communication network. The alternate download path can for example be used to load an encryption key onto the communication device through a direct and thus reliable and trusted connection to provide secure device communication. The data port can be any suitable port that enables data communication between the communication device and another computing device. The data port can be a serial or a parallel port. In some instances the data port can be a USB port that includes data lines for data transfer and a supply line that can provide a charging current to charge the battery of the communication device .

The short range communications subsystem provides for communication between the communication device and different systems or devices without the use of the wireless network . For example the subsystem can include an infrared device and associated circuits and components for short range communication. Examples of short range communication standards include standards developed by the Infrared Data Association IrDA Bluetooth and the 802.11 family of standards developed by IEEE including Wi Fi and Wi Fi Direct.

In use a received signal such as a text message an e mail message or web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem and input to the main processor . The main processor will then process the received signal for output to the display or alternatively to the auxiliary I O subsystem . A subscriber can also compose data items such as e mail messages for example using the keyboard in conjunction with the display and possibly the auxiliary I O subsystem . The auxiliary subsystem can include devices such as a touchscreen mouse track ball infrared fingerprint detector or a roller wheel with dynamic button pressing capability. The keyboard is preferably an alphanumeric keyboard and or telephone type keypad. However other types of keyboards can also be used. A composed item can be transmitted over the wireless network through the communication subsystem . It will be appreciated that if the display comprises a touchscreen then the auxiliary subsystem may still comprise one or more of the devices identified above.

For voice communications the overall operation of the communication device is substantially similar except that the received signals are output to the speaker and signals for transmission are generated by the microphone . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem can also be implemented on the communication device . Although voice or audio signal output is accomplished primarily through the speaker the display can also be used to provide additional information such as the identity of a calling party duration of a voice call or other voice call related information.

Signals received by the antenna through the wireless network are input to the receiver which can perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification frequency down conversion filtering channel selection and analog to digital A D conversion. A D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner signals to be transmitted are processed including modulation and encoding by the DSP . These DSP processed signals are input to the transmitter for digital to analog D A conversion frequency up conversion filtering amplification and transmission over the wireless network via the antenna . The DSP not only processes communication signals but also provides for receiver and transmitter control. For example the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver and the transmitter can be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .

The wireless link between the communication device and the wireless network can contain one or more different channels typically different RF channels and associated protocols used between the communication device and the wireless network . An RF channel is a limited resource that should be conserved typically due to limits in overall bandwidth and limited battery power of the communication device . When the communication device is fully operational the transmitter is typically keyed or turned on only when it is transmitting to the wireless network and is otherwise turned off to conserve resources. Similarly the receiver is periodically turned off to conserve power until it is needed to receive signals or information if at all during designated time periods.

In a GSM network the MSC is coupled to the BSC and to a landline network such as a Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN to satisfy circuit switched requirements. The connection through the PCU the SGSN and the GGSN to a public or private network Internet also referred to herein generally as a shared network infrastructure represents the data path for GPRS capable mobile devices. In a GSM network extended with GPRS capabilities the BSC also contains the Packet Control Unit PCU that connects to the SGSN to control segmentation radio channel allocation and to satisfy packet switched requirements. To track the location of the communication device and availability for both circuit switched and packet switched management the HLR is shared between the MSC and the SGSN . Access to the VLR is controlled by the MSC .

The station is a fixed transceiver station and together with the BSC form fixed transceiver equipment. The fixed transceiver equipment provides wireless network coverage for a particular coverage area commonly referred to as a cell . The fixed transceiver equipment transmits communication signals to and receives communication signals from mobile devices within its cell via the station . The fixed transceiver equipment normally performs such functions as modulation and possibly encoding and or encryption of signals to be transmitted to the communication device in accordance with particular usually predetermined communication protocols and parameters under control of its controller. The fixed transceiver equipment similarly demodulates and possibly decodes and decrypts if necessary any communication signals received from the communication device within its cell. Communication protocols and parameters can vary between different nodes. For example one node can employ a different modulation scheme and operate at different frequencies than other nodes.

For all communication devices registered with a specific network permanent configuration data such as a user profile is stored in the HLR . The HLR also contains location information for each registered mobile device and can be queried to determine the current location of a mobile device. The MSC is responsible for a group of location areas and stores the data of the mobile devices currently in its area of responsibility in the VLR . Further the VLR also contains information on mobile devices that are visiting other networks. The information in the VLR includes part of the permanent mobile device data transmitted from the HLR to the VLR for faster access. By moving additional information from a remote HLR node to the VLR the amount of traffic between these nodes can be reduced so that voice and data services can be provided with faster response times and at the same time requiring less use of computing resources.

The SGSN and the GGSN are elements added for GPRS support namely packet switched data support within GSM. The SGSN and the MSC have similar responsibilities within the wireless network by keeping track of the location of each communication device . The SGSN also performs security functions and access control for data traffic on the wireless network . The GGSN provides internetworking connections with external packet switched networks and connects to one or more SGSNs via an Internet Protocol IP backbone network operated within the network . During normal operations a given communication device must perform a GPRS Attach to acquire an IP address and to access data services. This requirement is not present in circuit switched voice channels as Integrated Services Digital Network ISDN addresses are used for routing incoming and outgoing calls. Currently all GPRS capable networks use private dynamically assigned IP addresses thus requiring the DHCP server connected to the GGSN . There are many mechanisms for dynamic IP assignment including using a combination of a Remote Authentication Dial In User Service RADIUS server and a DHCP server. Once the GPRS Attach is complete a logical connection is established from a communication device through the PCU and the SGSN to an Access Point Node APN within the GGSN . The APN represents a logical end of an IP tunnel that can either access direct Internet compatible services or private network connections. The APN also represents a security mechanism for the network insofar as each communication device must be assigned to one or more APNs and communication devices cannot exchange data without first performing a GPRS Attach to an APN that it has been authorized to use. The APN can be considered to be similar to an Internet domain name such as myconnection.wireless.com .

Once the GPRS Attach operation is complete a tunnel is created and all traffic is exchanged within standard IP packets using any protocol that can be supported in IP packets. This includes tunneling methods such as IP over IP as in the case with some IPSecurity Ipsec connections used with Virtual Private Networks VPN . These tunnels are also referred to as Packet Data Protocol PDP Contexts and there are a limited number of these available in the network . To maximize use of the PDP Contexts the network will run an idle timer for each PDP Context to determine if there is a lack of activity. When a communication device is not using its PDP Context the PDP Context can be de allocated and the IP address returned to the IP address pool managed by the DHCP server .

The host system comprises a number of network components connected to each other by a network . For instance a user s desktop computer with an accompanying cradle for the user s communication device is situated on a LAN connection. The cradle for the communication device can be coupled to the computer by a serial or a Universal Serial Bus USB connection for example. Other user computers are also situated on the network and each can be equipped with an accompanying cradle . The cradle facilitates the loading of information e.g. PIM data private symmetric encryption keys to facilitate secure communications from the user computer to the communication device and can be particularly useful for bulk information updates often performed in initializing the communication device for use. The information downloaded to the communication device can include certificates used in the exchange of messages.

It will be understood by persons skilled in the art that the user computers are typically also connected to other peripheral devices such as printers etc. which are not explicitly shown in . Furthermore only a subset of network components of the host system are shown in for ease of exposition and it will be understood by persons skilled in the art that the host system will comprise additional components that are not explicitly shown in for this exemplary configuration. More generally the host system can represent a smaller part of a larger network not shown of the organization and can comprise different components and or be arranged in different topologies than that shown in the exemplary embodiment of .

To facilitate the operation of the communication device and the wireless communication of messages and message related data between the communication device and components of the host system a number of wireless communication support components can be provided. In some implementations the wireless communication support components can include a message management server a mobile data server a web server such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP server a contact server and a device manager module . HTTP servers can also be located outside the enterprise system as indicated by the HTTP server attached to the network . The device manager module includes an IT Policy editor and an IT user property editor as well as other software components for allowing an IT administrator to configure the communication devices . In an alternative embodiment there can be one editor that provides the functionality of both the IT policy editor and the IT user property editor . The support components also include a data store and an IT policy server . The IT policy server includes a processor a network interface and a memory unit . The processor controls the operation of the IT policy server and executes functions related to the standardized IT policy as described below. The network interface allows the IT policy server to communicate with the various components of the host system and the communication devices . The memory unit can store functions used in implementing the IT policy as well as related data. Those skilled in the art know how to implement these various components. Other components can also be included as is well known to those skilled in the art. Further in some implementations the data store can be part of any one of the servers.

In this exemplary embodiment the communication device communicates with the host system through node of the wireless network and a shared network infrastructure such as a service provider network or the public Internet. Access to the host system can be provided through one or more routers not shown and computing devices of the host system can operate from behind a firewall or proxy server . The proxy server provides a secure node and a wireless internet gateway for the host system . The proxy server intelligently routes data to the correct destination server within the host system .

In some implementations the host system can include a wireless VPN router not shown to facilitate data exchange between the host system and the communication device . The wireless VPN router allows a VPN connection to be established directly through a specific wireless network to the communication device . The wireless VPN router can be used with the Internet Protocol IP Version 6 IPV6 and IP based wireless networks. This protocol can provide enough IP addresses so that each mobile device has a dedicated IP address making it possible to push information to a mobile device at any time. An advantage of using a wireless VPN router is that it can be an off the shelf VPN component and does not require a separate wireless gateway and separate wireless infrastructure. A VPN connection can preferably be a Transmission Control Protocol TCP IP or User Datagram Protocol UDP IP connection for delivering the messages directly to the communication device in this alternative implementation.

Messages intended for a user of the communication device are initially received by a message server of the host system . Such messages can originate from any number of sources. For instance a message can have been sent by a sender from the computer within the host system from a different mobile device not shown connected to the wireless network or a different wireless network or from a different computing device or other device capable of sending messages via the shared network infrastructure possibly through an application service provider ASP or Internet service provider ISP for example.

The message server typically acts as the primary interface for the exchange of messages particularly e mail messages within the organization and over the shared network infrastructure . Each user in the organization that has been set up to send and receive messages is typically associated with a user account managed by the message server . Some exemplary implementations of the message server include a Microsoft Exchange server a Lotus Domino server a Novell Groupwise server or another suitable mail server installed in a corporate environment. In some implementations the host system can comprise multiple message servers . The message server can also be adapted to provide additional functions beyond message management including the management of data associated with calendars and task lists for example.

When messages are received by the message server they are typically stored in a data store associated with the message server . In at least some embodiments the data store can be a separate hardware unit such as data store with which the message server communicates. Messages can be subsequently retrieved and delivered to users by accessing the message server . For instance an e mail client application operating on a user s computer can request the e mail messages associated with that user s account stored on the data store associated with the message server . These messages are then retrieved from the data store and stored locally on the computer . The data store associated with the message server can store copies of each message that is locally stored on the communication device . Alternatively the data store associated with the message server can store all of the messages for the user of the communication device and only a smaller number of messages can be stored on the communication device to conserve memory. For instance the most recent messages i.e. those received in the past two to three months for example can be stored on the communication device .

When operating the communication device the user may wish to have e mail messages retrieved for delivery to the communication device . The message application operating on the communication device can also request messages associated with the user s account from the message server . The message application can be configured either by the user or by an administrator possibly in accordance with an organization s IT policy to make this request at the direction of the user at some pre defined time interval or upon the occurrence of some pre defined event. In some implementations the communication device is assigned its own e mail address and messages addressed specifically to the communication device are automatically redirected to the communication device as they are received by the message server .

The message management server can be used to specifically provide support for the management of messages such as e mail messages that are to be handled by mobile devices. Generally while messages are still stored on the message server the message management server can be used to control when if and how messages are sent to the communication device . The message management server also facilitates the handling of messages composed on the communication device which are sent to the message server for subsequent delivery.

For example the message management server can monitor the user s mailbox e.g. the message store associated with the user s account on the message server for new e mail messages and apply user definable filters to new messages to determine if and how the messages are relayed to the user s communication device . The message management server can also through an encoder not shown associated therewith compress message data using any suitable compression decompression technology e.g. YK compression JPEG MPEG x H.26x and other known techniques and encrypt messages e.g. using an encryption technique such as Data Encryption Standard DES Triple DES or Advanced Encryption Standard AES and push them to the communication device via the shared network infrastructure and the wireless network . The message management server can also receive messages composed on the communication device e.g. encrypted using Triple DES decrypt and decompress the composed messages re format the composed messages if desired so that they will appear to have originated from the user s computer and re route the composed messages to the message server for delivery.

Certain properties or restrictions associated with messages that are to be sent from and or received by the communication device can be defined e.g. by an administrator in accordance with IT policy and enforced by the message management server . These may include whether the communication device can receive encrypted and or signed messages minimum encryption key sizes whether outgoing messages must be encrypted and or signed and whether copies of all secure messages sent from the communication device are to be sent to a pre defined copy address for example.

The message management server can also be adapted to provide other control functions such as only pushing certain message information or pre defined portions e.g. blocks of a message stored on the message server to the communication device . For example in some cases when a message is initially retrieved by the communication device from the message server the message management server can push only the first part of a message to the communication device with the part being of a pre defined size e.g. 2 KB . The user can then request that more of the message be delivered in similar sized blocks by the message management server to the communication device possibly up to a maximum pre defined message size. Accordingly the message management server facilitates better control over the type of data and the amount of data that is communicated to the communication device and can help to minimize potential waste of bandwidth or other resources.

The mobile data server encompasses any other server that stores information that is relevant to the corporation. The mobile data server can include but is not limited to databases online data document repositories customer relationship management CRM systems or enterprise resource planning ERP applications. The mobile data server can also connect to the Internet or other public network through HTTP server or other suitable web server such as a File Transfer Protocol FTP server to retrieve HTTP webpages and other data. Requests for webpages are typically routed through mobile data server and then to HTTP server through suitable firewalls and other protective mechanisms. The web server then retrieves the webpage over the Internet and returns it to mobile data server . As described above in relation to message management server mobile data server is typically provided or associated with an encoder that permits retrieved data such as retrieved webpages to be decompressed and compressed using any suitable compression technology e.g. YK compression JPEG MPEG x H.26x and other known techniques and encrypted e.g. using an encryption technique such as DES Triple DES or AES and then pushed to the communication device via the shared network infrastructure and the wireless network . While encoder is only shown for mobile data server it will be appreciated that each of message server message management server and HTTP servers and can also have an encoder associated therewith.

The contact server can provide information for a list of contacts for the user in a similar fashion as the address book on the communication device . Accordingly for a given contact the contact server can include the name phone number work address and e mail address of the contact among other information. The contact server can also provide a global address list that contains the contact information for all of the contacts associated with the host system .

It will be understood by persons skilled in the art that the message management server the mobile data server the HTTP server the contact server the device manager module the data store and the IT policy server do not need to be implemented on separate physical servers within the host system . For example some or all of the functions associated with the message management server can be integrated with the message server or some other server in the host system . Alternatively the host system can comprise multiple message management servers particularly in variant implementations where a large number of mobile devices need to be supported.

The device manager module provides an IT administrator with a graphical user interface with which the IT administrator interacts to configure various settings for the communication devices . As mentioned the IT administrator can use IT policy rules to define behaviors of certain applications on the communication device that are permitted such as phone web browser or Instant Messenger use. The IT policy rules can also be used to set specific values for configuration settings that an organization requires on the communication devices such as auto signature text WLAN VoIP VPN configuration security requirements e.g. encryption algorithms password rules etc. specifying themes or applications that are allowed to run on the communication device and the like.

A user may wish to access multiple services operating over the same or different networks and providing messages in different formats which may include without limiting the scope of such services e mail IM SMS MMS voicemail and VVM and the like or multiple services providing messages in the same communication format. For example the user may wish to access at the communication device e mail messages received by a user account maintained by the user s enterprise system as well as e mail messages received by an account provided by a third party service provider. The user may also wish to access messages provided by other messaging or analogous services for example content published by a content provider and pushed to the communication device via a push server in communication with the device over the wireless network. Such content may include updates or postings received from a social networking service a news feed or other content feed.

Such messages and other content may be received and stored in distinct data stores folders or files at the device together with messages and content generated at the device for transmission via the associated service. For example each message or content item received or generated at the device may be stored as a separate message or data object in a data store associated with the service and may be retrievable for presentation to the user using a dedicated application executing at the device and associated with that particular message or content format. In addition the objects may be indexed for searching on the device either through the dedicated application itself or through a unified search process implemented in the device operating system and retrievable for presentation in a unified inbox displayable at the device . The unified inbox may be defined conceptually or visually to the user as a message inbox having characteristics similar to those employed in respect of mail clients known in the art but it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the unified inbox as referred to herein need not be limited strictly to such an implementation. The unified inbox may also be considered as a global message or content list or as a unified view of message or other content information that serves as an entry point for access to a service or application executable on the device. When the unified inbox is invoked message objects and other content may be retrieved by a collector process from one or more data stores or folders available to the device for presentation in a unified inbox display. The message or content elements displayed in the unified inbox display may include in the case of messages such as e mail header data such as sender timestamp and subject line. In addition or alternatively at least a portion of the message body content may also be displayed. In the case of other message types such as instant messages the information displayed may include message body content in place of message header content.

However the user may wish to segregate messages received from different messaging services for example to keep work related messages received by the enterprise account separate from personal messages received at accounts provided by other services or to exclude content from social network feeds from the unified inbox while still including all messages and similar content from other sources in the unified inbox. This may be accomplished by providing separate entry points for filtered subsets of message objects collected by the collector process for the unified inbox or by providing application entry points for each distinct message or content service provided at the device . Each of these entry points may be made easily accessible to the user through the display of associated user interface elements such as icons in a graphical user interface displayed at the device . Since a number of message and content services may be provided on the device a means for managing the availability of entry points and associated user interface elements may be desirable.

The various message and content services mentioned above may be discovered and provisioned or registered at the device using a number of techniques that will be known to those skilled in the art. Two possible techniques for provisioning or registering a service at the communication device are injection of a service record pertaining to the service at the device and registration using an API. As a non limiting example of service record injection referring to a request for registration may be sent from the communication device to a registration server of a service not shown . If the request is approved the registration server may transmit to the communication device a service book containing data and instructions to enable the communication device to provision the service. The service book when received at the communication device may be self executing and may permit the user to enter account information relevant to the associated service. This information is stored in a service record at the device . The service book may store several service records each corresponding to a messaging service provisioned for the device . User account can also be transmitted from the communication device to a provisioning server of the service provider such as the server . If required the provisioning server creates a new primary service account for the user or else associates the transmitted information with an existing account for the user. Thus if the communication device is provisioned for a message service provided by the message server of FIG. A the primary service account is created at the message server . The service may comprise both a primary service account and an associated service account for example while a primary service account may provide e mail service for the user an associated service account provided by either the primary service provider or an associated service provider may handle the forwarding or redirection of messages from the primary service account to the communication device . In other variants the provisioning process may be managed by a communications carrier via a carrier provisioning server which may provide a front end system for a value added service provided by the service provider server as illustrated by the dotted arrows in .

Not all message or content services need be provisioned by adding or injecting records into a service book or a similar service data repository. As another example applications installed by the user or an administrator may register or deregister with management module such as an API provided at the device. Registration with the API provides the application with access to other functions and features of the device operating system including management and storage of folders and other data structures containing application related data such as messages and other content as well as eligibility of application related messages and content for inclusion in the unified inbox.

Once the messaging service or messaging application hereinafter called a service for ease of reference is provisioned or otherwise installed or registered at the communication device the communication device may transmit data to and receive data from the primary service. When the service is provisioned or registered indicators specific to the service may be downloaded and stored or otherwise defined at the communication device . These indicators which may be provided in the form of a user interface element such as an icon or other graphical representation may be optionally displayed to the user via a graphical user interface as discussed below to provide the user of the communication device with a means for accessing an entry point for that service. The communication device may maintain a registry of data pertaining to all services provisioned on the communication device and the graphical user interface of the communication device may be configured to automatically display an indicator for each entry point for each such service listed in the registry. Each such indicator may include a pointer or address identifying its associated service entry point. If an indicator is associated with the listed service the graphical user interface may display that indicator otherwise a default indicator may be displayed. A registry stored at the communication device may comprise a record for each provisioned or registered service. Each record in addition to data required for communication with the service may also comprise one or more fields with URL or other address information for retrieving content such as an icon graphic to display for the entry point corresponding to the service. If such address information is present the communication device may retrieve the indicator from that address for display on the device display . If no address for retrieving such content is provided in the registry the communication device may display a default indicator.

In some instances several similar services such as several e mail services provided by different service providers may be provisioned or registered at the device. In other instances several different services such as e mail SMS and VVM provided by one or more service providers may be registered or provisioned at the device. In either case in one embodiment all messages received via these different services may be displayed to the user on the communication device in the unified inbox. This provides the user with easy access to all messages received at the communication device regardless of provenance. In this manner a user interface of the communication device may provide a single display representative of multiple service entry points to the user since each element displayed in the unified inbox may be actuatable to invoke a separate application or view associated with the particular message or content format of that element. An exemplary graphical user interface is illustrated in . A single indicator representative of a service entry point for a unified inbox is presented in the graphical user interface . The user interface may represent a home screen or landing screen using which the user may access applications and services provided at the device . The user may actuate this service entry point to invoke a messaging application to gain access to the unified inbox which may contain messages received via one or more services. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that references to an inbox such as a unified inbox are not limited to data stores or views of incoming messages. Inboxes may comprise received messages sent or pending messages folders or other repositories of message or content data including but not limited to the various formats of messages and content described herein. An example of a unified inbox is shown displayed in the user interface of which includes a single listing of messages . Although not shown in the messages displayed in the user interface may include messages or content sent or received using different user accounts associated with applications or services provided at the device and in different formats as mentioned above.

In another embodiment one or more indicators associated with one or more service entry points may be provided to the user via the user interface. As shown in the graphical user interface comprises the first service entry point indicator and a second service entry point indicator . In this example the indicator is representative of an e mail inbox. While the first indicator is associated with the unified inbox as described above the second indicator is expressly associated with a defined account here identified with an e mail address which is truncated in the user interface as eblofeld . . . . Thus actuation via the user interface of the first indicator may invoke the messaging application associated with the unified inbox thus presenting a view similar to that of actuation of the second indicator may invoke a further messaging application or a further instance of the first messaging application that retrieves and displays only messages associated with that defined account. However if the only message or content service provisioned or registered at the device is the service associated with that defined account the result of actuating the first indicator and the second indicator will be the same both may result in the display of the user interface of .

Thus first service entry point indicator may be associated with the unified inbox while the remaining service entry point indicators are associated with separate services which may include entry points for filtered views of the unified inbox content that are also registered or provisioned on the device . Thus messages or content received or transmitted via one of the separate services associated with service entry point indicators may be displayed both in an inbox associated with that indicator as well as in the unified inbox. There may of course be further services provided at the device and fourth fifth or further indicators displayed in the user interface for example as shown in the example of which includes a fourth indicator that may correspond to still a further service.

Optionally the communication device may be configured to hide messages that are displayable in inboxes associated with the service entry points . This may be configured by the user of the communication device or by an administrator. For example depicts an options interface displayable on the display of the communication device . The options interface provides configuration options which may be selected for the messaging services provided at the communication device . One configuration option in this example is an Inbox Management option which may be used to define the message types that are included in the unified inbox. illustrates a possible user interface providing configuration options for inbox management which provides options for selecting one or more of the accounts of services provisioned on the device such that messages associated with that account or service are displayed in the unified mailbox on the device . In the example of two e mail accounts are provisioned a first desktop account eblofeld spectre.com which may be associated with an enterprise system such as host system and an account associated with an Internet service provider ernst bleuville.com . There are accordingly entries for the two accounts selected in the first options area of the user interface . If other services are available on the communication device they may be listed in this options interface as well. Text visual voicemail and a data push service are also listed in the second options area . Selection of these various accounts and message types may thus define the scope of messages displayed in the unified inbox and the types of messages that are therefore hidden from view in the unified inbox. The option to show or hide the messages may also be stored in the registry described above. If messages associated with a service are thus configured to be hidden the unified inbox may therefore no longer represent a unified collection of messages associated with every service registered on the communication device .

A service may be made available for selection in the options interface once it is provisioned on the communication device or upon registration with the API as described above. A listener process operating at the device may detect the addition of services by provisioning or registration and provide a notification to a configuration interface function to include these services and their related accounts in the configuration screen

As suggested above when only one messaging service is provisioned on the communication device it is not necessary to display both a service entry point indicator for a unified inbox as well as a separate service entry point indicator for that messaging service since the content of the unified inbox and the inbox associated with the messaging service may contain identical data. Thus when the communication device is provisioned with only a first messaging account the communication device may be configured to automatically hide the service entry point indicator associated with that account in favour of displaying only the service entry point indicator for the unified inbox. This process is illustrated in . At prior a first service being provisioned or registered at the communication device only the unified inbox indicator icon is displayed. At the addition of a new service Service is detected for example using the aforementioned listener process or by otherwise detecting an insertion of a service record for Service in the registry. As a result at the communication device continues to display only the indicator for the unified inbox.

The user or administrator of the communication device may elect to display the indicator for the service entry point associated with the first service regardless of whether the inbox associated with a second service entry point would be duplicative of the unified inbox. Thus in at only the unified inbox indicator is displayed although the communication device has been provisioned with a first service associated with a first account. At detection of an instruction to mark the service entry point associated with that first service and account as visible . Consequently at both the service entry point indicators for the unified inbox and the first service are displayed in the graphical user interface of the communication device for example as shown in . This process may be reversed as shown in . While both the service entry point indicators for the unified inbox and the first service Service are displayed at an instruction is detected to mark the service entry point associated with the first service as hidden . Consequently only the service entry point indicator for the unified inbox is displayed in the device s graphical user interface.

When a service is deleted from the registry or deregistered via the API the service entry point indicator corresponding to that service no longer needs to be displayed in the graphical user interface. As shown in initially the communication device may be configured to display two service entry point indicators one for the unified inbox and one for the first service Service. At deletion of the first service from the registry or deregistration is detected. Accordingly the communication device displays only the service entry point indicator for the unified inbox at .

As noted above when only a first service is provisioned or registered at the communication device it may be deemed unnecessary to display both a service entry point indicator for the service and a service entry point indicator for the unified inbox so the communication device may be configured to automatically hide the service entry point indicator associated with that first service. However when a second service is provisioned or registered at the communication device it may be desirable to access separate service entry points for each of the first and second services in addition to the unified inbox so that the user is provided with the ability to easily access messages associated only with the first service only with the second service or with both. If separate access means to the entry points for the first or second service are not provided in the user interface then the user may be required to invoke the unified inbox select a message associated with the desired service then actuate the selected message in order to invoke an application providing access to the desired message inbox. Alternatively the user may be required to navigate to an applications folder to locate and invoke an entry point for the application related to the message. It will be understood that these alternatives increase the time required for the user to access the desired message inbox and requires increased manipulation of input devices such as the trackball touchscreen interface touchpad and the like potentially resulting in increased wear and tear on the device s input systems. Thus as indicated in at only the service entry point indicator for the unified inbox is displayed service records are injected into the registry or any services are otherwise provisioned or registered at the device. At services Service and Service are added for first and second messaging services respectively. Consequently at the user interface of the communication device may display three service entry point indicators for the unified inbox the first service and the second service. The user interface would thus change from displaying only one service entry point indicator such as in to three as in .

A similar result to block results if the communication device originally provisioned or registered with a single service is configured to display both the service entry point indicators for the unified inbox and for the first service Service as shown in at . The service entry point indicator associated with Service is displayed in response to an instruction to expressly show that service entry point indicator as described with respect to . When a new service such as Service is added at the result is that three service entry point indicators may be displayed in the graphical user interface of the device similar to the result of .

Subsequently if one of the services is removed from the device and thus has its service records deleted or is deregistered the number of service entry point indicators displayed at the device is changed. Turning to the communication device initially displays service entry point indicators for the unified inbox and each of a first and second service Service Service respectively. At Service is removed. Consequently at only the service entry point indicators for the unified inbox and the first service Service are shown. It should be recalled that the service entry point indicator associated with the first service is shown in the end result of this process because there had been a previous instruction to expressly make that service entry point indicator visible as discussed with respect to . If the communication device initially displayed service entry point indicators for each of the unified inbox and each of the first and second services as shown in at and then had chosen to hide the service entry point indicator for the first service then as a result the user interface of the communication device would display only the service entry point indicators for the unified inbox and the second service at .

The processes described above are represented in the generic processes illustrated in . illustrates a process for managing the display of indicators such as icons on a user interface display such as a home screen. At initially only a unified inbox indicator or icon is displayed. At this stage there may or may not be services already provisioned or registered at the communication device . At the addition of a service is detected as described above. A determination is made at whether other services are already provisioned or registered at the device for example by querying a registry at the device. . If there are no other services currently provisioned or registered then the added service is the first service a determination is made at whether an instruction has been received to mark the service as visible and if so an indicator for both it and the unified inbox is displayed at . Otherwise only the unified inbox icon is displayed. However if other services are already registered or provisioned on the device then at not only the indicator for the unified inbox is displayed but also the indicators for all currently registered or provisioned services provided those services had not been marked as hidden.

An instruction to mark a service as hidden or visible may be received via the options interfaces or when the communication device is in a configuration mode. Alternatively an option to hide select service entry points and associated indicators may be provided when the service entry point indicators are displayed. As shown in the graphical user interface is shown with service entry point indicators and as well as other application entry point indicators for various applications. This particular view of the user interface may be considered a home screen as it provides general access to various services and applications on the device . In this example functionality is provided to permit control of the visibility of application entry point icons on the home screen but in some embodiments it can also be used to control visibility of the messaging service entry point icons on the home screen as well. When a given service or application entry point indicator is in focus for example the entry point indicator is shown in focus as indicated by outline the user may invoke a context menu which may provide one or more options including an option to hide the entry point in focus . The foregoing thus provides a system and method for determining which service entry point indicators associated with the provisioned services are displayed on the home screen and which are hidden. In the embodiments described above unless specified otherwise service entry point indicators associated with each individual provisioned or registered service may be displayed in the graphical user interface only if more than one service is provisioned or registered on the communication device . If only one provisioned or registered service is available then the service entry point indicator associated with that service may be hidden by default and only the service entry point indicator for a unified inbox may be displayed.

The foregoing methods and systems of automatically managing the display of user interface elements such as the aforementioned service entry point indicators provides for automatic reduction of the number of user interface elements displayable within the home screen of the device with consequent savings in processing resources required to render and display the various user interface elements on the home screen.

The graphical user interface may provide additional information regarding the mailboxes associated with each service. Referring again to when a service entry point indicator for a given service is in focus the communication device may display on the user interface a message count indicating the number of unread messages and additionally or alternatively an indicator indicating the presence of new messages in the associated inbox. If the focus is moved to the service entry point indicator corresponding to the unified inbox the message count may comprise a global message count across all existing inboxes or alternatively only for those messages displayable in the unified inbox as well as the optional new message indicator. If the focus is moved to another indicator in the user interface not related to a messaging service the user interface may display the global message count and the optional new message indicator.

A method for tracking unread message counts is shown in . At the communication device receives a message. A thread or listener process tracking received and read or unread messages for the services on the device is notified at and the count of unread messages is updated accordingly. At a global count such as that shown in the indicator is updated to reflect the new total of unread messages and to reflect the existence of new unread messages since the last time any message listing was displayed. In an alternative embodiment illustrated in the indicator may instead display the status of messages for a particular service whose indicator is currently in focus in the user interface. At the communication device receives a message and a process tracking received messages for the service through which the message was received is notified at . The communication device then determines at whether a service entry point indicator for that particular service is in focus on the user interface . If it is in focus then the count of unread messages is updated on the user interface and the new message indicator may be updated as well at . If the service entry point indicator for that particular service is not in focus the communication device may be configured to display the global total of unread messages as a default setting in which case the count of unread messages is updated on the user interface to reflect the new global total at and the new message indicator may be updated as well. The device then waits for further messages at although the count of unread messages and the new message indicator may be updated in the meantime as the user invokes messaging applications and reads messages and listener processes detect changes to the inbox states associated with the various services. In a further alternative the communication device may consistently display the global count regardless of which user interface element is in focus in the user interface

As a further option the labels and icons provided for each service entry point may be configurable by the user. For example customized icons may be downloaded or created for each service. Also as shown in a label is provided under each indicator for each service entry point. For a message service entry point this label could provide the account name or user s account address for the corresponding service but the name or address may be truncated due to excessive length. An option may be provided for the user to configure the service entry point indicator to display a nickname or abbreviated name of the user s choosing.

It will be appreciated that various services may be provided by entities affiliated with the user while other services are provided by third party service providers. A first messaging account may be provided by an enterprise service associated with the user for example using the message server of whereas other messaging accounts may be provided by third party Internet service providers. In one embodiment the visibility of the service entry points indicators associated with third party Internet service providers may be configurable at the communication device by the user through the use of the options described above while the visibility of the service entry point indicator associated with the enterprise service may be configurable only by an administrator of the enterprise system. However by implementing the automated method of determining the display of various user interface elements pointing to service entry points it is not necessary for an administrator of the host system to define rules concerning the display of entry point indicators and to push these rules to the communication device thus reducing the amount of data required to be transmitted to the device .
