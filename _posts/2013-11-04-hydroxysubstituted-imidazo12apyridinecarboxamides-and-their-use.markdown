The present application relates to novel substituted imidazo 1 2 a pyridine 3 carboxamides to processes for their preparation to their use alone or in combinations for the treatment and or prophylaxis of diseases and to their use for preparing medicaments for the treatment and or prophylaxis of diseases in particular for the treatment and or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders.

One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate cGMP . Together with nitric oxide NO which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals it forms the NO cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyse the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate GTP . The representatives of this family disclosed to date can be divided both according to structural features and according to the type of ligands into two groups the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one haem per heterodimer which is part of the regulatory site. The latter is of central importance for the mechanism of activation. NO is able to bind to the iron atom of haem and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Haem free preparations cannot by contrast be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide CO is also able to attach to the central iron atom of haem but the stimulation by CO is distinctly less than that by NO.

Through the production of cGMP and the regulation resulting therefrom of phosphodiesterases ion channels and protein kinases guanylate cyclase plays a crucial part in various physiological processes in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells in platelet aggregation and adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission and in disorders caused by an impairment of the aforementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions the NO cGMP system may be suppressed which may lead for example to high blood pressure platelet activation increased cellular proliferation endothelial dysfunction atherosclerosis angina pectoris heart failure myocardial infarction thromboses stroke and sexual dysfunction.

A possible way of treating such disorders which is independent of NO and aims at influencing the cGMP signaling pathway in organisms is a promising approach because of the high efficiency and few side effects which are to be expected.

Compounds such as organic nitrates whose effect is based on NO have to date been exclusively used for the therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase. NO is produced by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attaching to the central iron atom of haem. Besides the side effects the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment.

Over the last years a number of substances which stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase directly. i.e. without prior release of NO have been described for example 3 5 hydroxymethyl 2 furyl 1 benzylindazole YC 1 Wu et al. 84 1994 4226 M lsch et al. 120 1997 681 fatty acids Goldberg et al. 252 1977 1279 diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate Pettibone et al. 116 1985 307 isoliquiritigenin Yu et al. 114 1995 1587 and also various substituted pyrazole derivatives WO 98 16223 .

In the process steps described above any functional groups present such as in particular amino hydroxyl and carboxyl groups may if expedient or required also be present in protected form. Here the introduction and removal of such protective groups is carried out by customary methods see for example T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts Wiley New York 1999 M. Bodanszky and A.

The ring closure is usually carried out in a temperature range from 50 C. to 150 C. preferably at from 50 C. to 100 C. if appropriate in a microwave oven.

The ring closure VIII IX II or VII IX X is optionally carried out in the presence of dehydrating agents for example in the presence of molecular sieve pore size 4 or using a water separator. The reaction VIII IX II or VII IX X is carried out using an excess of the reagent of the formula IX for example using 1 to 20 equivalents of reagent IX if appropriate with addition of bases such as sodium bicarbonate where the addition of this reagent can be carried out once or in several portions.

Alternatively to the introductions of Rshown in Schemes 1 to 4 by reaction of the compounds V VII or X with compounds of the formula VI it is also possible as shown in Scheme 5 to react these intermediates with alcohols of the formula XI under the conditions of the Mitsunobu reaction.

Typical reaction conditions for such Mitsunobu condensations of phenols with alcohols can be found in the relevant literature for example Hughes D. L. 1992 42 335 Dembinski R. 2004 2763. Typically the compound is reacted with an activating agent for example diethyl azodicarboxylate DEAD or diisopropyl azodicarboxylate DIAD and a phosphine reagent for example triphenylphosphine or tributylphosphine in an inert solvent for example THF dichloromethane toluene or DMF at a temperature between 0 C. and the boiling point of the solvent employed.

Further compounds according to the invention can optionally also be prepared by converting functional groups of individual substituents in particular those listed under R starting with the compounds of the formula I obtained by the above processes. These conversions are carried out by customary methods known to the person skilled in the art and include for example reactions such as nucleophilic and electrophilic substitutions oxidations reductions hydrogenations transition metal catalyzed coupling reactions eliminations alkylations aminations esterifications ester cleavages etherifications ether cleavages formation of carboxamides and also the introduction and removal of temporary protective groups.

The taking of blood from rats is simplified by inserting a silicone catheter into the right prior to substance administration. The operation is carried out at least one day prior to the experiment with isofluran analgesia and administration of an analgesic atropin Rimadyl 3 1 0.1 ml s.c. . The blood is taken generally more than 10 time points within a time window including terminal time points of at least 24 to a maximum of 72 hours after substance administration. When the blood is taken it is passed into heparinised tubes. Then the blood plasma is obtained by centrifugation and is optionally stored at 20 C. until further processing.

An internal standard which may also be a chemically unrelated substance is added to the samples of the compounds according to the invention calibration samples and qualifiers and there follows protein precipitation by means of excess acetonitrile. Addition of a buffer solution matched to the LC conditions and subsequent vortexing is followed by centrifugation at 1000 g. The supernatant is analysed by LC MS MS using C18 reversed phase columns and variable mobile phase mixtures.

The substances are quantified via the peak heights or areas from extracted ion chromatograms of specific selected ion monitoring experiments.

The plasma concentration time plots determined are used to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters such as AUC C t terminal half life F Bioavailability MRT Mean Residence Time and CL Clearance using a validated pharmacokinetic calculation programme.

Since the substance quantification is carried out in plasma it is necessary to determine the blood plasma distribution of the substance in order to be able to adjust the pharmacokinetic parameters correspondingly. For this purpose a defined amount of substance is incubated in heparinised whole blood of the species in question in a rocking roller mixer for 20 min. After centrifugation at 1000 g the plasma concentration is measured by means of LC MS MS see above and determined by calculating the ratio of the C Cvalue.
