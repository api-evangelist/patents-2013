This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 073 799 filed Mar. 28 2011 which is incorporated herein by reference as part of the present disclosure.

The present invention generally relates to online transactions and in particular to placing orders online

Ordering ahead of time provides consumers the advantage of not having to wait for an order to be ready. Ordering can be physical goods drinks food etc. For example a consumer can call a restaurant to order food to go or a consumer can place an online order for goods or a food order. After ordering the consumer may go to a physical location to pick up the ordered items.

However phone orders can be cumbersome and costly because the consumer needs to find and dial a number talk to a person which may take a while if the person is busy and or have the order misunderstood. The payee e.g. a restaurant incurs costs for having a person be available to answer and take orders from the consumer as well as lost profits or revenue with incorrect orders.

Online orders alleviate some of these disadvantages. However the consumer may feel that online ordering is too time consuming especially for regular or repeat orders the consumer makes to the same merchant or retailer. Some sites allow the user to save previous orders for simplified repeat ordering but this does not help users who are away from their computers and may only have their mobile device. Due to the small data input keypads and screens it may be difficult for the user to access the merchant site log into the consumer s account and navigate to find the ordering page.

In different aspects of the present disclosure a consumer or user transmits a word or phrase to place an order. The word or phrase is associated with a particular order at one or more different merchants sellers or retailers such that details of the order can be obtained from the word or phrase. As a result the user can quickly and easily place an order electronically by simply entering a word or phrase.

In one embodiment the user identifies specific items or goods to be associated with a word or phrase. For example with a food order the user may equate one large thin crust pepperoni pizza with extra cheese one liter of water one meatball sub and two sausage calzones at Gino s Pizza Palace with the phrase party1 ginos. This information is stored by an entity involved in the transaction which may include the merchant a payment provider or third party service provider. Once the entity receives the phrase the entity may determine the specifics of the order such as items and merchant s and the user such as through cookies device ID or other user device identifier.

If the entity is the merchant the merchant processes the order. The user may make the payment when picking up the order or when the order is released such as in person through the merchant site or other means. If the entity is a payment provider the payment provider sends the detailed order to the merchant for processing and then handles the payment from the user to the merchant. If the entity is a third party service provider such as a website offering this service the entity may send the detailed order to the merchant and communicate with a payment provider to handle payment.

In one embodiment the user communicates the word or phrase through a social network such as Twitter . Other ways to communicate may include through a website using the user s mobile device through voice or text using the user s computing device through emails etc.

The user may set up many different words or phrases for different orders. An order does not need to be for a single merchant but can be with different merchants. For example the user may consolidate an order with multiple merchants all located in the same location such as a mall. The user may set up an order to include a turkey and avocado sandwich with light mayonnaise and mustard on sourdough and a medium diet Coke at Joe s Subs a large vanilla frozen yogurt with chocolate chip topping at Yum Yum Frozen Yogurt and two boxes of Pamper s size 4 diapers and four boxes of Mom s Baby Formula at Winnie s Pharmacy. This order is associated with the phrase lunch and baby at mall. 

Thus a user can place an order quickly and easily even a complicated order with multiple items from multiple merchants by simply entering a word or phrase into a user device such as a phone.

These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.

Next the user may access at step the user s account with the payment provider such as by providing a user identifier and password PIN or other authenticating credentials. This can be done manually automatically or a combination of both such as through cookies device IDs remember me functionalities auto fills and entry through keypads keyboards or voice. If the user does not have an account with the payment provider the user may be asked to create an account. Account creation may include the user providing certain information such as name user name password phone number address email date of birth bank account number credit card number and or any other information as requested.

Once within the user s account the user may select an option to set up the quick order feature at step . The user may select a tab on the user s account page click or tap a link or button or other means to make the selection. The user is then presented with information about how to set up the quick order feature.

The user may then enter requested information or follow instructions for setting up the feature. In this embodiment the user selects or identifies at step a merchant retailer restaurant or other entity or person with which the user will be placing the order with. Merchant may be used herein to refer to any of such entity or person. The selection or identification may be performed in any suitable way including but not limited to the user selecting participating merchants from a list or menu or the user using a search tool to find the merchant.

After the merchant is selected the user creates an order at step for that merchant. The user may select desired offerings such as items or services from the merchant site a listing on the payment provider site a pull down or drop down menu of available offerings which may be less than what is offered on the merchant s site from the payment provider site or any suitable means. Individually selected items may be edited as needed. For example if the user selects a shirt the user also selects a size. If the user selects a food item the user may also select substitutions additions and or deletions to the food item. For example if the user selects a pizza the user may select toppings the type of crust and the size. The user selects all desired items for this order from the selected merchant. At the end of the selection the user may confirm or edit the order as needed.

Once confirmed if the user wishes to add items to the order from a different merchant as determined at step the user selects the new merchant at step and continues the process described above.

Once the user has selected and confirmed all desired items from all desired merchants the user enters a word or phrase at step to identify the order. In one embodiment the user types in the word or phrase via a keyboard keypad or other data input means on a user device. In another embodiment the user inputs the word or phrase by voice such as speaking into the user device. Other entry means may also be suitable. The word or phrase may have enough descriptors so that the user can easily remember and use the word or phrase when needed. If the user ends up having many different quick order phrases each phrase may need to be even more descriptive. However if the user only has a few phrases the phrases may be more general.

In one example the user may select a word or phrase like order1 or food order if the user only has a few orders. Examples of more descriptive phrases include Burger Palace party order Sid s Sandwich diaper order diaper order Don s Drugs Newport Mall and the like. Optionally the user may confirm or edit the word phrase and order as needed or requested. Once confirmed or entered the system associates the word phrase with the details of the order and the user s account.

If the user wishes to set up another quick order phrase for another order as determined at step the user selects a merchant at step which may be the same as a previous merchant or a new merchant. The process continues until the user is finished with the session i.e. no more merchants or orders to add.

Note the user may also set limits or restrictions for the quick order feature. This along with other steps described above can be done in any feasible order. Examples of limits include but are not limited to prefunding a quick order account such that little or no additional authentication is needed when processing the order setting a minimum dollar amount or transaction number for a transaction a set number of transactions or a time period and setting an order amount in which little or no authentication would be needed. Such limitations may be applied to all orders some orders or for each order.

Next the user enters user information at step . User information may include a user identifier and or a user password PIN. The user identification may be a user name phone number email address etc. In some embodiments the user also enters a password or PIN. Entry of user information may be done in any number of ways including manually entering from a keypad or keyboard by voice etc. Note that entry of a user identifier and or a password PIN may be skipped in different embodiments. For example the user identification step may be skipped if the user ID is automatically communicated as part of the user communication such as through cookies a user phone number or device ID. Entering a password or PIN may be skipped if the user is authenticated without such data or the system does not require authentication such as if the user has a remember me type of functionality or pre authorized a setting that does not require authentication to use the quick order feature.

If the user does not have an account or the system cannot find a user account the user may be asked to re enter information or create an account. Account creation may include providing a user name password phone number email address address credit card information bank account information and or any other requested information by the system.

Next the user enters the quick order phrase at step . Again this can be done in any number of different ways. Examples include typing in the phrase using a device keyboard keypad or other data entry means selecting the phrase from a drop down menu or list of user phrases or speaking the phrase into an audio input.

Once entered or selected the user transmits the phrase at step . In one embodiment the user selects a return button or link a send button or link or the like. In another embodiment the user speaks into a device which transmits the audio phrase.

After transmission of the quick order phrase the system receives the phrase and determines at step whether the received phrase matches a phrase associated with the user. The system may access the user s account using received user information from step and retrieve quick order phrases associated with the account. The system may then determine if the received phrase matches with at least one of the phrases in the user s account. If there is no match the user may be requested to enter the phrase again at step .

Once a match is found the system determines details of the order at step . Details may include the exact description of an item or service a quantity of each item or service and merchant information for each item or service. As discussed above the order may include multiple merchants. The details of the order may then be communicated to the user. For example the user may see on a display of the user device a listing of the order from each merchant.

After receiving the order details the user determines at step whether to confirm the order. The user may choose not to confirm the order for any number of reasons including changing his her mind or wanting to modify or revise the order. For whatever reason if the user does not want to confirm the order as presented the user may edit the order at step . Editing the order may include canceling the order such as by selecting an appropriate button link or box. If however the user does not wish to cancel the order the user may revise as desired. For example the user can change one or more quantities remove one or more items add one or more items change details of one or more items etc. This may be accomplished in any number of ways including manually making the changes through a device input such as a keyboard keypad.

After the user is satisfied with the edited order from step or confirms the original order from step the order is processed at step . Order processing may include transmitting the details of the order to the appropriate merchant s debiting an appropriate amount from a user account crediting an appropriate amount to one or more merchant accounts notifying the merchant s and or the user of a successful transaction etc. The user may then pick up or otherwise receive the purchased items.

In one example a third party site which we will call TweetEat.com is used to process the quick order transaction. Merchants or restaurant food establishments sign up for the service on the site which can include account details contact information etc. The merchant uploads menu items to be offered and pricing to the site which may be a take out or full menu. The consumer also signs up for the service at the site which may include providing account details funding details one or more phrases associated with order details for a merchant password etc. Funding details may include account information for a payment provider such as PayPal.

When the consumer wishes to place a quick order the consumer tweets tweeteat with the quick order phrase. TweetEat handles the message and sends it to the merchant. The consumer s account is automatically debited for the amount of the order including any fees from the third party or payment provider. The customer then goes to the merchant and picks up the order such as by showing identification or a receipt.

Thus the user is able to quickly and easily place an order with one or more merchants saving both time and effort. These advantages may be even more pronounced with mobile devices which have smaller displays and keypads keyboards.

User device merchant server and payment provider server may each include one or more processors memories and other appropriate components for executing instructions such as program code and or data stored on one or more computer readable mediums to implement the various applications data and steps described herein.
