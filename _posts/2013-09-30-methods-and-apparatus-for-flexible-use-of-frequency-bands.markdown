This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 391 044 filed Feb. 17 2012 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 547 884 which is the National Stage of International Application No. PCT US2011 053494 filed Sep. 27 2011 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 404 153 filed Sep. 28 2010 the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

The disclosed embodiments relate in general to wireless or wire line communications and include methods and apparatus for flexible use of frequency bands or channels although these are merely exemplary and non limiting fields.

In a TV broadcasting system a UHF band a band in the 470 862 MHz range for example is often used for high power transmission via an antenna at a great height to cover a large area. As a result the usual practice is that this band and even its guard bands will not be used for high power broadcasting in the vicinities of the coverage area. These bands however may be re used in the neighboring areas for relatively low power transmission in a cellular system. Since the antenna of a cellular base station is located high up above the ground clutter the base station is vulnerable to high level interference from the TV broadcast transmission if cellular uplink transmission is in one of these bands. Consequently the use of a time division duplex TDD system in these bands may not be viable. Using a traditional frequency division duplex FDD system may also not be feasible since these bands may not have with a corresponding uplink band that is required for FDD operation.

To utilize the broadcast bands for cellular communications as described above a flexible method is needed to facilitate efficient use of radio resources. For example one of the broadcast guard bands may be used for downlink transmission and the flexible method can enable the system to use an available band e.g. one of the MMDS bands around 2.5 2.6 GHz for UL transmission.

The flexible method can be used to effectively utilize the spectrum that may become available from the switch from analogue to digital TV broadcasting. The use of a traditional FDD system with fixed pairing of downlink and uplink bands may not be feasible since bands in this spectrum do not come as fixed pairs for FDD transmission. Although TDD systems are being considered strictly synchronous transmission is required if adjacent bands are to be used which may prevent the use of multiple systems using different technologies or operators.

In one embodiment a method of communicating by a mobile device in a wireless communications system is disclosed. The wireless communications system utilizes frequency bands for downlink DL transmission and frequency bands for uplink UL transmission each frequency band having a center carrier frequency and an operation bandwidth. A DL signal is received via a first DL frequency band for DL transmission. The DL signal includes DL UL frequency band association information. The DL signal is decoded to obtain the DL UL frequency band association information. Based on the decoded DL UL frequency band association information a first UL frequency band is determined for UL transmission. Radio frequency RF circuitry of the mobile device is configured to operate in the first UL frequency band for UL transmission.

Certain specific details are set forth in the following description and figures to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the disclosure. Certain well known details often associated with computing and software technology are not set forth in the following disclosure to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the various embodiments of the disclosure. Further those of ordinary skill in the relevant art will understand that they can practice other embodiments of the disclosure without one or more of the details described below. Finally while various methods are described with reference to steps and sequences in the following disclosure the description as such is for providing a clear implementation of embodiments of the disclosure and the steps and sequences of steps should not be taken as required to practice this disclosure.

The terminology used in the description presented below is intended to be interpreted in its broadest reasonable manner even though it is being used in conjunction with a detailed description of certain specific embodiments of the invention. Certain terms may even be emphasized below however any terminology intended to be interpreted in any restricted manner will be overtly and specifically defined as such in this Detailed Description section.

It should be understood that the various techniques described herein may be implemented in connection with hardware or software or where appropriate with a combination of both. Thus the methods and apparatus of the disclosure or certain aspects or portions thereof may take the form of program code i.e. instructions embodied in tangible media such as floppy diskettes CD ROMs hard drives or any other machine readable storage medium wherein when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine such as a computer the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the disclosure. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers the computing device generally includes a processor a storage medium readable by the processor including volatile and nonvolatile memory and or storage elements at least one input device and at least one output device. One or more programs that may implement or utilize the processes described in connection with the disclosure e.g. through the use of an application programming interface API reusable controls or the like. Such programs are preferably implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However the program s can be implemented in assembly or machine language if desired. In any case the language may be a compiled or interpreted language and combined with hardware implementations.

Some of the embodiments described herein describe methods and systems for flexible frequency division duplex FFDD transmission. The methods and systems may also be combined with a traditional TDD or FDD system to create a hybrid system. The multiple access technology mentioned herein can be of any special format such as Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Time Division Multiple Access TDMA Frequency Division Multiple Access FDMA Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access OFDMA Multi Carrier Code Division Multiple Access MC CDMA or Carrier Sensing Multiple Access CSMA .

Without loss of generality OFDMA is employed herein as an example to illustrate different aspects of these embodiments.

The geographic region serviced by the system may be divided into a plurality of cells and wireless coverage may be provided in each cell by a base station. One or more mobile devices may be fixed or may roam within the geographic region. The mobile devices may be used as an interface between users and the network. A base station may serve as a focal point to transmit information to and receive information from the mobile devices within the cell that it serves by radio signals. A base station may be a macro station that covers a large geographical area or a macro cell a micro or pico station that covers a small area or a micro pico cell or a femto station that typically covers an indoor area or a femtocell. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that if a cell is divided into sectors each sector can be considered as a cell. In this context the terms cell and sector are interchangeable.

The transmission from a base station to a mobile station may be called a downlink DL and the transmission from a mobile station to a base station may be called an uplink UL . The transmission may take place within a frequency range extending between two limiting frequencies. This range of frequency resource may be defined as an operating frequency band channel or simply band in this text. The center of the frequency range is typically the center frequency or carrier frequency and the span of the frequency range is normally referred to as the bandwidth. For example the frequency band for Broadcast Channel 36 in the United States is centered at 605 MHz with a bandwidth of 6 MHz. In another example a 3GPP WCDMA system may use a 5 MHz DL band and a 5 MHz UL band.

High power broadcast system covering a large area may overlap to a certain extent with the wireless communication system of multiple base stations each of which covers an area as illustrated in . The broadcast system as an example uses Band b0 for transmission and b 1 and b 1 as guard bands . These bands along with adjacent bands available DL bands can be used for DL transmission for cellular or indoor wireless communication systems. The bands available for UL transmission may be those that are not used for broadcast in the region of interest those designated for other applications rather than high power broadcast e.g. MMDS around 2.5 2.6 GHz or simply those designated for UL transmission.

In accordance with aspects of certain embodiments disclosed herein a wireless communication system may operate with a DL band chosen from a group or pool of bands designated for DL transmission and a UL band chosen from a group or pool of bands designated for UL transmission. A band in the DL pool does not necessarily have a fixed or predetermined one to one correspondence to or association with a band in the UL pool.

A control server may comprise components such as processors memory banks switches routers and interfaces. Together these components enable the server to perform functions such as compressing and decompressing packet headers removing and adding packet headers segmenting and concatenating packets and managing a database.

A receiver branch comprises an RF receiver RX component signal processor a demodulator component and a channel decoding processor. The signal processor is configured to carry out various functions such as signal conditioning ranging in a base station and synchronization in both time and frequency by a mobile station. The demodulator is configured to demodulate the received signals. The channel decoding processor is configured to carry out functions such as channel compensation de interleaving FEC decoding and derandomization.

In addition to the transmitter and receiver a controller coupled with memory is configured to control the operation of the transmitter and receiver as well as the duplexer . Both the TX and RX consist of RF components such as filters amplifiers mixers oscillators and synthesizers. These components can be adjusted to operate at different center frequencies with various bandwidths. Duplexer enables the RF duplex operation by connecting the transmitter to the antenna and antenna to the receiver while isolating the transmitter and receiver. The duplexer may consist of a plurality of filters circulators isolators couplers and switches which can be manipulated to operate at different center frequencies with various bandwidths and at a FDD mode a TDD mode or a hybrid mode i.e. FDD TDD mode . The antenna is a multi band antenna which may be of different form factors or made up of different physical antenna elements.

Multiple transmitter branches and or multiple receiver branches may be used by a base station or a mobile station in case where multiple bands arc used in the DL and or UL as illustrated in . The number of transmitter branches is not necessarily the same as that of the receiver branches. The duplexer is configured to provide connections and isolations between antenna transmitter branches and the receiver branches.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that these components construct transmit and receive a communication signal containing the data. Other forms of transmitters or receivers may of course be used depending on the requirements of the communication system.

The wireless communication system may use a radio frame structure to facilitate the DL and UL transmission. For example a radio frame may consist of multiple N subframes as shown in . In some embodiments multiple M frames may form a super frame . In other embodiments a subframe may be further divided into multiple time slots. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the division of radio frames and its granularity are to facilitate radio transmission. Other forms of division or other nomenclature may of course be used depending on the requirements of the communication system.

The same structure of the transmission frame may be used by all of the cells within the system and frames may be transmitted in synchronization among the cells. Synchronization signals and or reference signals may be embedded in each frame or subframe to assist radio operations.

A short period SP may be inserted at some point of a super frame to provide information about the super frame. In this short period may be placed at the beginning of a super frame which can be used to transmit beacon preamble header and or other types of signaling for that super frame.

If an OFDM system is used a subframe or time slot may further comprise one or more OFDM symbols. The OFDM time domain waveform may be generated by applying the inverse fast Fourier transform IFFT of the OFDM signals in the frequency domain. A basic structure of a multi carrier signal in the frequency domain may be made up of subcarriers that can be modulated to carry information data and reference signals. A copy of the last portion of the time waveform known as the cyclic prefix CP may be inserted at the beginning of the waveform itself to form an OFDM symbol.

In a frequency division duplex FDD system a frequency band may be designated for the DL transmission and a different frequency band for the UL transmission as illustrated in . Using this pair of DL UL frequency bands bidirectional communication may be carried out between a base station and a mobile station. The DL and UL bands are typically separated by a sufficient gap in frequency. Furthermore the DL and UL bands may be tied or paired together in predetermined manner in a conventional FDD system. This DL and UL band pairing or association is typically fixed and remains unchanged during operations. The pairing information is known to the base stations and mobile stations. Therefore when a mobile station detects the DL signal the mobile station can automatically determine the corresponding UL frequency band for use.

An FDD system can operate in a full duplex mode or a half duplex mode. In full duplex mode a base station or a mobile station may be configured to send and receive a transmission on both the DL and UL at the same time. In half duplex mode a base station mobile station is configured to either send on the DL UL or receive on the UL DL at any one time.

In a time division duplex TDD system a carrier frequency or band may be designated for both the DL and UL transmissions which take place alternating in time as illustrated in .

In accordance with aspects of certain embodiments of the present disclosure a flexible frequency division duplex FFDD system is provided that allows for improvements over conventional FDD or TDD systems where DL and UL association is fixed and predetermined. In embodiments of an FFDD system the DL and UL band assignment and association may be flexible and or dynamic as depicted in to carry out bidirectional communication between base stations and mobile stations. An FFDD system may allow for flexible frequency band allocation and configuration. In one embodiment an FFDD system may operate with two groups of bands the DL group of the bands designated for DL transmission and the UL group of bands designated for UL transmission . The number of bands in each group may be different and the bandwidths of the bands in each group may be different or the same. A band in the DL group may be associated with any band in the UL group. Furthermore a DL band may be associated with more than one UL band or multiple DL bands may be associated with a UL band. In one embodiment a band may be chosen from the DL band group for DL transmission and a band may be chosen from the UL band group for UL transmission to establish a communication channel with a DL link and a UL link. In some embodiments the assignment association and or pairing of the DL and UL bands may be announced by special signaling.

A group of DL bands may be designated for a cell while another group of DL bands may be designated for another cell. The DL band groups for different cells may be the same overlapping or completely different. Likewise a group of UL bands may be designated for a cell while another group of UL bands may be designated for another cell. The UL band groups for different cells may be the same overlapping or completely different.

FFDD operation typically uses DL signaling for the base stations or other signaling facilities such as TV broadcasting stations to provide mobile stations with information about corresponding UL bands or DL UL band association. FFDD operation typically uses additional functions performed in base stations or mobile stations for some radio operations such as DL UL band assignment cell search random access and handoff.

In some embodiments a DL band group used by a cell may include a subgroup of DL Primary Bands and a subgroup of DL Auxiliary Bands . A UL band group may contain a subgroup of UL Primary Bands and a subgroup of UL Auxiliary Bands . A plurality of cells or even all of the cells in a cellular network may have a common subgroup of DL or UL Primary Bands. In some embodiments different cells may have different subgroups of DL Auxiliary Bands or UL Auxiliary Bands . In one embodiment pairing of DL Primary Bands and the UL Primary Bands is relatively less flexible than the pairing of the DL Auxiliary Bands and UL Auxiliary Bands . In one embodiment the pairing of DL Primary Bands and UL Primary Bands is fixed while the pairing of DL Auxiliary Bands and UL Auxiliary Bands is flexible as depicted in and .

Certain radio operations such as the signaling of DL UL band associations may be carried out in the Primary Bands. The Primary Bands may exhibit lower frequency reuse with TV broadcasting systems or other cellular systems. Auxiliary Bands may exhibit higher frequency reuse either with TV broadcasting systems or other cellular systems.

In one embodiment the Auxiliary DL UL band pairing or association is more dynamic and cell specific while the Primary DL UL band pairing is fixed and cell common. In the example depicted in in Celli the Auxiliary DL UL band pairings are UHF bands and in Cell 2 the Auxiliary DL UL band pairings are UHF bands and and in Cell 3 the Auxiliary DL UL band pairings are UHF bands and . The Primary DL UL band pairing is common to the three cells UHF bands and . In this example UHF band may be used for Digital terrestrial mobile TV broadcasting in Celli UHF band may be used for Digital terrestrial mobile TV broadcasting in Cell 2 UHF band may be used for Digital terrestrial mobile TV broadcasting in Cell 3 and UHF band may be used for high power Digital terrestrial mobile TV broadcasting in a super cell that covers Cell 1 Cell 2 and Cell 3. The UHF bands are dedicated for use in the cellular data network. The UHF bands typically 6 or 8 MHz may be reorganized to fit with the bandwidth of 3GPP LTE systems typically 5 10 or 20 MHz and the DL and UL band groups may be redefined to carry out the operations in accordance with the embodiments of the present invention.

In some embodiments the Primary Bands may be assigned to a group of selected cells. On other embodiments the Auxiliary Bands may be used in a relatively dynamic manner. For example there may be fewer restrictions on the assignment and association of an Auxiliary Band.

In one embodiment a plurality of DL Primary Bands may be used for data unicasting while a plurality of DL Auxiliary Bands may be used for multimedia broadcasting or multicasting. These DL Auxiliary Bands may be not paired with any UL bands.

In one embodiment depicted in one band DLI is used for a first DL transmission and another band DL2 UL is used for a second DL transmission and a UL transmission. The DLI band may be used for multimedia broadcasting multicasting MBMS while the DL2 UL band may be used for DL and UL unicasting in a TDD mode. Therefore the overall system operates in a hybrid FDD TDD mode. The RFTX or RFRX in each transmitter or receiver branch may employ a filter bank that includes a plurality of filters each of which may have a specific pass band and can be activated or deactivated as needed. One or more filters may be activated to form a pass band. In this example Filter 1 Filter 2 and Filter 3 at the base station may be activated to pass the corresponding frequency bands. A time switch may be used for the TDD operation between DL2 and UL whereas a frequency duplexer may be used for the FDD operation between DL1 and DL2 UL. Similarly at the mobile station Filter 1 Filter 2 and Filter 3 may be activated to pass the corresponding frequency bands. A time switch may be used for the TDD operation and a frequency duplexer may be used for the FDD operation.

In another embodiment depicted in two DL bands DL1 and DL2 and a UL band may be used for communication in a FDD mode. Filter 1 Filter 2 and Filter 3 at the base station may be activated to pass the frequency bands corresponding to DL1 DL2 and UL. The duplexer used for the FDD operation can be realized using a frequency multiplexer employing a bank of a plurality of filters each of which has a specific pass band and can be activated or deactivated as needed. One or more filters can be activated to form a pass band. In this case three individual pass bands arc created as depicted in . The duplexer can also be implemented using two non overlapping frequency filters one low pass and the other high pass if the possible DL bands are in the lower range of the spectrum and the possible UL bands are in the higher range of the spectrum as depicted in . Similarly at the mobile station Filter 1 Filter 2 and Filter 3 may be activated to pass the frequency bands corresponding to DL1 and DL2 UL and a duplexer may be used for the FDD operation.

With the flexibility of FFDD systems the frequency reuse plan for DL may be different from the frequency reuse plan for UL. In some embodiments the reuse plan may be changed in time.

In some embodiments the cell size for DL and UL may be different as depicted in . For example a DL or UL band may be used for a larger cell by a base station and a UL or DL band may be used for a smaller cell by another base station. Thus a mobile station may be served by two different base stations one for DL transmission and the other for UL transmission. The serving base stations may be connected through a wired or wireless backbone link and exchange control information and data information via the backbone link. The control information may include radio resource request and allocation information modulation and coding information channel feedback and packet acknowledgement ACK or non acknowledgement NACK . The data information may include internet data or multimedia data such as voice or video packets.

In some embodiments a DL band may be associated with multiple UL bands. For example the DL band may be used for a large cell and the multiple UL bands may be used for multiple small cells. That is these UL bands may be used separately as in the example depicted in . If the UL bands are contiguous they can be aggregated together to form a wider UL band that is associated with a DL band as depicted in .

Similarly multiple DL bands may be associated with a UL band as depicted in . For example the DL bands may be used for multiple small cells and the UL band may be used for a large cell for UL transmission by the mobile stations in these small cells. If the DL bands are contiguous they can be aggregated together to form a wider DL band to meet the need of a specific application. For example the wider DL band may be used in a group of small cells for SFN broadcast. In this case the wider DL band may be associated with a UL band as depicted in .

If the bandwidths of a DL band and a UL band are different as in the example of an aggregated band associated with a normal band the structure of the signal on the wider band may be adapted to accommodate the wider bandwidth.

In some embodiments the subcarrier spacing in the OFDM symbol may be increased proportionally to the increase in bandwidth while keeping the number of subcarriers i.e. same FFT length unchanged thereby resulting in shorter OFDM symbols in time length. Alternatively the number of subcarriers in the OFDM symbol or the FFT length may be increased proportionally to the increase in bandwidth while keeping the subcarrier spacing and thus the symbol length unchanged.

In other embodiments to carry out multimedia content broadcast and cellular data unicast some subframes may be dedicated for SFN broadcast and others for data unicast including cell specific control channels . In such cases information on the UL band used in a cell may be provided by the base station for that cell through the unicast subframes. A subframe may not necessarily be exclusively assigned for SFN broadcast or data unicast. For instance in a subframe one or more OFDM symbols can be allocated for data unicast and the rest of OFDM symbols can be allocated for SFN broadcast. In this case information for the UL band can be provided via the unicast symbols.

In further embodiments multiple bands may be used by individual base stations. For example depicts an example in which for a group of K cells two DL bands are allocated to each cell. One DL band e.g. DL m is common to all cells in the group and may be used for multimedia content broadcast in a SFN form by this group of cells. The other DL band may be used for data unicast within a frequency reuse plan among this group of cells.

In some embodiments a UL band may be paired with multiple DL bands through different types of UL multiple access methods such as FDMA TDMA CDMA and OFDMA as depicted in . In TDMA the UL band may be divided into multiple not necessarily equal segments in time and each segment may be allocated to pair with a DL band to establish a bi directional communication link. In FDMA the UL band may be divided into multiple not necessarily equal segments in frequency and each segment may be allocated to pair with a DL band. In CDMA codes may be arranged into multiple sets and each set may be allocated to pair with a DL band. In OFDMA time frequency transmission units e.g. sub carrier blocks or subchannels may be organized into different sets and each set may be allocated to pair with a DL band. Such multiple access and sharing mechanisms may be coordinated by the control server or negotiated upon among the sharing base stations.

In some embodiments a DL signal such as a beacon may be transmitted by one or more base stations to indicate the frequency reuse plan for DL and or UL. Possible frequency reuse plans can be pre determined and tabulated in a lookup table for example. A lookup table may be made available to the base stations and mobile stations and the lookup table information may be stored by the base stations and mobile stations. A specific reuse plan may be indicated by an index in the lookup table and the index may be carried by the DL signal.

In other embodiments during DL transmission a signal or signals may be broadcast by one or more base stations to provide information about the assignment of DL and UL bands for one or more cells. The information may further indicate the pairing of a DL band and a UL band in one or more cells. The information may also indicate the pairing of multiple DL bands and UL bands in one or more cells.

In some embodiments DL UL band pairs or associations for one or more cells may be specified by centralized signaling via a DL Primary Band or in each DL band. Additionally and optionally DL UL band pairs or associations for one or more cells may be specified by centralized signaling by a cellular base station or a super station e.g. TV broadcasting tower . Alternatively the association of a DL band and its corresponding UL band in a cell may be specified by distributed signaling that is the DL signaling on that DL band may indicate its pairing UL band.

A periodic signal e.g. a preamble in the short period of a super frame or synchronization signals in a frame may be broadcast by a base station to signify the DL band that it is currently using. Such a signal may be designed to carry some distinctive characteristics to facilitate the mobile station to lock on to the DL band. This signal may also carry the information specifying the association between a DL band and a UL band or a separate signal may be used to carry the same information. The signals can be transmitted per subframe or per time slot.

The association between a DL band and a UL band can also be specified as a message embedded in a control or data subchannel preferably with some level of error protection coding. Additional information may be provided together with the DL UL paring information. In the message bit fields of different lengths may be reserved for specifying all or some of the following information entities in a specific format not necessarily in the same order 

In systems employing FDMA CDMA or OFDMA one of the following lines may be used to replace sub frame numbers or time of use for TDMA UL band sharing optional above 

The above information message may be implemented as a string of bits and can be compressed using an information compression technique. The message may also be multiplexed with other control messages into a bitmap possibly using an information compression technique. A cyclic redundancy check attachment may be added to the message before being channel coded and modulated. The modulated information symbols may be mapped to OFDM subcarriers in a control or data subchannel in a header or in a preamble for transmission.

Possible DL UL band associations may be anticipated and tabulated in a lookup table such as the one shown below which may be made available to both the base stations and mobile stations for local storage. For example a control server may distribute the table via a backbone network to base stations and the base stations may forward the table to mobile stations on a broadcast or control subchannel. A particular association may be specified by an index in the lookup table which corresponds to a particular DL band within the DL band set and a particular DL band within the UL band set.

In some embodiments a DL preamble mid amble or post amble in a frame or super frame may be used to specify one or more random access channels in an aggregated UL band or shared UL band. A DL header of a frame or DL message in a control or data channel may be used to indicate sub channel assignments in a UL band especially in an aggregated UL band or shared UL band.

In other embodiments a base station may periodically broadcast advertisement messages to provide mobile stations hand off information including information regarding DL and or UL bands in neighboring cells. For example the advertisement message may include pairing information of a DL band and the corresponding UL band or pairing information of DL bands and corresponding UL bands in one or more neighboring cells. A mobile station may use the advertisement message to identify the DL and UL frequency band pairs in the neighboring cells and to expedite the hand off process.

A group of DL bands and a group of UL bands may be made available by designating these bands for a system to use in a specific geographical region. The availability of DL bands and UL bands in specific geographical region may also be indicated by an information database.

In some embodiments a central processor e.g. a control server may assign an available DL band to a base station as well as the corresponding UL band. Alternatively individual base stations may independently determine which available DL bands along with the associated UL bands to use. The individual base stations may make this determination by for example negotiation among themselves or self organization methodologies.

When determining which available DL and UL bands to be assigned to a base station in a cell the central processor or the controller in a base station may take into account one or more of the following factors 

Some of the above information may be obtained through cell survey and cell planning before or during the build out and operation of a cellular network and may be provided to a control server and one or more base stations.

In some embodiments the processor may process jointly or independently the information related to these factors to determine which DL and UL bands are to be used by the base station. For example the processor may pair up the DL and UL bands with a similar interference level for similar types of DL and UL data traffic. In some cases where the DL signals are relatively robust e.g. in a SFN broadcast application UL interference level may be a primary factor for choosing a UL band.

In other embodiments an imbalance in the interference level between the DL and UL bands may be compensated for by using different MCS and or transmission power control for the DL and UL transmission.

To determine the interference level on a UL band a base station may detect interfering signals in the time or frequency domain and evaluate the average interference level or an equivalent noise level.

To determine the interference level on a DL band the base station may aggregate the interference information fed back from the mobile stations under its service coverage and to obtain an average interference level or an equivalent noise level.

A base station may share or exchange its interference information via a wire or wireless medium with other base stations especially with those base stations of its neighboring cells. The base station may also send the interference information to the control server. The control server may establish a database or record of interference for each DL and UL band based on the information sent from each base station. Such a database can be used as a basis for DL UL band assignment.

A mobile station may assess the interference it experiences from other transmitters on a DL band used by the mobile station. The mobile station may determine the DL interference level by detecting the interfering signal in the time or frequency domain and transmit the interference information to its DL serving base station.

In a cellular wireless communication system a cell search procedure may be used by a mobile station to acquire time and frequency synchronization within a cell and detect the cell identity. In the FFDD system the cell search procedure may be coupled with functions such as searching for the DL band for a cell and obtaining the information on the pairing UL band.

In some embodiments a cell search procedure may comprise a DL band search and acquisition of UL system information as depicted in . In the DL band search a mobile station may scan for the signature of a synchronization signal over potential DL bands and lock onto the DL band according to design criteria such as high signal power level high signal to interference noise ratio SINR low traffic load or large available capacity or a combination thereof. In acquisition of UL system information a mobile station may process the DL preambles or messages to extract the UL system information such as the corresponding UL band assignment and random access channel configuration.

Referring to in the cell search operation for network entry a mobile station may be configured to search a DL frequency band by scanning for the signature of a DL synchronization signal over potential DL bands. Once the mobile station finds the DL synchronization signal the mobile station may be configured to carry out time and frequency synchronization based on the DL signal. The mobile station may further be configured to determine the cell identity and acquire DL system information by processing the DL preambles or messages. The mobile station may also be configured to process the DL preambles or messages to extract the UL system information including the DL UL association information.

n a cellular wireless communication system a handoff procedure may be used by a mobile station to transfer an ongoing connection session from a serving cell to a target cell. In an FFDD system the handoff procedure may further involve obtaining DL band and corresponding UL band assignment for the neighboring cells. A mobile station may obtain the band assignment pairing information by receiving the advertisement message broadcast in the serving cell or by directly scanning the DL bands used by neighboring cells and obtaining the information on the DL and corresponding UL band assignment of the target cell.

In some embodiments a handoff procedure may comprise steps as shown in . To prepare for handoff a mobile station may periodically scan neighboring cells. During the course of acquisition of neighboring cell information a mobile station may receive neighbor advertisement messages providing proper handoff information. This information may reduce unnecessary overhead for scanning. Subsequently the mobile station may scan neighboring cells and measure signal qualities which can be used for determining whether to proceed with handoff. If a handoff decision is made the mobile station may perform functions such as time and frequency synchronization cell identity detection and UL band information acquisition with respect to the target base station. Subsequently the mobile station may establish a link with the target base station and then terminate service with the original base station.

Referring to in the handoff operation a mobile station may be configured to acquire system information about its neighboring cells by periodically scanning signals from neighboring cells or by receiving neighbor advertisement messages about the neighboring cells from its serving cell. Subsequently the mobile station may be configured to scan neighboring cells and measure the corresponding signal qualities for the handoff decision making. When a handoff decision is made the mobile station may be configured to perform the network entry operation with respect to the target cell by carrying out time and frequency synchronization determining the target cell identity acquiring DL system information of the target cell by processing the DL preambles or messages and acquiring UL system information of the target cell by processing the DL preambles or messages. The mobile station may be configured to establish a link with the target base station and terminate service with the original base station.

In some embodiments spatial processing methods may be used to facilitate or enhance radio link performance. Spatial processing methods may include spatial multiplexing spatial diversity space time or frequency coding beamforming and techniques that exploit the characteristics of multiple antennas with different space displacements or polarizations. For example spatial processing techniques can be used to balance the so called link budget for DL and UL due to different transmission characteristics at two different frequencies e.g. DL at UHF and UL at MMDS . As another example an appropriate spatial processing technique e.g. space multiplexing combined with space time coding may be implemented on the DL in a UHF band to increase data rates and link robustness while in the UL on a MMDS band a base station may use beamforming to improve signal reception.
