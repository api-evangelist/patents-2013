The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.

The present invention relates to the field of ground sensors and it more particularly relates to a ground surface reconnaissance projectile which is aerially deployable to a target location.

Reconnaissance projectiles including unattended ground sensors UGS have been developed for military use to satisfy the persistent need for reconnaissance particularly in war situations. An exemplary need is for the prolonged deployment of the reconnaissance projectiles while maintaining the survivability of the electronic components and sensors housed within the reconnaissance projectiles.

As used herein a reconnaissance projectile is an unmanned monitoring platform that is often used for various military activities such as terrain surveillance troop movement and target identification. The reconnaissance projectile can include a plurality of sensors. The reconnaissance projectile transmits the acquired sensor data wirelessly to a remote unit for analysis and use in field operations.

While numerous types of reconnaissance devices have been proposed their main function is the general aerial reconnaissance over a target area. These reconnaissance devices may in certain instances be delivered to the target location by hand placement or by aerial deployment. Such delivery methods while efficient for larger reconnaissance devices may prove to be not feasible or inordinately costly and inaccurate to certain extent particularly for distributing smaller reconnaissance devices over the target location within an enemy territory or over a terrain that may be too difficult to reach by foot such as in a mountainous region.

Higher accuracy in the placement of the reconnaissance devices is desirable to provide accurate peripheral surveillance of the target location.

There is therefore a need for a ground surface reconnaissance projectile which is completely inert with an electronics package configuration that is designed to survive the gun launch and impact induced forces while being able to persistently relay reconnaissance data over a long range for an extended period of time after landing. The need for such a reconnaissance projectile has heretofore remained unsatisfied.

The present invention addresses the concerns of the conventional ground reconnaissance devices and presents a new remotely static reconnaissance projectile capable of performing ground level Intelligence reconnaissance and surveillance ISR after the projectile has landed for an extended period of time such as several days or longer.

The reconnaissance projectile has a wide array of sensor types and imaging systems and can robustly classify targets of interest automatically. The present reconnaissance projectile is comparable to hand placed high values UGS with the significant tactical improvement of remote placement.

According to a preferred embodiment the present reconnaissance projectile is a 60 mm mortar ground surface reconnaissance projectile which is completely inert with electronics package configuration designed to survive the gun launch and impact induced forces while being able to relay reconnaissance data from a long range.

To this end the present reconnaissance projectile includes a plurality of interconnected sections a tail boom a rear body a main body four leg hinge assemblies and a nose cone or nose .

The rear body houses a parachute that is deployed in flight to slow the projectile. After landing the parachute is released and leg hinge assemblies are deployed to cause the projectile to uprights itself on four legs thereby exposing a plurality of sensors and an antenna for communicating the collected data to an operator at a remote location.

Similar numerals refer to similar elements in the drawings. It should be understood that the sizes of the different components in the figures are not necessarily in exact proportion or to scale and are shown for visual clarity and for the purpose of explanation.

With reference to the present invention provides a ground reconnaissance device such as a reconnaissance projectile that is capable of performing ground level Intelligence reconnaissance and surveillance ISR for an extended period of time after the projectile has landed. The projectile generally includes a plurality of interconnected sections a fail boom a rear body a main body four leg hinge assemblies and a nose cone .

The tail boom generally includes a plurality of fins as is known in the field. As a result the tail boom will not be described in greater detail. Similarly the nose cone is known in the field and will not be described herein in detail. The outer shape of the nose cone is selected to maintain standard aerodynamic properties.

According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the projectile is a 60 mm custom inert mortar projectile whose rear body houses a parachute that will be described later in greater detail in connection with . The parachute is deployed in flight to slow the projectile in order to land softly and to prevent burial in soft terrain.

A bearing assembly forms part of the rear body and is used to allow the main body of the projectile to rotate freely relative to the parachute . Such free rotation will ensure that the parachute cords does not become entangled.

As the projectile descends the parachute drags the projectile into a soft landing. After landing the parachute is released and the leg hinge assemblies are deployed. The projectile uprights itself on four legs of the respective leg hinge assemblies exposing a plurality of sensors and an antenna for communicating the collected data to an operator at a remote location. Numerous different sensors can be used including but not limited to optical and acoustic sensors.

Having summarily described the general operation of the projectile the design and operation of the projectile will now be described in more detail.

With further reference to B A B is a cross sectional view of the projectile taken along line A A of . The four leg hinge assemblies are generally similar in construction function and design and are uniformly spaced along the periphery of the main body .

With further reference to the parachute is tethered by cords to the bearing assembly by means of for example pins but the tethering could alternatively be accomplished by a variety of other methods that are available or known. The bearing assembly is used to allow a mortar body of the main body to rotate freely with respect to the parachute . This is done to ensure that the parachute cords do not become entangled.

The parachute is automatically deployed through an actuation mechanism that comprises the lead screw the axial piston the hollow shaft a rear set of ball detents a front set of ball detents a tail boom adapter a bearing inner race the rear spring and the front spring . The actuation mechanism is powered by the electric motor A B . The electric motor forms part of the main body and is connected to a lead screw that extends and translates axially through the main body .

The shaft of the motor is pinned to the lead screw . In turn the lead screw is threaded inside of an axial piston that extends and translates axially and linearly within a hollow shaft of the rear body as the lead screw is caused to rotate by the motor . According to another embodiment the shaft of the motor can act as a lead screw which could be achieved by having a threading motor shaft.

This linear motion of the axial piston is achieved by pressing a pin through the piston and the hollow shaft that houses the piston . The pin acts to prevent any rotational motion of the piston . As the lead screw rotates and because the piston rotation is restrained the lead screw is forced to translate axially within the hollow shaft . The pin serves multiple functions during gun launch.

As illustrated in during gun launch the pin is seated against the bottom of a slot of the hollow shaft and supports the inertial load of the piston to prevent the inertial load from being carried by the motor shaft. This state is referred to herein as State . 

As illustrated in during flight and landing as the actuation mechanism is initiated the pin serves as a mechanical stop for the piston and limits its travel until the pin is bottomed on the front side of the slot of the hollow shaft . This state is referred to herein as State . As the projectile lands the pin serves as a stop and carries the initial loading of the landing impact so that the load resulting from the impact is not transmitted through the motor shaft in order to prevent damage to the motor .

In the assembled state the rear body is spring loaded by means of a rear spring and is locked into position via a rear set of ball detents that includes for example three detents. The detents are located on the end of the piston that is adjacent to the tail boom . Sealing is provided to prevent damage resulting from high pressure gases and weather conditions. While not shown in the drawings sealing can be achieved by a plurality of C rings to prevent high pressure gases from entering the projectile rear body and main body .

The sequence of operation of the projectile will now be described in more detail in connection with . illustrates the projectile during the initial stage of the flight after firing but prior to activation. The parachute is shown in a stowed position.

At a desired or predetermined altitude of the flight a control circuitry that is housed within the nose cone includes various electronic packages such as a transmitter special sensors timing circuits and other circuitries. The control circuitry sends an electronic control signal to the motor in order to actuate the actuation mechanism . As illustrated in when the motor turns the lead screw in the clockwise direction the piston is translated forward relative to the mortar body in the direction of the arrow L until it bottoms against the front of the slot of the hollow shaft as described earlier.

At this stage the motor is electronically shut off and the rear set of ball detents are pushed radially inward inside the hollow shaft within the rear body by means of the rear spring . In the above referenced State the spring loaded rear body is held in position by the rear set of ball detents . The tail boom adapter has a tapered surface that contacts the ball detents . The ball detents are captured between the tail boom adapter and the piston to prevent the rear body from being ejected under the action of the rear spring .

When the piston moves in the direction of the arrow L the ball detents become free to fall into the hollow shaft . As the piston moves forward it exposes a reduced diameter section of the piston to the ball detents such that the ball detents are captured between the tail boom adapter and the piston to prevent the rear body from being ejected under the action of the rear spring .

As shown in the detents are then forced into the hollow shaft until they bottom against the reduced diameter section of the piston . The detents are pushed in far enough until they no longer capture the tail boom adapter which enables the rear body to be ejected.

Concurrently as the piston translates in the direction of the arrow L the front set of ball detents get pushed radially outward through the hollow shaft and gets captured between the bearing inner race and the piston . Because the ball detents are captured the bearing assembly is secured to the main body . The ball detents retain the bearing assembly which is also preloaded with the front spring .

Once in the aforementioned State the tail boom under the action of the preloaded rear spring is jettisoned as shown in in the direction of the arrow M causing the parachute to be fully deployed. shows the parachute in a fully deployed state.

With reference to after the mortar body has softly landed at the target location an on board accelerometer sensing no acceleration change causes the control circuitry to send a control signal to the motor instructing the motor to turn in the counter clockwise direction. The counter clockwise rotation of the motor causes the piston to translate axially rearwardly relative to the mortar body in the direction of the arrow N . Concurrently as the piston translates in the direction of the arrow N the front set of ball detents gets pushed radially inward through the hollow shaft due to the spring force of spring . and gets captured between the inner bearing race and the piston .

With further reference to the relocation of the front set of ball detents causes the front spring to act on the bearing assembly and jettisons it in the direction of the arrow P until it clears the hollow shaft completely. The leg locking disc includes a recess that engages the four respective feet of the legs for retaining the legs in a locked position as shown for example in . Concurrently with the ejection of the bearing assembly the leg locking disc which is a part of the bearing assembly is also ejected thereby leaving the four legs free to deploy outwardly along the arrow Q .

More specifically while the leg locking disc is engaged to the legs it is spring loaded by means of a front spring . As a result of the relocation of the front set of ball detents the disengagement of the legs from the leg locking disc causes the front spring to force jettison the leg locking disc the rear spring and the parachute along the arrow P along the shaft .

Consequently and as further illustrated in the leg locking disc the rear spring and the parachute are then detached from the mortar body and the four spring loaded legs are forced to open and to upright the mortar body on the ground as illustrated in . To this end each leg such as leg is provided with a leg spring such as leg spring which is designed to provide sufficient torque to force the corresponding leg to open and further to upright the mortar body as well as to support the weight of the mortar body in the upright position.

As explained earlier in connection with each leg hinge assembly i.e. is provided with a foam damper i.e. . Each foam damper i.e. surrounds a corresponding leg hinge to provide a smooth righting motion.

At this stage the mortar sensors and electronic equipment module is turned on to remotely relay the reconnaissance data back to an operator. As illustrated in the data transmission is achieved by means of an antenna . The ejection of the leg locking disc exposes the antenna .

The antenna is connected to the sensors electronic equipment module by means of a connector . The sensor electronic equipment module includes various sensors as demanded by the specific applications of the projectile as well as several cameras lenses B .

The camera lenses are preferably located around the periphery of the mortar body at approximately 45 degrees from each other and 45 degrees relative to the legs to create a 360 degree view around the mortar body .

One or more additional microphones or sensors may be placed in the antenna cavity of the support disc cavity of the antenna .

The other electronic components of the projectile may be located within the mortar body and may include for example 4 PCB boards . All the PCB boards may be placed vertically inside the mortar body along the axial direction of the projectile . The PCB boards may be supported in the transverse up and down direction can be mounted in a variety of configurations. The sensors the electronic boards and components and the power supply i.e. batteries are located inside the mortar body .

It should be understood that other modifications might be made to the present design without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
