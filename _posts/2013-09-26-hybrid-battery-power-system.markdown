Battery chemistry is extremely important in determining how long and under which load conditions battery powered systems can operate. Common primary battery chemistries include but are not limited to zinc manganese dioxide i.e. alkaline zinc carbon primary lithium biological seawater and thermal. Common secondary battery chemistries include but are not limited to nickel metal hydride nickel cadmium silver zinc nickel zinc lithium ion and lead acid. For example ubiquitous alkaline cells can provide a considerable amount of electrical energy if discharged very slowly over an extended period of time i.e. at a low discharge rates. However the available capacity of an alkaline cell is reduced significantly as the discharge rate increases. For example a commercial alkaline D size cell e.g. a battery with zinc manganese dioxide chemistry can supply approximately 20 ampere hours AH at a constant current load of 50 milliamperes mA . The capacity of the same alkaline D size cell is reduced to only 4 AH at a load of 1000 mA i.e. at higher current the cell capacity is reduced to only 20 of its capacity at low current . Accordingly alkaline cell chemistry can efficiently supply energy to battery operated systems over long time periods only when the system to be powered requires relatively low and constant current. This condition is highly restrictive because many operational and proposed systems also include the requirement for intermittent high power demands.

Existing methods may drive the load directly from an alkaline battery or interpose a switching voltage regulator between the battery and the load in order to mitigate the varying voltage output of alkaline cell chemistry over loading and state of charge. When there is an intermittent relatively high power load demand placed on the alkaline cell the internal resistance of the alkaline cell increases with duration causing the battery terminal voltage to drop to an unsatisfactory level even when only a relatively small fraction of the gross chemical energy has actually been extracted from the battery. The output voltage fluctuation resulting from the relatively high internal resistance of the alkaline cell makes alkaline cells unattractive for sourcing high currents even when a heavy load is only applied intermittently. In addition when the load is driven directly from the battery the voltage of the battery varies over a wide range as a function of the instantaneous load as well as the charge extracted previously. The open circuit voltage of an alkaline cell varies considerably over the discharge profile of the cell starting out at 1.55 volts when the cell is new and dropping to approximately 0.8 volts at end of life . The variable voltage problem may be eliminated by interposing a switching voltage regulator between the battery and the load. However after the open circuit voltage of the battery begins to drop and its output impedance increases as more charge is extracted over time the voltage regulator demands more current in order to maintain a constant output voltage. This creates an unstable and inefficient condition where a large percentage of the energy extracted from the battery is internally dissipated by the internal resistance of the battery itself leading to a substantial loss of net energy capacity due to voltage collapse of the partially depleted alkaline battery as charge is extracted.

With these characteristics when an alkaline battery reaches a partial discharge state where it no longer can supply intermittent high power load requirements there still remains a significant amount of chemical energy i.e. wasted energy in the dead battery which cannot be utilized in practice. Thus both of the existing methods require significant oversizing of the battery whenever a high power intermittent load is to be driven. In other words because a considerable percentage of the gross energy within the battery may be unavailable to drive the load due to the internal resistance of the battery the net energy of the battery that remains available to drive the load is greatly reduced. To account for this a system designer must incorporate a significant amount of excess battery capacity into the battery design leading to an undesirable physically larger and heavier battery particularly when the peak load current which must be supplied is high and intermittent in nature.

A primary lithium cell for example a battery utilizing lithium thionyl chloride chemistry has even higher energy density than an alkaline cell can satisfy intermittent high power load demands better than an alkaline cell can provide relatively better voltage regulation than the alkaline cell can provide reduced internal resistance compared with an alkaline cell has better shelf life than the alkaline cell and may be used at lower operating temperatures than the alkaline cell. However because of the explosive nature of lithium cells this chemistry cannot be used in certain applications because of the hazard they present.

A nickel metal hydride NiMH battery can satisfy intermittent high power load demands better than either an alkaline or a primary lithium cell can provide relatively better voltage regulation than either an alkaline cell or a lithium cell and can provide relatively lower internal resistance than either an alkaline cell or a lithium cell. However the NiMH battery has significantly lower energy density than either an alkaline cell or a lithium cell and has a higher self discharge rate than either an alkaline cell or a lithium cell. Accordingly no single battery chemistry can be used to efficiently supply a battery operated system over long periods of time when the system requires modest average power high total energy high intermittent peak power and safe operation.

Accordingly there is a need for hybrid battery power system that is configured to maximize the advantages of different battery chemistries given specific system requirements.

Some embodiments are directed to a hybrid battery configured to power at least one of a low current circuitry and a high current circuitry. The hybrid battery includes a primary battery configured to supply relatively constant low current to the low current circuitry and a secondary battery configured to supply intermittent high peak current to the high current circuitry. The hybrid battery also includes a controller configured to monitor energy load requirements of the low current circuitry and the high current circuitry adaptively direct energy generated by the primary battery and the secondary battery to the low current circuitry and the high current circuitry respectively and maintain a state of charge of the secondary battery by directing electrical energy from the primary battery to the secondary battery.

Other objects advantages and features will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanied drawings.

Skilled artisans will appreciate that elements in the figures are illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For example the dimensions of some of the elements in the figures may be exaggerated relative to other elements to help to improve understanding of embodiments of the present invention.

The apparatus and method components have been represented where appropriate by conventional symbols in the drawings showing only those specific details that are pertinent to understanding the embodiments of the present invention so as not to obscure the disclosure with details that will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the description herein.

Secondary battery may be configured to supply intermittent high peak current at relatively constant voltage to a high current circuitry. Secondary battery may be for example a set of series connected strings of rechargeable AA low self discharge nickel metal hydride NiMH cells. The diodes shown known as steering diodes may be inserted into each string of primary battery and each string of secondary battery to isolate those strings with failed cells making system failure tolerant.

Controller is an energy management system configured to monitor energy load requirements and adaptively direct energy generated by primary battery and secondary battery to the appropriate loads. Controller directs energy between loads by continuously directing low relatively constant current from primary battery to low power loads and by directing intermittent high current from secondary battery to intermittent high power loads ensuring that each of primary battery and secondary battery operates at an efficient rate. In addition controller is configured to efficiently meter electrical energy via pulse charging from primary battery into secondary battery in order to maintain a proper charge state at secondary battery . As used herein the terms relatively constant and intermittent in reference to current are in comparison to each other in the sense that current drawn from the primary battery will be of longer duration than current drawn from the secondary battery.

Controller is configured to measure the voltage on primary battery and secondary battery to determine the state of charge of each of primary battery and secondary battery . When the voltage on secondary battery falls below a first predefined threshold for example below 20 controller directs a switching charge pump to begin charging secondary battery by directing electrical energy from primary battery to secondary battery . On the other end when the voltage on secondary battery rises above a second predefined threshold for example above 80 controller directs switching charge pump to stop charging secondary battery by blocking electrical energy from primary battery to secondary battery . Controller also monitors the voltage on primary battery to determine how much energy is left on primary battery . Therefore controller is configured to automatically adapt to the dynamic demands imposed by both low and high current circuitry without under charging or over charging secondary battery .

Controller may incorporate a programmable embedded microprocessor such as a BASIC Stamp Model BS 2 interfaced to a Maxim LTC1298 dual channel 12 bit micro power analog to digital converter ADC for sensing battery voltages to necessarily permit controlling the on off state of high side switch . Microprocessor is configured to execute a smart charging algorithm for determining when electrical energy should be transferred from the primary battery to the secondary battery for the purpose of replacing the energy which was extracted by high power intermittent loads. In some embodiments the controller requires an average current of only 50 70 micro amperes for operating microprocessor and ADC . Considering the low current requirements of the controller the overall net efficiency of the hybrid battery including primary battery and the secondary battery is between 80 85 . That is 80 85 of the gross energy available from the alkaline battery at low discharge rate can be transferred to the NiMH battery where it can be extracted at high rates.

Microprocessor may also execute a low duty cycle pulse charging algorithm to obtain maximum electrical efficiency by minimizing the Tafel voltage of the secondary battery during the charging cycle. An unconditionally stable feed forward algorithm running on microprocessor automatically adapts to the high intermittent loads demands and transfers electrical energy from the primary battery into the secondary battery only when it is necessary to do so. Alternatively a negative feedback based algorithm could be employed although stability considerations must be taken into account for all source and load conditions when using a feedback controller. Controller may be programmable via a serial data port

Accordingly the charging circuit draws electrical current at a low and fairly constant average rate from the primary battery whose terminal voltage varies considerable over time as a function of the charge remaining. The energy extracted from primary battery is used to charge secondary battery which exhibits relatively constant output voltage and low series output resistance over a wide range of state of charge. The secondary battery is configured to efficiently supply high peak currents to the load in many cases eliminating the requirement for voltage regulators and further increasing the overall efficiency of system . Controller adaptively meters energy extracted from the primary battery to the secondary battery at a controlled rate such that the secondary battery voltage remains relatively constant for example 1 5 over the entire service lifetime of system i.e. over the 2 1 output voltage range of the primary battery .

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
