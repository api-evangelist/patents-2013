The invention described herein may be manufactured used and or licensed by or for the United States Government.

The embodiments herein generally relate to chemical detection technology and more particularly to chemical imaging of suspect chemically contaminated surfaces and standoff detection of subject chemical contaminants.

A variety of systems and methods have been developed and used to detect and identify hazardous chemical and biological threat agents in the field. Chemical test kits that employ chemically reactive vapor samplers and detection papers have long been used to detect chemical nerve agents blood agents and blister agents. While chemical kits are generally useful they are designed to detect a limited range of conventional chemical agents that are toxic in the range of 10g person provide no standoff protection and may be prone to false negative and positive detections.

Systems that employ Ion Mobility Spectrometry IMS in which molecules are ionized and separated according to their differences in velocities through a gas in the presence of an electric field can in theory identify and detect a wide variety of chemical and biological warfare CBW agents. IMS systems however require direct exposure to the chemical agent and the instruments typically have insufficient resolving power to identify CBW agents before they have reached casualty producing levels.

Other systems employ passive infrared PIR imaging to detect airborne chemical threats such as nerve GA GB and GD and blister H and L agents based on the infrared spectrum of the agent. Currently fielded devices have been reported to detect aerosols at a distance of up to 5 km. Practical PIR detection systems have difficulty detecting low levels of CBW surface target contaminants because the surfaces are typically at thermal equilibrium and provide insufficient contrast to identify target contaminants. Additionally background radiation and interference encountered in the field can also make detection difficult.

These and other aspects of the embodiments herein will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the following descriptions while indicating preferred embodiments and numerous specific details thereof are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the embodiments herein without departing from the spirit thereof and the embodiments herein include all such modifications.

The embodiments herein and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. Descriptions of well known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments herein. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments herein may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the embodiments herein. Accordingly the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments herein.

The embodiments herein provide a pseudo active chemical imaging sensor including irradiative transient heating temperature nonequilibrium thermal luminescence spectroscopy differential hyperspectral imaging and artificial neural network technologies integrated together. Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to through where similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the figures there are shown preferred embodiments.

As mentioned it would be advantageous to develop a sensor applied specifically to the various scenarios of interest described. The embodiments herein provide a sensor and technique to address this need. The development of the sensor provided by the embodiments herein initially involves conducting a phenomenological study of the CWA s atmospheric and or surface environments the mechanisms of analyte mass transportation and the principles of analyte mass detection i.e. light matter interactions. This involves using a panoramic imaging spectroradiometer PANSPEC system more specifically a middle infrared MIR PANSPEC chemical cloud imaging model PCCM which is further described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 708 503 and 7 038 789 the complete disclosures of which in their entireties are herein incorporated by reference. Various aspects of the PCCM and its concept of use are set forth as follows.

The PCCM prescribes collecting ambient MIR radiance stared at over its panoramic field of view PFOV object space consisting of the open atmosphere collimating that radiance into a tight beam sent through an ultrahigh speed UHS no moving parts solid state interferometer and imaging the interferometer exitance beam onto an image space occupied by a focal plane array FPA of n n HgCdTe detector elements. Streaming ninterferogram voltage waveforms output by the FPA are digitized via high speed electronics and converted into MIR spectral frames which are subsequently mined for MIR molecular vibration vibration rotation resonance bands whose structure frequencies and amplitudes of bands correlate to the subject analyte mass cloud s toxic chemical vapor aerosol constituents one to one. Expert artificial neural network ANN pattern recognition algorithms perform the spectral mining task.

The ANN recognizes signature molecular vibration vibration rotation bands of the analyte alternating between negative and positive parity amplitudes in difference spectra where parity is in reference to the baseline of difference spectrum measurements. Negative parity of spectral bands represent MIR radiance passed through the absorbing cloud and stimulating the analytes molecular vibration vibration rotation states and positive parity of spectral bands represent those excited molecules returned to lower energy levels vis vis Kirchoff s radiation law good absorbers are good infrared emitters. Amplitudes of the molecular resonance bands change in relation to capacity of the analyte to gain heat via absorption of background solar radiance and lose heat by MIR emissions. Moreover frequencies energies of molecular resonance bands are invariant as long as there is no dissociation amongst the molecular analytes due to photofragmentation and or chemical reactions. This facilitates the ANN algorithm locking into consistent detection metrics.

The UHS solid state interferometer of the PCCM incorporates front and back linear polarizer optics sandwiching three nearly identical stress birefringence single window photoelastic modulators PEMs generating transient hyperspectral images in the following context. First a beam of radiance collected then collimated from the PCCM panorama iPFOV beam is incident to the interferometer. The iPFOV beam in its ambient random polarization state transforms to a linear polarization state lpPFOV beam on transmission through the front linear polarizer optic. Second the polarization axis of the lpPFOV beam is oriented precisely 45 to the birefringence optical axis of the first birefringence ZnSe window element of the interferometer. Third all three ZnSe window PEM elements of the interferometer with bonded with piezoelectric transductions PZTs are cyclically compressed relaxed at their natural mechanical resonance frequency 30 kHz UHS designation thereby transforming the lpPFOV beam entering the 3 PEM crystals array into a polarization modulation beam exiting that array pmPFOV beam . Fourth the pmPFOV beam transforms into an intensity modulation beam imPFOV beam upon transmission through the back linear polarizer optic of the interferometer. Filth a refractive lens elements group images the imPFOV beam onto the FPA the latter matched in size to panorama of PCCM. Sixth electronic preamplification then digitization operators act simultaneously on nvoltage waveform outputs from the FPA these waveforms were previously called interferograms produced at the rate of 4 2 if the zero retardation points of ZnSe PEM retarders double in retardation amplitude . Seventh the latter streaming interferogram data strings are algorithmically time stamped grouped co added in groups of tens to hundreds producing sufficient signal to noise ratio averaged and fast Fourier transformed into running MIR spectra S . Eighth contiguous Sare subtracted and cast into data set dS S S r 2 3 . . . s where Sis the final spectrum measured over the end PZT runtime period of the interferometer. Ninth the family of curves in dS transforms into a differential hyperspectral imaging map DHIM 

Filtered is preprocessed formatted multiplexed in affined slices of dS t i j and then feed forwarded through an ANN whose architecture accommodates the DHIM data structure. The former preprocessing algorithms comprise linear baseline correction negative to positive spectra parity conversion normalization and data formatting operators. The latter ANN processor is a supervised learning backward error propagation back prop pattern recognition operator trained tested and validated against the spectrum detection metrics of known analyte s which is further described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 631 469 the complete disclosure of which in its entirety is herein incorporated by reference.

Chemical imaging spectroscopy and analyte standoff detection are functions performed by the PCCM in which positive detection ANN events from step 3 are superimposed on the DHIM from steps 1 2.

Conventional vapor aerosol standoff detection modeling efforts may be applicable to the surface contamination problem of chemical defense interest namely standoff surveillance of chemically contaminated terrain CCT in the battlefield. This tactical field scenario typically presents itself as a final fate of launched then detonated CWA ordinance whose payload comprises incapacitating and ultimately lethal nerve agent compounds such as VX in the organophosphonothiolate class and blister agent compounds such as Lewisite in the organoarsenic class their derivatives molecular group substitutions and thickened CWAs of such. On detonation of an ordinance shell its liquid payload disperses as a remnant CWA rain large sized droplets that settle on land below the detonation locus and as a remnant CWA aerosol cloud lesser sized droplets that are transported by air currents to settle on a downwind surface area swath. Powdered and aerosolized biological warfare agent ordinance payloads present similar if not more potent threats.

The embodiments herein provide a PANSPEC surface contamination model PSCSM that overcomes the problems described above using for example coupled temperature nonequilibrium phenomena and thermal luminescence TL spectroscopy including technologies described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 241 179 6 464 392 and 7 262 414 the complete disclosures of which in their entireties are herein incorporated by reference. PSCSM and PCCM are similar with the former encompassing several enhancements and additions including a virtual stack phased array VSPA interferometer for producing high resolution DHIMs in very short timeframes milliseconds a directed laser transmitter for rapidly pumping TL fluxes from suspect CCT a modified MIR imager re optimized for clear demagnified imagery an unsupervised self organization map SOM pattern recognition and clustering algorithm for deciding on presence absence of the CWA surface contaminants and other modifications.

The unsupervised SOM ANN implements reinforcement competitive learning via a topology preserving nonlinear clustering map algorithm that passes DHIM data steps 1 and 2 from its input space of linear nodes also called processing elements or neurons onto its output space of latticed nodes. Locations of the neurons so tuned on the discretized output space lattice are winning neurons they form the topological map. In accordance with the embodiments herein the algorithm adjusts weights as distances computed between exemplars in a 208 D linear input space representing 208 coordinates of dS of 2 cmresolution to codebook vectors organized in a 2 D discretized output space where clustering of the CWA surface contaminant analyte is most readily visualized and interpreted steps 3 and 4 . The ability to cluster is a manifestation of the molecular vibration resonance moieties identification cues of analyte inherited in dS measurements steps 2 3 . The molecular species of CWAs possessing strong fingerprint spectra that are unknown or unavailable such as derivative CWA compounds that may have equal or greater toxicity then their parent are subject to clustering. Clustering is the sole requirement of CWA standoff detection an extraordinary capability for detecting both known and unknown analytes.

Irradiative transient heating ITH is the transfer of energy to and from a body by means of absorption and emission of electromagnetic radiation. ITH conveys TL fluxes generated acquired and analyzed accordingly boost the suspect CCT into temperature nonequilibrium via irradiation from for instance a 0.102 eV photon energy also 826 cmspectroscopy units and 12.1 m wavelength units COlaser beam iPM beam interferometrically process the concomitant CCT to ambient TL flux radiance step 1 above transform these data into a hyperspectral data cube steps 2 3 above and mine for the subject analytes signature molecular vibration vibration rotation bands step 4 above .

The Gaussian iPM beam heating source exhibits strong absorption cross section defined as the ratio of the amount of field energy removed from the iPM beam into the CCT material to the beam s total incident energy 826 cm. Here lies just outside the 833.3 1250.0 cmbandwidth of spectroradiometer measuring TL fluxes thus identifying TLS standoff detection technology as pseudo active. If the iPM beam energy were tuned inside 833.3 1250.0 cm cm then a blinding scattered beam radiance corona flushes the weak molecular absorptive emissive resonance bands spectral features carried in the liberated TL fluxes. Moreover the iPM beam is preferably polarization modulated since absorption cross section is slightly polarization P and polarization modulation dot over P dependent. This phenomenon was observed in experiments where iPM beam irradiated CCT at dot over P 32 kHz in comparison to dot over P 0 fixed linear polarization laser beam boosts TL flux radiance by approximately 5 which is further described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 241 179 the complete disclosure of which in its entirety is herein incorporated by reference. That implies preferential absorption in the CCT medium by the iPM beam s swept continuum of linear elliptical circular polarization states with the desirable effect of increasing in DHIMs step 2 above . One can exploit the polarization modulated beam absorption cause and thermal luminescence fluxes TL dot over P effect relationship of ITH by sweeping at various values and discerning one or more frequencies of modulation causing TL dot over P to peak. For example one may conduct an optimization experiment whereby dS are measured step 1 above for an iPM beam of dot over P 0 constant linear or random polarization and dot over P 10 swept polarization states per s in dot over P steps of 1 kHz. Analyses of step 4 above as a function of dot over P may provide clues toward understanding the P dot over P mechanism and help establish optimum design parameters for the sensor of . Finally the iPM beam is dither stabilized in the spatial transverse electromagnetic wave mode TEM uniform disk intensity and that intensity pumps adequate TL fluxes for detection purposes yet below what would cause the CCT to char or burn 10 50 Wcmis typical for TLS standoff detection at ranges of 5 20 m respectively.

The iPM beam pumping of TL fluxes from the CCT a composite inhomogeneous dielectric medium comprising of strata and contaminant boundary layers randomly distributed stimulates a pattern of closely associated surface temperature gradients T and emissivity contrasts T evolving between the CCT s dissimilar dielectric layers. These T and T thermodynamic events rise in phase with each other upon incident iPM beam exposure continue to build then peak at some iPM beam irradiation time t when the CCT is in its most advanced thermal nonequilibrium state and decline toward a near null as the CCT returns to thermal pseudo equilibrium at elevated temperature with a small temperature oscillation. They can be tracked by a PSCSM based system measuring a family of graybody emissions spectra G T t emissivity 1 for a perfect Planck blackbody object 0 

TL radiometric spectral band signal intensities I of DMMP DIMP and SF96 can be observed at approximately the 5 parts per thousand level in reference to the broadband Restrahlen emission band intensity ICCT i.e. I I 0.005. Iis superimposed on Iover the entire temporal window of observation Iis the carrier of I however spectral bands of the analyte in Iare observable only in the short WDO timeframe. It can be concluded from these experiments that boosting by orders of magnitude is necessary for producing viable CCT standoff detection DHIMs step 4 above . Ergo a very high rate of interferogram data acquisition in interferograms per second is helpful as S N is proportional to the number of co added interferograms to the power. An interferometer operating at greater than or about the WDO timeframe has a low probability of detecting and resolving the transitioning absorption emission spectral bands of analytes in step 1 above . If is approximately in the range of half to a tenth of the WDO timeframe then the analyte s transitioning absorption emission molecular resonance bands of opposite amplitudes can average and null in the dG T t contained in the WDO measurement. Therefore the interferometer should acquire data in timeframe 

Continuing constant intensity iPM beam irradiation beyond the WDO eventually brings the VX sand medium back to thermal pseudo equilibrium at elevated temperature whereupon T and T had already collapsed and the detection metric of VX sank into a noise abyss of dG T t t whereby tis the WDO closure time set by the PSCSM based prototype system running in its background mode detecting sufficiently small threshold values of T and T.

The iPM beam is polarization modulated at dot over P when traversed through PEM 45 alignment between the linear polarization axis of the beam output by the laser and the birefringence axis of the PEM is assumed for full polarization modulation of the beam . The BE may be configured as a 10 beam expander used to decrease divergence of the iPM beam sent to the SA . The SA is comprised of electromechanical actuators SA and SAthat drive the high reflectance flat mirror project the expanded and highly collimated iPM beam onto suspect CCT inside the PFOV of spectroradiometer. Beam projections correspond to four distinct CCT area heating case modes. Case 1 is for TL imaging over a full PFOV subtended onto the CCT i.e. SA and SArapidly raster scans the iPM beam over an annular area surrounding the sensor. Case 2 is for TL imaging over a segment of the PFOV subannulus area i.e. SA oscillates in bounded azimuth angle while SAoscillates in polar angles 0.39 0.20 rad covering the subannulus area of panorama. Case 3 is for TL imaging over a radial line segment of the PFOV annulus area i.e. fixed SA while SAO rapidly oscillates between 0.39 0.20 rad. Finally Case 4 is for spot imaging inside the panorama i.e. fixed SA and SA. Cases 1 through 4 enact sequentially by the PSCSM when triangulating for detection events.

Antireflection coatings may be configured on the inner and outer surfaces of the hemispherical shell W assuring maximum transmission of the iPM beam through it. Furthermore radii of curvatures of both surfaces of the hemispherical shell W are coincident at the center of the mirror as this assures nil path length deviation of iPM beam onto CCT. Finally the outer surface of the hemispherical shell W contains a hydrophobic film so that the sensor can operate in high humidity external environments.

The environment of the low vacuum internal chamber facilitates precise DHIM measurements by maintaining stable shapes and alignments of the sensor s internal optics as pressure and temperature fluctuate in the external ambient environment. Moreover the internal chamber vacuum prevents air breakdown at deep focus of PFOV radiance via the collector focuser .

The FPA of the spectroradiometer is nominally composed of small semiconductor HgCdTe photoconductive pixel elements embedded on a metalized contact pad oriented in an n n array and housed within the MIR windowed Dewar cryostat that is also pumped down to low vacuum. The HgCdTe photoconductive pixel elements of the n n array are in contact with liquid nitrogen cooling them to 77 K decreasing their intrinsic thermal noise levels and therefore increasing photonics sensitivity of the FPA by orders of magnitude. The FPA photonics signal outputs are comprised of nindependent voltage waveforms interferograms generated in the following context the imaged imPFOV beam promotes free electron hole carrier pairs EHCPs in illuminated nHgCdTe pixel elements the rate of EHCPs generated is proportional to surface conductivity rate of change dot over t in the HgCdTe semiconductor material i.e. dot over t EHCP each HgCdTe pixel element is connected in series to a bias voltage and load resistor circuit and v t v t . . . v t are interferograms measured across the load resistors of respective arrayed HgCdTe pixel circuits processed as described in step 1 above.

The collector focuser is comprised of primary and secondary hyperboloid mirrors . . The collector focuser collects and focuses MIR radiance on the center of the aperture stop AS with diffraction limited spot size. The AS may be configured with a 2.6325 mm semi diameter in one example. The primary convex hyperboloid mirror with a small bore hole through its vertex reflects converges incoming 0.93 sr radiance onto secondary concave hyperboloid mirror that retroreflects and focuses that radiance back onto the vertex of where iris AS is located. The maximum diameter of iris AS matches the bore diameter of mirror . Imaging can be sharpened by stopping down the spectroradiometer i.e. reducing the opening of iris positioned just after the collimator followed by a compensatory reducing of diameter of AS . There are two optical constraints imposed on the CF a focus constraint s where is the focal length of mirror on its concave side and s is axial displacement between mirror and mirror and a confocal constraint where s where is the focal length distance of mirror mirror on its convex convex side. Algebraic manipulation of the above two constraint relationships derives the CF optimization equation 

Again with reference to the Schwarzchild collimator optics SCO component group comprises of primary concave spheroid mirror and secondary convex spherical mirror . Mirror outputs a condensed nearly parallel beam of MIR radiance e.g. iPFOV beam passed on to the interferometer further described below.

Mirrors have a common center of curvature monocentric which coincide at the center of AS i.e. they share a common focal point located at the center of AS and obey the following relationships given an infinite SCO conjugate focal length f 2 2a 5 1 2b 5 1 2c 5 2 2d 5 2 2e where tis axial separation between mirrors pis the concave radius of curvature of mirror pin is the convex radius of curvature of mirror dis axial distance from the focal point of CF to the vertex of mirror and D D is the clear aperture diameter of mirror mirror . Accordingly the SCO is free of third order spherical aberration coma and astigmatism.

The solid state VSPA interferometer shown in performs ultrahigh speed UHS interferometry on the collimated iPFOV beam incoming from the SCO . The VSPA interferometer comprises front and back Ge linear polarizers not shown and a VSPA bar PEM which comprises a single stress birefringence ZnSe crystal not shown with an array of ultrasonic frequency piezoelectric transducers PZTs not shown bonded across the length of crystal. The PZT generates elastic waves EWs within the ZnSe medium which is further described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 764 415 the complete disclosure of which in its entirety is herein incorporated by reference. Behaviors of these induced EWs can be simulated such that the simulated model essentially emulates transients of the VSPA bar PEM undergoing piezoelectric compression relaxation in precisely timed and regulated cycles. Such transients induce a linear array of active resonance cells ARCs within the VSPA bar PEM medium resembling a virtual stack of oscillating phase retarder plates. The VSPA interferometer includes an array of ARCs comprising EW wave reinforcement antinodes A and cancellation nodes N defining the ARC boundaries whereby the vertical arrow represents the optical path of the lpPFOV to pmPFOV beam traveling through the bar . The VSPA bar PEM attains maximum effective birefringence when all ARCs oscillate in phase namely when individual ARC birefringences add constructively. Under this condition the spectroradiometer of exhibits its highest spectral resolution.

The Jones matrix J matrix expresses the aggregate time dependent stress birefringence behavior of VSPA interferometer accordingly 

The imager component of spectroradiometer in further comprises lens systems including a front ZnSe biconvex convex concave lens doublet and a back ZnSe convex concave convex plano convex plano lens triplet and a focal plane detector FPA array . The Front lens group and the back lens groups are separated by air gap . The lens elements per group touch on optical axis and all lens surfaces are anti reflection coated. The separation between FPA and lens surface is approximately 0.0050 mm in one example to allow for liquid nitrogen contact and 77 K cooling of the FPA s facing HgCdTe photoconductive pixel elements.

A parametric optimization of laser transmitter of and spectroradiometer receiver of of the PSCSM integrated together is described below starting from Hudson s systems engineering equation which is further described in Hudson Jr. R. D. The analysis of infrared systems pp. 417 421 John Wiley Sons New York 1969 which is incorporated herein by reference EP NA where R is the maximum detection range of the PSCSM in units of meters. The first bracket of Equation 4 specifies radiance of liberated TL fluxes pumped via the iPM beam of J in units of Wsr times atmospheric attenuation a which is unitless of TL liberated radiances from suspect CCT to the entrance pupil EP of spectroradiometer . There is some control over the J parameter as it depends on energy intensity and polarization modulation states of the iPM beam . Also is usually modeled from standard atmospheric transmission programs like HITRAN however it is set to unity for the relatively low detection ranges of a tactical defense system TDS of . The second bracket of Equation 4 specifies parameters associated to the spectroradiometer EP units of meters times numerical aperture NA which is unitless times J throughput from Wr to FPA trrtt also unitless where subscripted t and r symbols denote transmission and reflection coefficients of respective optic groups as shown in . There are nuances of design selection to consider here increasing decreasing EP size increases decreases effective focal length thereby increasing decreasing FPA image size NA rarely exceeds 0.5 in practical optical systems and tis theoretically limited to a maximum value of 0.25. The third bracket of Equation 4 is a figure of merit of the liquid nitrogen cooled FPA called Detectivity D in units of mHzW . D equates to reciprocal noise equivalent power normalized to 8 12 m optical spectral bandwidth of the spectroradiometer. The fourth bracket of Equation 4 specifies parameters associated to optics and electronics modules of the PSCSM based prototype system PFOV solid angle subtended onto the FPA in sr units times noise equivalent bandwidth of digital data acquisition system dF in units of Hz to the power times reciprocal signal to noise ratio of coadded interferogram datasets which is unitless . is functionally dependent on iPM irradiation dwell time on the CCT and data acquisition rate of interferometer waveforms namely . Here decreasing either or dF increases R to a 4th root power.
