No. 13 396 392 filed on Feb. 14 2012 which claims benefit to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 472 609 filed on Apr. 6 2011 and which is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 396 368 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 261 231 filed on Feb. 14 2012. The contents of the above identified applications are incorporated by reference in their entirety as if recited in full herein.

The present invention generally relates to systems and methods for developing computer software applications. More specifically certain embodiments are directed to systems and methods for developing deploying and updating cross platform mobile device applications through an Internet based mobile application development and deployment platform that allows non technical users and developers to build sophisticated highly customizable applications. Some embodiments are directed to systems and methods for developing deploying and updating software applications that allow non technical users and developers to build sophisticated highly customizable applications or portions of such applications on devices capable of running such applications and or app enabled accessories.

Mobile devices such as smart phones tablet PCs and other handheld devices have become widespread and important to the daily activities of many consumers and businesses. Traditionally these type of devices have primarily served as communications devices. Recently however consumers are increasingly relying upon these devices as an integral tool in the performance of a wide range of personal and work related tasks. In response mobile phones and other wireless handheld devices have evolved into complex computing devices with equally complex computer hardware and software.

While many of these mobile devices continue to be used for various forms of communication e.g. voice calls and text messaging they also generally provide other various functionalities including accessing and displaying websites sending and receiving e mails taking and displaying photographs and videos playing music and other forms of audio etc. These and numerous other functionalities are generally performed by software applications either in the form of software components that are built in to the device s mobile operating system or separate mobile applications mobile apps that run on top of the operating system. Recently the development and use of mobile apps has become prolific and thousands of apps now exist across a wide array of mobile devices.

Numerous competing manufacturers developers and other service providers have entered the mobile device space in recent years offering hardware software in the form of mobile operating systems or in some cases a combination of both hardware and software. This in turn has resulted in the development of a number of dissimilar and incompatible mobile device platforms and environments. Some of the differences among these devices include their hardware components operating systems and input and output capabilities. In fact many of the most widely used mobile devices such as Blackberrys iPhones and Android based devices use different operating systems e.g. Symbian iOS Android and webOS many of which have their own programming environments and software development tools.

Typically developing mobile applications for these different operating systems and devices requires the use of varying design techniques and programming languages as well as separate operating system or device specific software code and compilations. As a result it is often challenging for developers to write software applications that are portable across multiple types of mobile devices. Instead mobile app developers are frequently forced to rewrite all or at least substantial portions of the software in order to support different devices.

In order to encourage and facilitate the development of mobile apps for certain types of mobile operating systems and or devices the manufacturers and developers of these systems and devices frequently distribute software development kits SDKs that are associated with their devices and or operating systems or particular versions or releases thereof . Among other things these SDKs allow application developers to write programs or applications for users of the supported mobile devices and or mobile operating systems. While these SDKs assist with the development of mobile apps in order to utilize these SDKs a significant degree of technical knowledge and expertise in software programming and mobile devices is typically required. In particular use of these SDKs requires programmers to possess an understanding of and experience with both the programming language and the specific mobile operating system platform for which the application is being developed.

In addition to the challenges associated with building mobile apps deploying these applications and distributing them to end users can often be a complex and involved process. In part this is due to the fact that many of the mobile device and operating system manufacturers and developers require that all mobile apps to be used with their devices and operating systems must be distributed through their digital distribution platform e.g. iOS s App Store Android s Google Play webOS s App Catalog . Typically the apps must also be approved by the manufacturers or developers prior to being included in their distribution platforms. Obtaining such approvals for a mobile applications can be a time consuming and complex process. As a result an understanding of and experience with the requirements and restrictions imposed by manufacturers is often necessary in order to deploy and distribute applications to mobile device users successfully and efficiently.

Similarly these manufacturers and developers often require that any additional data associated with the application such as updates plug ins extensions and content also be distributed through their digital distribution platforms. In some cases certain types of updates are also subject to separate approval by the manufacturers. Thus these restrictions can further complicate and slow down the distribution and management of mobile applications.

As an increasing number of mobile applications have been developed for mobile handheld devices and as consumers have come to rely on mobile applications in an increasing number of situations devices other than handheld mobile devices have provided additional platforms for running applications. For example many vehicles now include infotainment systems that support a variety of applications. Other devices such as video game consoles satellite navigation systems digital media receivers and other home appliances such as refrigerators can also support certain mobile applications. As with development for mobile devices developing applications for these other devices often requires developers to have a significant degree of technical knowledge as well as experience in software programming and the SDKs for the particular device for which the application is developed.

Given the high level of skill and expertise needed to create deploy and update mobile applications many non technical individuals as well as individuals lacking experience in a particular programming language or mobile operating system or digital distribution platform have are not able to develop and or distribute mobile applications. Although there have been attempts to make mobile application development more accessible to a wider public through software systems that allow persons who do not have significant experience in programming or specific mobile operating system platforms to create mobile applications these systems have exhibited a number of drawbacks and limitations which have resulted in their failure to be widely adopted by consumers.

For example one drawback is that many of these software systems allow non technical users to create applications for only one mobile operating system such as for example iOS Android webOS or Symbian or a restricted subset of the operating systems . In light of the number of different mobile operating systems including a number of which are widely used the ability to develop an application that can be easily ported across all mobile operating systems or at least those with meaningful consumer bases is a crucial in promoting efficient and simplified mobile application development.

Another drawback is that many of these software systems still require substantial technical knowledge and expertise and therefore these systems do not simplify the process to the degree necessary to make mobile app development accessible to non technical users. Some of these systems are not intuitive to use involve user training and or require at least a base level of technical knowledge such as exposure to application programming and design.

Yet another drawback is that many of these software systems place significant limitations on the types of applications that can be built using the system. For example many of these systems only provide users with the ability to create simple non flexible applications that prohibit the utilization of the wide range of features and specific functionalities included within many mobile devices and their respective mobile operating systems such as a compass GPS gyroscope touch screen camera speaker microphone Bluetooth Wi Fi USB connectivity and proximity sensor. In addition many products such as app enabled accessories are designed to interact with mobile applications on mobile devices and such products may be configured controlled and or monitored by mobile devices through mobile applications. Many of the software systems for developing mobile applications do not provide the ability to interact with app enabled accessories. As a result with these types of systems special programming skills and expertise is needed to use install additional components plug ins modules or emulators in order to create more sophisticated mobile apps that utilize these features and functionalities. Also some of the resulting applications built using existing systems or development tools are only usable while the user s device is online. In addition some of these systems require the user to download updates for the application from a third party such as the mobile operating system s digital distribution platform rather that from the application developer directly.

There is therefore a need for a system that simplifies and streamlines the development deployment and update of mobile software applications thereby making the process accessible to non technical users through an enhanced user friendly experience. There is also an need for a system that allows users to develop an application that can run on any mobile device operating system. There is also a need for a system that allows users to develop an application that can run on other devices that support mobile and other specialized applications. There is further a need for a system that allows users to create sophisticated applications that utilize a customized combination of mobile device and mobile operating system features and functionality as well as features and functionality provided by app enabled accessories. There is still further a need for a system that is web based while also enabling users to access applications developed through the platform off line. There is still further a need for a system that provides users with updates associated with applications directly without the need to access the mobile operating system s digital distribution platform.

One aspect of the invention is to provide a mobile application development and deployment platform that allows developers to design build distribute and manage mobile software applications. Another aspect of the invention is to provide such a platform that is accessible to non technical users and operable through an easy to use intuitive user interface that does not require users to possess expertise in computer programming or mobile devices and applications. Yet another aspect of the invention is to provide such a platform that allows for a high degree of customizability and allows users to create sophisticated application through the customization and combination of various components such as app types modules content elements and templates that can access features of various mobile devices mobile operating systems other devices capable of running applications and app enabled accessories. Yet another aspect of the invention is to provide such a platform that allows users to create customize update and deploy other types of applications such as mobile games and web applications through the development platform.

Another aspect of the invention is to provide a mobile development platform that is accessible through the Internet without the need for users to download or install any separate software while enabling the applications developed through the platform to be accessible off line. Yet another aspect of the invention is to provide such a platform that allows users to build a single application or portions of an application that can be compiled for use across a wide range of mobile devices operating systems and other devices capable of running specialized applications. Yet another aspect of the invention is to provide such a platform that manages the deployment and distribution through third party digital distribution platforms of applications developed using the platform. Yet another aspect of the invention is to provide such a platform that allows applications to be assembled and updated on the fly through the use of configuration files that may be downloaded by end users and which include a reference to and or subset of the application that is used to access application data from a remote source. Yet another aspect of the invention is to provide such a platform that provides updates content and other data associated with the application to users directly without the need for users to reinstall the application or to download such updates content or data from a digital distribution platform.

In certain embodiments the developer may be allowed to enable and disable graphical wizard .

In certain embodiments application development window may include a progress indicator such as progress bar depicted in which may indicate the developer s progress through the application development process. In certain embodiments progress bar may indicate one or more steps that have been completed and or that still need to be completed by the developer to finish the current mobile app. For example the application creation and deployment process may be divided into any number of sub processes. As a developer moves through the app design and deployment process progress bar may be updated to reflect the status of each sub process. The progress bar may also or alternatively reflect the quality of the app which may be updated based on the uniqueness of the app such as the type and or amount of customizations selected or content added and uploaded by the developer.

In certain of these embodiments such as where the mobile development environment is provided in the form of a web based service the sub processes may be represented by one or more web pages that allows the developer to step through the process of application development and deployment in a page by page or similar manner. In accordance with certain of these embodiments graphical wizard may guide the developer through one or more of the steps associated with each page or section. In certain other embodiments the steps and or sub processes may be combined into a single group of options and settings for the developer to select as desired such as within a single web page.

For example according to certain embodiments the mobile app creation and deployment process accessed through by the web based service may be divided into four main sub processes app properties app design app content and app publishing. After selecting an option to create a new app a developer may be prompted to complete an app properties sub process. Through the app properties sub process the developer may select upload and or input various high level settings for the app such as a name icon image and or splash screen image for the app. The developer may then proceed to the app design sub process through which the developer may select upload and or input various design and layout options for the app such as a color scheme background image and or app type. After selecting and customizing the high level properties and overall design of the app the developer may proceed to the app content sub process through which the developer may add modify combine and customize the functionalities and content of the app such as by adding and customizing various modules and content elements to be included in the app. Once the developer has completed the creation and design of the app and its content the developer may then move to the app publishing sub process. Through this sub process the developer may select various publishing properties such as target mobile device types app description app category copyright settings and or keywords and publish the app. In certain of these embodiments the app publishing sub process may check whether the app meets certain minimal requirements for publishing and if not may indicate any deficiencies to the developer.

In certain embodiments each of the four sub processes described above may be presented to and or accessed by the developer through a separate web page or web pages. In certain other embodiments these sub processes may be presented in the form of tabs within a single web page or any other method suitable for use within a web based service. It should be understood that the four sub processes and their names are described above for the purpose of illustration only any number of sub processes could be used in connection with the mobile app creation and deployment platform and or corresponding web based service.

For example in certain embodiments such as where the developer desires to create a new mobile app the mobile development platform may display a web page displaying certain available predefined app types. The mobile development environment may prompt the user to select an app type for the new app and or input or select certain basic properties for the app such as a name an icon file to be displayed on the mobile device and its location splash screen images and or the target mobile device categories or mobile device types. In certain of these embodiments one or more keywords may be associated with the app which may be generated automatically based on the developer s selections and input and or provided by the developer. In certain embodiments these keywords may be used by the mobile development environment and or the developer in connection with the distribution of the app to end users such as to associate the app with one or more predefined app categories included in a digital distribution platform or to allow end users to search for the app using keyword searches.

In certain embodiments such as after the developer selects an app type and or selects or inputs certain basic application properties for a new app or selects an existing app to modify the mobile development environment may display various predefined application components such as modules and or application design elements such as themes and layouts that can be selected customized and or included in the mobile app. In certain embodiments after selecting a particular application component or design element the developer may be presented with and select input and modify certain options associated with the selected component or design element including content elements settings features and associated sub components. For example after selecting a particular predefined module to include in the app the mobile development environment may display a web page showing the available layouts for the selected module and or various module properties or attributes that may be selected or modified. The mobile development environment may prompt the developer to input or upload certain content associated with the application component such as text images videos etc.

In certain embodiments in addition to or instead of selecting a predefined application component or design element the developer may be allowed to create or upload custom components or elements for inclusion in the mobile app such as by creating a template for a custom component in a similar manner to that described in connection with . In certain embodiments the developer may view modify and or remove certain previously selected components design elements or content elements provided by the developer. As discussed in connection with the mobile development environment may display and update a graphical representation of the current state of the application based on the selections and input provided by the developer.

In accordance with certain embodiments such as where the developer desires to update an existing mobile application the mobile development environment may display a list of apps that the developer has previously created such as apps that are in progress and prompt the developer to select an app to modify or update. The mobile development environment may present the developer with the current state of the selected app and allow the user to add modify customize create and or remove application components design elements content elements and other data in a manner similar to that described above. In certain of these embodiments the mobile development platform may retrieve the selected app and its data from a storage device such as a remote database server as discussed in more detail below.

At step the mobile development environment saves certain selections updates and or inputs provided by the developer during the application development process. In certain embodiments the mobile development environment may store this information in an remote application database local database or any other suitable storage medium. In certain of these embodiments the mobile development environment may access the database and create and or update certain entries in the database and its tables and relationships therebetween in a manner similar to that described in connection with . In certain embodiments the mobile development environment may automatically store the developer s selections input and other application data after each such selection is made or input provided. In other embodiments the mobile development environment may store this information after prompting the developer and or receiving an indication from the developer to save the app. In yet other embodiments the information may be stored after the developer completes certain steps or portions of application development process as discussed in connection with . In certain embodiments the mobile development environment may generate and store additional information associated with the app such a unique identifier and change log.

At step the mobile development environment may determine whether the developer has provided enough information e.g. selections and input to complete the app. In certain embodiments the mobile development environment may make this determination after the developer completes certain steps or sections of the application development process. In certain other embodiments the mobile development environment may prompt the developer and or wait until the developer indicates a desire to complete and or deploy the mobile app. If the mobile development environment determines that the developer has supplied enough information to complete the app at step the mobile development environment prompts the developer to indicate whether the app is complete and if so the process proceeds to step . Otherwise flow returns to step where the developer is able to modify the application such as by adding removing and updating application components elements and content.

After the developer indicates that the mobile application is complete at step the mobile development platform may prompt the developer to select one or more mobile device categories mobile device types and or particular mobile device models on which the app is intended to run. In certain embodiments the developer may select the mobile device categories types and models earlier in the process such as when entering the application properties. In accordance with certain of these embodiments the mobile development environment may use the selected mobile device categories types and models to update the available application components or design elements that may be selected by the developer. In certain other embodiments the developer may be allowed to select or modify the target mobile device categories types and models at any time prior to compilation of the app.

At step the mobile development environment creates certain reference data for the application such as a configuration file or similar data. In certain embodiments the reference data may contain basic information associated with the app such as the app s unique identifier. In other embodiments the reference data may include additional or other information such as an application s icon file location an app name a splash image file location a security key a web address to access on the app s launch execution or any combination of the same and or other information relevant to the app. In yet other embodiments the reference data may include all of the data needed by and associated with the app.

At step the mobile development platform builds and compiles the app for the selected mobile device categories types and or models. In certain embodiments the app may be compiled and built using certain native compilers and or build tools provided by the manufacturers or developers of the mobile operating systems and mobile devices. For example the mobile development may use such tools to build a shell or empty app for a selected mobile device category which includes the reference data. As discussed in more detail below when the app is downloaded installed and or launched on a mobile device the app may then use the reference data to access and retrieve certain data associated with the app.

After the app is compiled at step the app may then be submitted to digital distribution platforms for distribution to end users. For example the compiled app may be submitted to one or more digital distribution platforms associated with the selected mobile device categories types and or models e.g. iOS s App Store Android s Google Play webOS s App Catalog OpenAppMkt etc. . In certain other embodiments such as where the digital distribution platform is integrated with the mobile development environment or developer s computer the compiled app may be distributed directly to end users. According to certain embodiments the developer may be required to submit the compiled app to the digital distribution platforms manually. In certain other embodiments the mobile development platform may automatically submit the compiled app to the digital distribution platforms such as after compiling the app. The mobile development platform may also manage certain approval processes and other actions required by the digital distribution platforms.

It should be understood that the order of the steps illustrated in and described herein are merely exemplary and the order or combination in which various steps such as selecting application components inputting application and component properties and storing the application data are performed may be modified or may be performed in any order or combination that is appropriate or desired by the developer or mobile development platform provider.

Thus as can be seen from and their accompanying description the systems and methods described herein allow non technical users to build cross platform mobile applications that utilize various feature and functions including features specific to particular mobile operating systems and mobile devices through a user friendly software tool. Accordingly one significant advantage is that these users can design build and deploy highly customizable and sophisticated mobile apps without the need for technical expertise in computer programming or mobile operating systems and devices.

In certain of these embodiments the application components design elements content elements and other data as well as their relationships to each other may be represented and stored in a database such as relational database. In certain other embodiments these relationships and the application data may be represented and or stored in any other suitable format and or medium such as in tables trees sets of links or other similar structures. By storing this information in a relational manner mobile apps developed through the mobile development and distribution platform can be easily stored retrieved built and updated simply by representing each app through a series of relationships between the application s components elements and other data. Moreover the architecture described and illustrated in enables new application components content elements and design elements created or customized by developers or other third parties to be added to the mobile development and deployment platform and used by developers in the development of future mobile apps. It should be understood that the particular data model and corresponding tables attributes and relationships described below and illustrated in are intended to be exemplary in nature. Accordingly the data model could be represented and stored in any other suitable format or combination of formats known in the art and or the tables attributes and relationships could be replaced by or combined with various other tables attributes relationships or other similar data.

In certain embodiments the data model may contain a set of data tables each of which may represent and store certain information associated with the apps such as application components design elements content elements and other data related to the apps. As shown in the data model may include Apps table which in this example represents a mobile app designed and created through the mobile development platform such as the web based mobile development and deployment service and environment illustrated and described in connection with . Apps table contains various attributes and information associated with each app such as Apps attributes which may include a unique identifier for the app an identifier of the app s app type and a name for the app. In certain embodiments each mobile app developed through the mobile development and distribution platform may be represented by an instance of Apps table such as a row entry in a corresponding table stored in a database. In certain of these embodiments the Apps table serves as the head table for each mobile app with the app s application data represented by and stored in various other data tables that branch out from Apps table such as through a number of relationships amongst the tables. Accordingly each app and its corresponding data can be easily retrieved such as by looking up the app s unique identifier in Apps table .

As shown in in certain embodiments the data model may include AppTypes table which represents the type of app associated with each mobile app e.g. magazine app blogging app doctor app or other app types such as the exemplary app types listed and described in the sections below . AppTypes table may contain various attributes associated with each app type such as AppTypes attributes which include a unique identifier and name for each app type. In certain of these embodiments when a developer selects an app type for a new or existing app the entry associated with the app in Apps table may be modified to include the unique identifier for the selected app type. Similarly the data model may include AppTheme table which represents a theme associated with each app. AppTheme table may contain various attributes and information such as AppTheme attributes which include the app s unique identifier a unique identifier for the theme as well as the font font size and font color associated with the theme. In certain of these embodiments each mobile app may be associated with a particular app type and or theme and the corresponding identifiers may be stored in Apps table thereby forming a relationship between Apps table AppTypes table and AppTheme table . In turn this allows the app type theme and their corresponding attributes and data for each mobile app to be retrieved through the app s unique identifier such as by using the app type identifier stored in Apps table and looking up the app s identifier in AppTheme table .

According to certain embodiments the data model may include AppModules table which represents and or stores the modules included within each app. In certain embodiments each module may be associated with certain features or functionality that are included within the mobile app. AppModules table may contain various attributes associated with each app and its modules such as AppModules attributes which includes the app s unique identifier as well as a unique identifier for the module an identifier for the module s type and an identifier for the module s layout. In certain embodiments as shown in the data model may include ModuleType table comprising ModuleType attributes which may include various attributes associated with each type of module such as a unique identifier and a name for the module type. In certain of these embodiments the data model may include a number of predefined module tables that correspond to various type of modules available for use in mobile apps developed through the mobile development and distribution platform e.g. a contacts module photos module videos module or other types of modules such as the exemplary modules discussed in connection with and which include various attributes associated with the particular type of module such as the options features functionality and content for the module.

Each app developed through the mobile development and distribution platform may include a number of modules including multiple modules of the same or differing types each of which may be represented and stored in the tables associated with the particular type of module. For example as shown in the data model may include ModuleContacts table ModulePhotos table and ModuleVideos table . Each of these module tables may contain various attributes content and other data that may be associated with each type of module such as the contactModule identifier and contact list included in ModuleContacts attributes the photoModule identifier and imageFiles reference included in ModulePhotos attributes and the videoModule identifier and videoLinks stored in VideoModule attributes . In certain embodiments each module table includes an appModule identifier which corresponds to the unique identifier for the particular instance of the module in the app and which may be stored in AppModules table .

As discussed in connection with and each type of module may be associated with certain features and functionality provided to end users through the app. In certain embodiments the software code or logic associated with the module or any other application component or design element may be stored in the database such as in AppModules table or may be stored in a separate location in which case a reference to the location of the code may be stored in the table. In certain embodiments some of the modules may represent features and functions that are common across all or a wide range of mobile device categories and types such as text messaging GPS functionality cameras etc. Other modules may represent features and functions that are specific to a particular or only a few mobile device categories types or models such as touch screen functionality or other specific forms of user inputs video cameras compass gyroscope and other sensors Bluetooth etc. As a result in certain of these embodiments the module tables may include one or more attributes that indicate whether the module is associated with or limited to one or more mobile device categories types or models. As discussed in more detail below in certain embodiments the mobile development environment may use these as well as other attributes in determining whether to display a particular type of module to the developer and or allow the developer to select and include the module in an app based on the mobile device categories types or models selected by the developer. Exemplary modules and the features functionality and content associated therewith are described and illustrated in further detail in connection with .

In certain embodiments each module may be associated with one or more layouts which represent the design of the module within the app such as its location orientation and format. For example as shown in the data model may include Layouts table containing various attributes and information associated with available layouts for a module such as Layouts attributes which includes a name and unique identifier for each layout corresponding to the layout identifier included in AppModules table . In this regard each app s modules and their respective attributes content layouts software code and other data corresponding to the modules can easily be retrieved from the data model by looking up the app s unique identifier in AppModules table .

According to certain embodiments each app type may be associated with a particular subset of module types that may be selected by developers for mobile apps developed through the mobile development and distribution platform using that app type. For example as shown in the data model may include AppType ModuleType table comprising AppType ModuleType attributes which may include various attributes associated with each type of module such as an app type identifier and a module type identifier. By including the identifiers in AppType ModuleType table that correspond to the app type and module type identifiers in AppType table and ModuleType table the types of modules associated with and or available for use with particular app types may be determined quickly by querying AppType ModuleType table . For example in certain embodiments such as where the developer accesses the mobile development service through a web based service after selecting an app type for a new mobile app or modifying an existing app s app type the service may look up the available modules for the selected app type in AppType ModuleType table and present them to the developer. Accordingly in certain embodiments while a particular type of module may be available for use with a number of different app types each app type has a discreet set of module types that may be used by developers who are developing mobile apps using that app type. As described in more detail below in certain embodiments developers may be given the option to create a new app type or customize and existing app type for use with mobile apps developed through the mobile development and distribution platform. In accordance with certain of these embodiments the developer may create or customize these new app types in part by selecting and or modifying the set of module types associated with the newly created app type.

The data model may include other data tables that comprise attributes and other information associated with each mobile app. As shown in the data model may include AppCategory table containing AppCategory attributes that includes certain attributes related to an app s category. This information may be based on the category or categories in which the app falls that are used in certain digital distribution platforms. In certain of these embodiments the developer may be presented with and prompted to select one or more app categories based on the mobile device category type or model selected for the app. For example if the developer indicates that the app is intended to operate on mobile devices using the iOS or Android mobile operating systems the developer may be prompted to select one of the predefined app categories provided by iOS s App Store or Android s Google Play such as Book Travel Business Home etc.

As shown in the data model may include AppDevices table containing AppDevices attributes that stores certain attributes related to the mobile device categories and or mobile device types with which an app is associated. For example these attributes may include a developer s selections relating to the type of mobile operating system e.g. iOS or Android or the type of device e.g. tablet smart phone that the app is intended to operate on. The data model may include AppUpdate Launch table containing AppUpdate Launch attributes that stores certain information and data related to the app s status and or use by end users as illustrated in . As discussed in more detail in connection with below in certain embodiments this table may be used to keep track of various statistics for an app such as the number of times it is launched or updated when each update occurred and or the particular end user s associated with each update.

According to certain embodiments the data model may be used in connection with the mobile development and distribution platform to facilitate the design creation and modification of mobile apps by developers such as through the mobile development environment and or web based service illustrated and described in connection with . In certain of these embodiments the data model may be used as the basis for one or more databases that are used to represent and store certain data associated with each app developed through the mobile development environment. The databases may be hosted by one or more servers which in certain embodiments may be integrated with the server s hosting the mobile development environment e.g. server or one or more separate servers e.g. database server such as is shown in .

In accordance with certain of these embodiments the mobile development environment and or web based service may access the databases to store certain selections made by as well as data input and or uploaded by developers during the mobile app creation and modification process. For example when a developer creates a new app the mobile development environment may create a new entry in the database such as in AppsTable . Likewise in response to the developer selecting and modifying various application components content elements and or design elements for the app the mobile development environment may create new and update existing entries in the database and or form relationships between the database entries.

In certain of these embodiments the database may be utilized by the mobile development platform and or environment when a mobile app is compiled and distributed to end users. As discussed in more detail in connection with above after a developer has finished creating and or modifying an app the mobile development environment may compile the app for one or more mobile device categories and mobile device types and or distribute the compiled app to end users such as through a third party digital distribution platform. In certain of these embodiments the compiled app may not include all of the data needed by or associated with the app. Instead the compiled app may simply include an unique identifier for the app and or a configurations file or other basic information for the app. In certain of these embodiments this information may be compile using or based on the database. For example as part of the compiling process the database may be queried to retrieve certain attributes and relationships associated with the app which may be included in a configurations file. After being downloaded installed and or launched by an end user the compiled app may then use this information to access the application data from the database that corresponds to the app. In certain embodiments as discussed in more detail in connection with mobile apps that have already been installed on mobile devices may be updated through a similar process such as by checking the database for new application data or content each time the app is launched.

The database and or data model may also or alternatively be used to facilitate the design creation and modification of mobile apps by developers through the environment in certain embodiments such as where the mobile development environment is provided in the form of a web based or software based graphical interface. In certain of these embodiments the mobile development environment may access the database to retrieve and display various predefined application components design elements content elements and other information associated with the mobile apps to developers. For example when a developer creates a new app the mobile development environment may query the database to retrieve the predefined app types and or themes currently stored in the database present these app types and or themes to the developer and allow the developer to browse through and select a particular app type and or theme for the new app. As another example after the developer selects a particular app type for the app the mobile development environment may then query the database to retrieve and display all of the types of modules that may be included in the app based on the selected app type. As yet another example the mobile development environment may access the database to retrieve and display the available mobile device categories and or mobile device types that may be selected by the developer.

In certain embodiments the mobile development platform may provide developers with the ability to create custom templates or other components for use with mobile applications developed through the platform. In certain of these embodiments a developer may begin with a blank template and or be guided through various steps associated with the creation of a custom template for an application component design element content element or other application data such as by being presented with various options settings layouts themes content features or functionalities that can be included or associated with the custom template. The developer may select from among various predefined sub components content elements and design elements and or create new sub components content elements and design elements that can be incorporated within mobile applications designed and developed utilizing the custom template.

For example after accessing the mobile development environment and creating a new app instead of or in addition to being able to select a predefined app type the developer may be given the option to create a new custom app type for use with the new app. The developer may then select input and or modify certain options settings and attributes for the custom app type such as a name splash image icon and associated modules. Similarly in selecting the modules to be associated with the custom app type or to be included in a new or existing app the developer may select from among certain predefined modules and or create one or more custom modules in which case the developer may select and input various options for the module such as a name type one or more layouts functionalities and associated content. As another example the developer may create a custom theme for the app or custom layout for a module by selecting various design attributes and settings such as font type size and color background position orientation etc.

In certain embodiments the data model and or associated database s may be used by the mobile development platform to facilitate the creation and modification of custom application components design elements or other data by developers for use in mobile apps developed through the platform. When a developer selects an option to create a custom template for a component content element or design element the mobile development environment may query the database to retrieve the relevant attributes settings content and sub components that may be selected input and or combined by the developer to create the customized application component or design element.

In certain of these embodiments the custom template may be saved by the mobile development platform such as by storing it in the database and or associated data model. The custom templates may then be available for use in future apps by the developer and or by other developers. For example when a developer creates a custom app type the mobile development platform may create a new entry in the database such as in AppType table . This app type may then be automatically loaded and presented to developers creating new apps through the platform as one of the available predefined app types. In certain embodiments third party developers or manufacturers may be allowed to create custom components or design elements such as modules with related module logic for mobile apps and make these custom modules available to developers and users in the creation of mobile apps through the mobile development and distribution platform.

As can be seen from and the corresponding description above there are a number of benefits associated with storing application data and other information associated with the mobile apps in this manner. One such benefit is that it allows apps created and modified through the mobile development platform to be stored and represented in a simplified form such as entries in a database without the need to store the corresponding software code application logic and settings for each app separately. Another such benefit is that new types of application components design elements content elements and other settings and application data can easily be added to and existing ones modified in the mobile development platform and used by developers simply by adding and or modifying the entries in the database and or corresponding data model. These new or updated components design elements content elements and other data can then be automatically presented to and used by developers in their mobile apps. Yet another such benefit associated with the data model described above is that it allows developers to create highly customizable apps by creating and saving custom templates for application components content elements and design elements as well as selecting modifying and combining predefined components and design elements. In turn this provides developers with an extensible and continually evolving development environment by allowing developers to take advantage of new components content elements design elements and other data created and or customized by other developers.

When the end user launches the mobile app at step the app may determine whether it is the first time that the app is being executed on the mobile device. If so the process proceeds to step otherwise at step the app determines whether certain data associated with and or needed by the application has been stored locally e.g. cached on the mobile device. If cached data exists for the app the app may determine whether the cached data should still be maintained and used by the app. For example the mobile app may determine whether to continue using the cached application data by querying a server or other computer system hosting the application data to determine whether the cached application data needs to be updated e.g. whether the application data hosted on the server has been modified since being downloaded and stored at the mobile device .

As another example the mobile app may determine whether cached application data should be used based on detecting that the app and or mobile device is unable to access the servers or systems where the application data resides e.g. the mobile device is off line or the servers or systems are unavailable . If the mobile app determines that there is no cached application data or that cached application data should be discarded and or updated the process proceeds to step . Otherwise at step the mobile app loads the cached application data and proceeds to step . One significant advantage associated with the caching of application data is that mobile applications developed through the mobile development platform may still be used even when the mobile device is off line. In certain embodiments the mobile app mobile device and or end user may disable the caching of application data either for a particular app or apps or for all apps running on the mobile device in which case steps and of the process may be omitted.

At step the mobile app requests and receives certain application data from the servers or systems hosting the data. In certain embodiments the mobile application may request and receive the application data from servers associated with the mobile development platform such as database server illustrated in . In certain other embodiments the application data may be requested and received from a digital distribution platform or directly from servers operated by the developer. In yet other embodiments the mobile app and or mobile device may retrieve the application data from one or more intermediary servers that interface with both or either of the mobile development platform and or database server or from other servers hosted and operated by third party service providers.

In certain embodiments such as where the mobile app is compiled and downloaded by end users in the form of reference data such as a configuration file rather than the complete application data the mobile app may use the reference data to retrieve the relevant application data. In certain of these embodiments the mobile app may send an app identifier or other app identifying information to the server hosting the application data. The server may use this information to look up retrieve and send the corresponding application data to the mobile device. In certain of these embodiments such as where the app and its data is stored in a database and or represented by a corresponding data model the server may use the app identifier to look up the app in a database table and retrieve the application data by following the relationships or links to other tables that are associated with the app in a manner similar to that described in connection with .

The application data may include any data that is associated with the mobile app and or needed to execute and display the app and its content on the mobile device. For example the server may send certain data associated with the application components design elements features and content included in or associated with the mobile app such as app types modules content layouts themes settings and other information to the mobile device. In certain other embodiments such as where the entire application is compiled and downloaded and installed on the mobile device the mobile app may request and receive updates to the application data and or content in a similar manner to the process described above. In accordance with certain embodiments such as where the mobile app and or mobile device is adapted to cache certain application data after receiving application data from the server the mobile app may store the application data in the memory of the mobile device.

After receiving the application data and or loading the cached application data at step the mobile app may utilize the application data to build and display the app on the mobile device such as by incorporating the application components content elements design elements functions and settings into the application and or formatting the display and operation of the application.
