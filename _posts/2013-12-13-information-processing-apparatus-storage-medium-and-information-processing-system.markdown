An aspect of this disclosure is related to an information processing apparatus a computer readable storage medium and an information processing system. In particular an aspect of this disclosure is related to an information processing apparatus which may operate in a first operation mode and a second operation mode in which power consumption is lower than the first operation mode.

Conventionally an image forming apparatus such as a printer has various functions such as a copy function a scanner function and a fax function and is used in an office or another place. Recently in addition to conventional usage such as printing with the printer function or scanning with the scanner function the image forming apparatus gets to be used as an information processing apparatus. The image forming apparatus may run various application programs hereinafter called application selected by a user after showing an application selection screen on a display unit of the image forming apparatus. The image forming apparatus is in a standby mode which enables each application to create and display a UI screen for accepting user operations on the display unit in a short time.

However when the user is not going to use the image forming apparatus for a while the user may shut off the main power of the image forming apparatus. Responding to a rise in awareness of energy saving an image forming apparatus becomes common which may transition to an energy saving mode while the image forming apparatus is not being used and go back to the standby mode when the image forming apparatus is to be used. The user desires to check the UI screen of the application display and start to use it as soon as possible from a main power off state or the energy saving mode. However when the image forming apparatus is in the main power off state the user has to wait an amount of time required to complete start processes for the image forming apparatus and the application the user desires to use. When the image forming apparatus is in the energy saving mode the user has to wait an amount of time required to complete a transition process for the image forming apparatus to transition to the standby mode and a start process for the application.

A technology has been developed to reduce the time required for the start processes and the transition process of the image forming apparatus as well as the start process of the application e.g. Patent Document 1 . Patent Document 1 discloses an information processing apparatus which starts the application performing a function specified in priority information stored in an EEPROM when the information processing apparatus is switched on. When the start process of the application completes the information processing apparatus transitions to a state in which an initial screen for the started function is displayed and user operations may be accepted. Thus the information processing apparatus may start the application prioritized by the user and show a screen desired by the user quickly.

Although the information processing apparatus starts the prioritized application the user does not necessarily use the same application at any time. Thus a start process of the other application that the user desires to use may be delayed. In addition when two users User A and User B desire to use applications different from each other the information processing apparatus has the potential to start one application which is not desired by either User A or User B.

At least one embodiment of the present invention is aimed at resolving the above problem and providing an information processing apparatus which makes it possible to display a screen of an application desired by a user quickly.

At least one embodiment of the invention makes it possible to display a screen of an application desired by a user quickly.

The invention will be described herein with reference to illustrative embodiments. Those skilled in the art will recognize that many alternative embodiments can be accomplished using the teachings of the present invention and that the invention is not limited to the embodiments illustrated for explanatory purposes.

It is to be noted that in the explanation of the drawings the same components are given the same reference numerals and explanations are not repeated.

A boot control unit is a function implemented by a program such as an operation system OS performed by the system. The boot control unit may control screen display for the applications. The boot control unit may control the screen display for the applications registered in an application management table See . The boot control unit may operate in the energy saving mode.

 The operation panel is turned on when a user does an operation to trigger transition to a standby mode i.e. an operation mode in which the user may use functions of the image forming apparatus . The operation panel may transmit a ready to display notification to the boot control unit . The notification indicates that the display is ready to show the screen for the applications.

 After the boot control unit detects by receiving the ready to display notification that the operation panel is ready to show a screen the boot control unit may transmit an application selection screen to the operation panel . The application selection screen is used by the user to select one of the applications registered in the application management table .

The boot control unit which has transmitted the application selection screen to the operation panel may transmit the ready to display notification to applications 1 3 in response to the ready to display notification from the operation panel . The applications 1 3 start to create UI screens depending on each application.

In this way the operation panel displays the application selection screen before the applications 1 3 create UI screens so that the user may feel a duration to wait to operate the image forming apparatus is reduced.

 When the user selects the application 1 on the application selection screen the boot control unit stores information indicating the application 1 is selected. By storing the information representing that the application 1 is selected even if the application 1 has not yet created a UI screen after the application 1 was selected the boot control unit may transmit the UI screen to the operation panel after the application 1 finishes creating the UI screen.

 The application 1 transmits a response to the ready to display notification to the boot control unit when the application 1 becomes ready to display the UI screen. The boot control unit detects the response transmitted by the application 1 indicated in the information representing that the application 1 is selected and transmits the UI screen for the application 1 to the operation panel . In this way the UI screen for the application 1 may be displayed just after the application 1 selected by the user is ready to display the UI screen. In addition the applications 2 3 transmit the response to the ready to display notification to the boot control unit when the applications 2 3 become ready to display respective UI screens.

The image forming apparatus according to the present embodiment may smoothly display the UI screen when the image forming apparatus resumes from the energy saving mode as well as when the image forming apparatus boots e.g. when the main power is turned on or the power of the CPU is turned on .

 When the main power is turned on the boot control unit is started and the operation panel is turned on. Since static information about the application management table is stored in a non volatile memory while the main power is off the boot control unit may access the application management table just after the start up even if the applications are not started. The boot control unit which is started receives the ready to display notification from the operation panel .

 the image forming apparatus starts the applications after starting the OS. After the boot control unit receives the ready to display notification from the operation panel the boot control unit transmits the application selection screen to the operation panel regardless of startup statuses of the applications. Because the operation panel may display an application selection screen even if the applications have not started the user may feel that wait time is reduced. The boot control unit transmits the ready to display notification to the applications which are started.

 When the user selects the application 1 on the application selection screen the boot control unit stores information indicating the application 1 is selected. By storing the information representing that the application 1 is selected even if the application 1 has yet not created a UI screen after the application was selected the boot control unit may transmit the UI screen to the operation panel after the application 1 finishes creating the UI screen.

 The application 1 transmits a response to the ready to display notification to the boot control unit when the application 1 becomes ready to display the UI screen. The boot control unit detects the response transmitted by the application 1 indicated in the information representing that the application 1 is selected and transmits the UI screen for the application 1 to the operation panel . The operation panel displays the UI screen for the application 1. In this way the UI screen for the application 1 may be displayed just after the application 1 selected by the user is ready to display the UI screen.

In this way the image forming apparatus according to this embodiment may reduce the waiting time for the user by displaying the application selection screen regardless of the startup statuses of the applications. In addition as the image forming apparatus stores information about the application the user selected the image forming apparatus may display without user s selection the UI screen for the selected application when the selected application transmits the response to the ready to display notification. Thus for any applications the waiting time from when the user selected the application to when the UI screen is displayed may be reduced to be less than that when a prioritized application is set. Their waiting times cannot be compared strictly because the prioritized application is not configured and the application selection screen is displayed in this embodiment. Provided that the user selected the prioritized application the waiting time is the same but provided that the user selected a non prioritized application the waiting time is shorter in this embodiment. 

The scanner optically reads a copy placed on a contact glass or an auto document feeder ADF with a line sensor including a CCD. In the CCD light having passed through a color filter RGB is processed by photoelectric conversion and then image data with color reflecting contrasting density of the copy in a predetermined resolution is created. After image processing the image data is stored on a main memory on the controller side and used by the plotter to output the image data on paper or by the FAX engine to transmit the image data via a telephone line. In addition the image data may be transmitted from an external interface not shown in to other devices.

The plotter prints the image data stored in the main memory on recording media such as paper. The plotter may operate as an image forming unit including a photoreceptor an electrifier a lithographic exposure unit a development counter a cleaning unit a static eliminator a transfer belt a paper path structure a fuser a paper feed tray a copy receiving tray etc. Alternatively the image forming unit may employ an ink jet printing system instead of such an electrophotography system. There are two systems for the plotter which employs the electrophotography system. One is a tandem system preparing photoreceptors for colors CMYK and the other is a four cycle system in which toner images with four colors are transferred on an intermediate transfer unit and then the superposed toner image is transferred on paper at once.

An image processing ASIC performs image processing on the image data scanned by the scanner and outputs the image data to a main controller . The image processing ASIC performs modification to the image data scanned by the scanner according to a characteristic difference of the scanner CCD. For example the image processing ASIC may perform shading a gamma conversion a filter processing a color conversion RGB to RGB etc. Due to that modification the same image data is created regardless of the difference of the scanner .

In addition the image processing ASIC may perform image processing which causes the plotter to print the image data conveyed from the main controller and transmit the image data corresponding to the print timing of the plotter . For example the image processing ASIC may perform a skew correction a doubling process for density a jaggy correction a trimming process and a pattern creation such as a tint block for the image data. In addition such modification processes may be performed for each image data CMYK . The image processing ASIC transmits each image data at different timing.

At the controller side the operation panel a hard disk drive HDD and the main memory are connected to the main controller . Here functions which are not used for main characterizing portions in this embodiment are omitted.

The main controller may perform using the main memory rotation or modification for the image data used in the image forming apparatus . In addition the main controller may store the image data in the HDD and exchange the image data with the image processing ASIC . The main controller has additional CPUs in addition to a main CPU which controls the image forming apparatus .

The main memory may provide a work area in which programs for controlling the image forming apparatus are extracted and a temporal storage area e.g. image memory for the image data.

The operation panel has a touch panel display unit such as a liquid crystal display. The operation panel may display many kinds of screens a status of the image forming apparatus and a job history. In addition the operation panel may provide a user interface for accepting user operations. Furthermore the operation panel has hardware keys such as a start button and a numeric keypad.

The HDD may store font data platform data including the OS programs for the applications and programs providing functions as described later. The HDD may be used to store a printer description language PDL .

The main controller has a main CPU modules hereinafter called module A B an operation panel interface a ROM a sub CPU a HDD interface a PCI interface an interruption controller and a DDR controller which are connected with a bus. Hereinafter each unit may be called just block regardless of a kind of the unit.

The main CPU totally controls the image forming apparatus including the controller side and the engine side. For example in response to a user operation on the operation panel the main CPU may execute a job such as copying printing or scanning. When the main CPU receives PDL data from a PC via a network interface not shown the main CPU analyzes the PDL data and performs a printing job.

The operation panel interface operates as an interface between the operation panel and the main CPU . The operation panel interface transmits various screens e.g. an application selection screen and a UI screen to the operation panel to display them. For example the UI screen shows a configuration menu indicating conditions for job execution and a software keyboard. When the operation panel receives a user operation for the conditions and transmits a notification to the operation panel interface the operation panel interface updates the screen. The operation panel interface conveys the final conditions to the main CPU .

The modules A B are examples of general purpose functional blocks operating as an interface unit for detecting an interruption causing the image forming apparatus to resume from the energy saving mode or another specific functional unit. For example the specific functional unit includes a USB interface for a movable storage medium such as a USB memory a network card interface an ADF controller and an image processing module for rotation or modification.

The operation panel interface and the modules A B are directly connected with an interruption controller . The interruption controller has a register in which an element corresponding to an interrupting block turns on. The interruption controller transmits a notification indicating a content of the interruption to the sub CPU according to the interrupting block.

The sub CPU controls mode transition for energy savings. For example the sub CPU accepts a notification from a timer indicating that a certain time has lapsed or the sub CPU detects that conditions are met for the mode transition for energy saving at an operation mode and the sub CPU changes statuses of the blocks so as to transition to another operation mode. When resuming from the operation mode for energy saving the sub CPU changes the statuses of the blocks so as to transition to an operation mode corresponding to a case of resuming from the operation mode for energy saving. The sub CPU is always turned on except for special models of image forming apparatuses and the sub CPU performs the process to resume from the operation mode for energy saving when the sub CPU detects the cause.

The HDD interface is an interface for the HDD . The PCI interface is an interface for communicating with the image processing ASIC an engine by PCI Express bus. The HDD stores programs . The programs are stored in recording media in advance. Alternatively the programs may be downloaded and distributed from a server not shown .

The DDR controller may provide a write function to the main memory and a read function from the main memory . In the write function the DDR controller writes data obtained from a peripheral device directed by the CPU into an address in the main memory . In the read function the DDR controller reads the data from the address in the main memory directed by the CPU .

The main CPU OFF mode has various kinds of statuses. For example the sub CPU may become either ON or OFF in the main CPU OFF mode depending on the model or user configuration of the image forming apparatus . In addition the main CPU is OFF while the main power is turned off. Furthermore when the main CPU is OFF the main memory may become either ON or OFF. When the main memory is ON that state is called suspend to RAM STR mode. In the STR mode CPU register statuses are saved in the main memory and other blocks are turned off as much as possible. When the image forming apparatus resumes from the STR mode the CPU reads the register statuses stored in the main memory so that the OS and applications need not be rebooted and wait time may be reduced.

In the main CPU OFF mode according to this embodiment the main CPU is OFF. For ease of explanation regardless of states in the main CPU OFF mode transition from the main CPU OFF mode to the standby mode is called startup and transition from the energy saving mode to the standby mode is called resume .

Power key ON Disabling energy saving key ON Film platen close to open Document feeder DF copy set detected

It is determined in advance whether the image forming apparatus transitions from the silent mode to either the energy saving mode or the main CPU OFF mode. In addition a transition from the energy saving mode to the main CPU OFF mode is not performed depending on the image forming apparatus or the content of the main CPU OFF mode.

The combined machine booting unit is executed when the main power of the image forming apparatus is turned on and causes the platform layer and the application layer to start. The combined machine booting unit may be implemented as a BIOS a bootstrap loader and an OS loader provided by the OS and the combined machine booting unit may start the platform layer in a predetermined order. The combined machine booting unit may specify an application to be started by referring to a configuration file as explained below and start each application in the application layer .

The platform includes a control service which is divided into some units a system resource manager SRM and the OS . The control service interprets a request from the application via an application programming interface and issues a request to acquire hardware sources. The SRM manages the hardware resources and adjusts the request from the control service . The OS may be a general purpose operating system such as UNIX R and Linux R . The OS executes each software program in the platform layer and the application layer as a process in parallel.

The control service has a plurality of service modules including a system control service SCS an engine control service ECS a memory control service MCS an operation panel control service OCS a fax control service FCS and a network control service NCS .

The MCS is a process which controls the main memory . The MCS controls allocation and re allocation for the image memory using the HDD . The OCS controls the operation panel . The FCS controls transmission or receipt of facsimile data. The NCS is a process providing communications via a network interface. The NCS transmits and receives data according to a communication protocol. In particular the NCS distributes received data for each application and transmits data that the application has requested to send to the network. The ECS controls the hardware resources such as the plotter the scanner the facsimile etc.

The SRM controls the whole system and manages resources with the SCS . The SRM manages a request to the engine the plotter the scanner etc. the main memory the HDD and other hardware resources and bridges services. In particular the SRM determines whether the hardware resource requested is available and if so the SRM tells the upper layer the requested resource is available. In addition the SRM performs scheduling for the hardware resources in response to a request from the upper layer and issues a control request to the hardware.

The SCS performs application management control of the operation unit including operations of hardware keys except the operations panel displaying a system screen displaying LED and resource management. The boot control unit controls functions provided by the SCS and the OCS regarding display screens for the application. The boot control unit displays the application selection screen and the UI screen on start up or resume of the image forming apparatus.

The application layer includes the above stated applications 1 3. For example the applications include a printer application a copy application a fax application a scanner application a document box application and a Web application . The printer application has a RPDL PCL and Post Script PS module for interpreting each page description language. The copy application accepts an execution condition for a copy job and displays copy result and job execution history. The fax application accepts a condition for transmitting a fax and displays transmission result and history. The scanner application accepts a condition for scanning paper and displays scanning result. The document box application accepts an instruction to display and print and transmit a document stored in the HDD . The Web application has a function for a browser to access and display a web page according to URL input.

The above applications are started as a process like the application of the platform layer . Each application has a unique UI screen and the boot control unit displays the UI screen on the operation panel .

The boot control unit starts at least earlier than the applications. The boot control unit is always started when the main CPU is turned on. The boot control unit includes a display control unit an application selection screen generating unit a selection storing unit a determination unit and a notification order setting unit . The display control unit controls the application UI screen to be displayed on the operation panel on startup or resumption of the image forming apparatus . The application selection screen generating unit creates an application selection screen. The selection storing unit keeps information representing an application selected by the user which is transmitted by the operation panel . The determination unit determines that the information representing the selected application corresponds with an application transmitting a response to a ready to display notification. The notification order setting unit sets or accepts a setting of an order for transmitting the ready to display notification.

The boot control unit refers to the configuration file and creates an application management table responding to a notification from the combined machine booting unit . Static data included in the application management table originally created may be stored in the ROM . The application management table includes all of the applications for which the screen has to be managed regardless of whether the application has been started or not.

In this embodiment duration time for displaying an application UI screen used by a user may be reduced by employing a small number as the notification order for a frequently used application.

When the selection screen field in the application management table is updated the notification order setting unit updates the notification order field so that applications to be displayed may preferentially receive the ready to display notification. For example the notification order setting unit may set the last notification order for the application removed from the application selection screen by the user. In addition the notification order setting unit may move forward notification order of applications which has been later than the removed application. Furthermore the notification order setting unit may set the last notification order in displayed application for the application newly added to the application selection screen by the user The notification order setting unit may move backward notification order of the application not to be shown. In this way the boot control unit may preferentially transmit the ready to display notification to the application shown in the application selection screen.

S The operation panel which is turned on transmits a ready to display notification to the boot control unit .

S Since the application 1 is the prioritized application the boot control unit transmits a ready to display notification to the application 1. Since the boot control unit transmits to the application 1 which is displayed first the notification in advance i.e. the boot control unit delays transmission of notifications to other applications waiting time for user operations is reduced.

S When the application has started the application 1 transmits to the boot control unit a response to the ready to display notification

S The boot control unit detects by receiving the response to the ready to display notification that the application 1 is ready to display the UI screen and the boot control unit displays the UI screen of the application 1 on the operation panel . Thus the UI screen of the application 1 may be displayed in a short time.

S After displaying the UI screen of the prioritized application the boot control unit transmits ready to display notifications to other applications. In the boot control unit transmits the ready to display notification to the application 3.

S The application 3 transmits to the boot control unit a response to the ready to display notification.

S The application 2 transmits to the boot control unit a response to the ready to display notification.

In this way the UI screen of the prioritized application 1 is displayed first. However when the user selects the application 2 or 3 the UI screen of the application 1 is being displayed. Thus regarding the application 2 or 3 i.e. non prioritized application waiting time is likely to increase.

S The operation panel which has been turned on transmits a ready to display notification to the boot control unit . The ready to display notification means that the operation panel is ready to display a screen for the application as well as that the operation panel has been turned on and requests the screen for the application.

S When the display control unit receives the ready to display notification from the operation panel in order to transmit the application selection screen the display control unit causes the application selection screen generating unit to create the application selection screen. The application selection screen generating unit refers to the selection screen field in the application management table identifies applications to be displayed on the application selection screen determines their positions and creates the application selection screen.

S Since the boot control unit transmits the application selection screen to the operation panel the operation panel displays the application selection screen. In this way since the boot control unit displays the application selection screen as soon as possible the user is likely to feel that starting up of the image forming apparatus is quick or waiting time is short .

S The display control unit refers to the notification order field in the application management table and transmits ready to display notifications to the applications in order. First the display control unit transmits the notification to the application 1. In particular the display control unit may include the ready to display notification in an argument to call the application 1. The ready to display notification is stored in a stack area so that the application 1 may obtain the ready to display notification.

S The operation panel transmits information representing that the application 1 is selected to the boot control unit .

S When the boot control unit receives the information representing that the application 1 is selected the display control unit causes the selection storing unit to store the information representing that the application 1 is selected.

S The applications 1 3 which have received the ready to display notifications create or prepare for creating UI screens. However the order to finish creating the UI screens does not depend on the order to have received the ready to display notifications. This is because the order is affected by time to switch controls for each application or performance of each application. Thus the applications 1 3 transmit responses to the ready to display notifications to the boot control unit after completing creation or preparation for creation of the UI screens. In the application 3 first transmits the response to the ready to display notification to the boot control unit .

S The display control unit registers the application which has transmitted the response to the ready to display notification in the response to ready to display notification field in the application management table . Thus the response to ready to display notification field for the application 3 which has transmitted the response to ready to display notification becomes received .

S The determining unit determines whether the application indicated in the information representing the application 1 is selected which is stored by the selection storing unit when the response to the ready to display notification is received is identical with the application which has transmitted the response to the ready to display notification. If so the determining unit transmits the UI screen of the application. At the S the determining unit determines that both applications are not identical because the information representing the application 1 is selected indicates the application 1 but the application 3 has transmitted the response to the ready to display notification.

S The application 1 transmits a response to the ready to display notification to the boot control unit .

S The display control unit registers the application 1 which has transmitted the response to the ready to display notification to the response to ready to display notification field in the application management table .

S The determining unit determines whether the application indicated in the information representing the application 1 is selected which is stored by the selection storing unit when the response to the ready to display notification is received is identical with the application which has transmitted the response to the ready to display notification. At the S the determining unit determines that both applications are identical because the information representing the application 1 is selected indicates the application 1 and the application 1 has transmitted the response to the ready to display notification.

S Since the determining unit determines both application are identical the display control unit displays the UI screen of the application 1 on the operation panel . Thus the operation panel may display the UI screen of the application 1 soon after the application 1 finishes preparing the UI screen.

S The application 2 transmits a response to the ready to display notification to the boot control unit . The subsequent steps are in common with the application 3.

In this way the image forming apparatus in this embodiment may display the application selection screen soon after the resumption and the user is likely to feel that waiting time is short. In addition since the image forming apparatus remembers which application is selected by the user even if the application is not ready to display the UI screen when the user have selected the application the image forming apparatus may display the UI screen of the application selected by the user soon after the application is ready to display the UI screen. The user need not select the application again until the application is ready to display the UI screen.

Next a sequence is explained when timing of user s selection is different from the above case. is a sequence chart illustrating an alternative process performed by the image forming apparatus to display a UI screen of an application. The difference may be mainly discussed for the similar steps as shown in . In it is assumed that the notification order registered in the application management table is 1 for the application 3 2 for the application 2 and 3 for the application 1. Here the image forming apparatus is in the energy saving mode.

S The operation panel which has been turned on transmits a ready to display notification to the boot control unit .

S When the display control unit receives the ready to display notification from the operation panel in order to transmit the application selection screen the display control unit causes the application selection screen generating unit to create the application selection screen. The application selection screen generating unit refers to the selection screen field in the application management table identifies applications to be displayed on the application selection screen determines the their positions and creates the application selection screen.

S Since the boot control unit transmits the application selection screen to the operation panel the operation panel displays the application selection screen. In this way since the boot control unit displays the application selection screen as soon as possible the user is likely to feel that starting up of the image forming apparatus is quick or waiting time is short .

S The display control unit refers to the notification order field in the application management table and transmits ready to display notifications to the applications in order. First the display control unit transmits the notification to the application 3.

S The operation panel transmits information representing the application 1 is selected to the boot control unit .

S When the boot control unit receives the information representing the application 1 is selected the display control unit causes the selection storing unit to store the information representing the application 1 is selected.

S Since the application 1 is selected the display control unit prepares the UI screen of the application 1 preferentially. When the display control unit receives information representing the application 1 is selected before transmitting the ready to display notification to all of the applications the display control unit causes the application 1 to create the UI screen. Therefore although the notification order in the application management table indicates the application 3 the application 2 and the application 1 in order the display control unit gives higher priority to the application 1 than the application 2.

S The application 3 which has received the ready to display notification creates or prepares to create the UI screen and transmits a response to the ready to display notification to the boot control unit .

S The display control unit registers the application which has transmitted the response to the ready to display notification in the response to ready to display notification field in the application management table . Thus the response to ready to display notification field for the application 3 which has transmitted the response to ready to display notification becomes received .

S The determining unit determines whether the application indicated in the information representing the application 1 is selected which is stored by the selection storing unit when the response to the ready to display notification is received is identical with the application which has transmitted the response to the ready to display notification. If so the determining unit transmits the UI screen of the application. At the S the determining unit determines that both applications are not identical because the information representing the application 1 is selected indicates the application 1 but the application 3 has transmitted the response to the ready to display notification.

S The application 1 transmits a response to the ready to display notification to the boot control unit .

S The display control unit registers the application 1 which has transmitted the response to the ready to display notification to the response to ready to display notification field in the application management table .

S The determining unit determines whether the application indicated in the information representing the application 1 is selected which is stored by the selection storing unit when the response to the ready to display notification is received is identical with the application which has transmitted the response to the ready to display notification. At the S the determining unit determines that both applications are identical because the information representing the application 1 is selected indicates the application 1 and the application 1 has transmitted the response to the ready to display notification.

S The display control unit displays the UI screen of the application 1 on the operation panel . Thus the operation panel may display the UI screen of the application 1 soon after the application 1 finishes preparing the UI screen.

S Next the display control unit transmits a ready to display notification to the application 2. Thus the display control unit transmits the notification to the application 2 which has not received the notification after displaying the UI screen of the prioritized application 1.

S The application 2 transmits a response to the ready to display notification to the boot control unit . The subsequent steps are in common with the application 3.

In this way the image forming apparatus in this embodiment may display the application selection screen soon after the resumption like the sequence as shown in . In addition since the UI screen of the application selected by the user may be created first regardless of the notification order when the user selects the application in advance the UI screen of the selected application may be displayed first.

In both cases shown in the application 1 transmits the response to the ready to display notification later than the user s selection of the application. However the user may select the application 1 after the application has transmitted the response to the ready to display notification. Also in this case since the Response to a ready to display notification field for the application 1 indicates received soon after the user selects the application 1 the display control unit may display the UI screen of the application 1 on the operation panel .

In this embodiment waiting time to display the UI screen of the application used by the user may be reduced after the main power of the image forming apparatus is turned on.

S When the image forming apparatus starts the operation panel is turned on. In addition the platform layer including the OS starts before the applications 1 3.

S The operation panel which has been turned on transmits a ready to display notification to the boot control unit .

S When the display control unit receives the ready to display notification from the operation panel in order to transmit the application selection screen the display control unit causes the application selection screen generating unit to create the application selection screen. The application selection screen generating unit refers to the selection screen field in the application management table identifies applications to be displayed on the application selection screen determines the their positions and creates the application selection screen.

S Since the boot control unit transmits the application selection screen to the operation panel the operation panel displays the application selection screen. In this way since the boot control unit displays the application selection screen as soon as possible the user is likely to feel that the image forming apparatus starts quickly or waiting time is short .

S The operation panel transmits information representing that the application 1 is selected to the boot control unit .

S When the boot control unit receives the information representing that the application 1 is selected the display control unit causes the selection storing unit to store the information representing that the application 1 is selected. However since not any of the applications 1 3 have started yet the boot control unit may not transmit ready to display notifications. In this case the boot control unit may wait for start up of the application 1 selected by the user. The start up may be detected by the start flag . In addition even if the applications 2 3 have started in advance the boot control unit does not transmit the ready to display notifications in order to give priority to the application 1.

S As shown in when the application 1 starts since the combined machine booting unit registers its start up in the application management table start flag turns to the boot control unit may detect that the application 1 starts.

S The display control unit loads information representing that the application 1 is selected which is stored in the selection storing unit and prepares the UI screen of the application 1 preferentially. Thus the control unit gives priority to the application 1 than the applications 2 3 regardless of the notification order . The application 1 which receives a ready to display notification creates or prepares to create the UI screen.

S The application 1 transmits a response to the ready to display notification to the boot control unit .

S The display control unit registers the application 1 which has transmitted the response to the ready to display notification in the response to ready to display notification field in the application management table . Thus the response to ready to display notification field for the application 1 which has transmitted the response to ready to display notification becomes received .

S The determining unit determines that the application indicated in the information representing that the application 1 is selected which is stored by the selection storing unit when the response to the ready to display notification is received is identical with the application which has transmitted the response to the ready to display notification. At the S the determining unit determines that both applications are identical because the information representing that the application 1 is selected indicates the application 1 and the application 1 has transmitted the response to the ready to display notification.

S The boot control unit displays the UI screen of the application 1 on the operation panel . Thus the display control unit may display the UI screen of the application 1 soon after the application 1 finishes preparing the UI screen. After that the boot control unit transmits ready to display notifications to the applications 2 3.

Since the application selection screen may be displayed even if the application has not started the user is likely to feel that waiting time is short. In addition the image forming apparatus keeps before the application starts information representing the application selected by the user. Thus even if the application is not ready to display the UI screen when the user selects the application just after the application is ready to display the UI screen the image forming apparatus may display the UI screen of the application selected by the user. The user need not select the application again until the application is ready to display the UI screen.

In this embodiment the image forming system is explained which may control the UI screen of the applications in common with the first embodiment except that the operation panel is a movable device.

The terminal is preferably an information processing apparatus including a display device such as a tablet a smartphone a personal digital assistant PDA a mobile phone etc. The image forming apparatus may display the application selection screen and the UI screen on the display device.

In particular when the user who is carrying the terminal approaches a location where the image forming apparatus is placed the image forming apparatus may detect that with wireless communications started automatically or in response to an explicit operation by the user. The user operates the terminal while the user places the terminal on a predetermined position of the image forming apparatus or holds the terminal in hand when no place is provided.

When the image forming apparatus may communicate with the terminal the image forming apparatus transmits a screen to the terminal . In this case the image forming apparatus may not transmit the screen to the operation panel . When the image forming apparatus transmits the screen to the terminal the image forming apparatus accepts operations performed on the terminal preferentially.

Thus the user may operate the terminal as is the case in using the operation panel . The image forming apparatus may resume or start in a way similar to that of the first embodiment. However in this embodiment the image forming apparatus may resume operations in response to the communication with the terminal .

The image forming apparatus which has resumed or started estimates a connection with the terminal automatically or in response to the user operation. After that as is the case in the operation panel the image forming apparatus displays an application selection screen and a UI screen and may receive information representing which application the user selected.

That is after estimation of the connection the transmission unit of the terminal transmits a ready to display notification to the image forming apparatus . The image forming apparatus transmits the application selection screen to the terminal .

The receiving unit of the terminal receives the application selection screen and the display unit displays the application selection screen. After that when the user selects an application at any time the transmission unit transmits to the image forming apparatus the information representing which application is selected.

The image forming apparatus holds the information representing which application is selected by the user. When the selected application outputs a response to the ready to display notification the image forming apparatus transmits a UI screen of the application to the terminal . The receiving unit of the terminal receives the UI screen and the display unit displays the UI screen.

In this way the terminal communicates with the image forming apparatus and may display the UI screen of the image forming apparatus .

The present application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority of Japanese Patent Application No. 2012 281304 filed on Dec. 25 2012 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
