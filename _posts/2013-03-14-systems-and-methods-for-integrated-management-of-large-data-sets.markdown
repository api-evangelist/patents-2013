title: Systems and methods for integrated management of large data sets
abstract: Systems, methods and techniques for managing data sets are described. In particular, systems and methods for modeling, representing, acquiring and disseminating large data sets and data files using metadata are described. The large data sets may include geospatial information. The metadata may be extracted from the data or provided separately. Such metadata may be used to represent the underlying data so as to avoid unnecessary and/or unwanted transfer, exposure or manipulation of the underlying data. The metadata may be represented in a static or dynamic fashion, and may be shared via, for example, social media networks and the like.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 740 373 filed Dec. 20 2012 which application is incorporated herein by reference.

As geographic information systems GIS and associated technologies such as geospatial analysis increase in scope and complexity the amount of data used therewith and generated therefrom grows at an astounding rate. The proportion of information sensing devices and methodologies generating computer readable geospatial data continues to increase as does the general connectivity of such devices and methodologies. As a result the amount and complexity of data representing a given geographic concept also tends to increase over time thus accelerating the overall growth in the size and complexity of data sets across diverse applications including GIS applications. However the ability to process big data as such ponderously large and complex data sets are commonly known is often limited by both time and computing resource constraints. These collective limitations constitute the fundamental problem underlying big data and are particularly relevant to continuing innovation in GIS.

Methodologies for mitigating such constraints are in continuous development. For example network connected distributed computing systems known as cloud computing systems provide scalable massively parallelized and aggregated compute resources such as databases disk storage processing capability and the like. Cloud computing systems provide e.g. geospatial data providers access to considerably greater computing resources than they might otherwise be able to privately procure and or administer thus providing for the use storage and manipulation of big data associated therewith to a far greater population of users with limited local resources.

However cloud computing is by its nature a brute force solution for dealing with the sheer scale of big data. Other logistical issues such as the length of time involved in getting the data into and out of a cloud computing system in the first instance generally remain and become increasingly important as emerging technologies and collaboration models such as social networks crowdsourcing and the like enable greater numbers of e.g. non institutional users to participate in the creation management and dissemination of the concepts underlying the data as well as the data itself . Additionally as the scope of geospatial data generation grows broader over time the number of disparate data formats and types between data sets and at times within a given data set increases.

All publications patents and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication patent or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.

Techniques described suggested and implied herein include systems and methods for storing accessing sharing and otherwise managing geospatial or other types of data files using a data management system. For purposes of this application the terms geospatial and geographic are used interchangeably. In some embodiments a data management system may employ metadata extraction and or data modeling schemes to complex or very large data files or sets or supersets of data files so as to ease the handling processing and dissemination of the data. The term metadata as used herein refers to any data or content derived or derivable from other data or content including both structural metadata and descriptive metadata. Examples include data or content regarding the means of creation intended purpose origin location in any sense including relative absolute topological virtual or geographical and or structure of other data or content. The data management system may be implemented as a layer between a geospatial data provider or other type of data provider and a distributed computing service provider and by using one or more metadata extraction and or data modeling schemes provide the data provider with an efficient compact representation of its geospatial or other data holdings as well as pass through the well known advantages of storing data via a distributed computing service such as scalability economy ubiquity of access reliability and the like. Such techniques may also include one or more facilities for streamlining the processing of a data provider s data holdings by decreasing the local resources necessary to do so. The data management system may expose user account functionality to data providers in order to for example control access to the data by employees clients or others. The term data provider refers to any entity that provides data including but not limited to servers systems users data creators or the like as well as any constituents related thereto e.g. users of such systems and or employees of such data creators .

In another example described herein metadata derived stored and or acquired by the data management system may be employed as the basis of presentation dissemination marketing and similar activities related to the underlying data. For example metadata set s derived from geospatial data may be visually represented e.g. on a map and or in an aggregated format for a given extent such that users may differentiate and or select from the associated geospatial data set s based on the visual representation of the metadata. As another example visually represented metadata may be shared between users e.g. via social networks email and the like so that the associated data set s themselves need not be moved or transferred. Thus the sharing of metadata set s may in some embodiments be agnostic and independent of changes to the underlying data set s . Any combination of elements within such metadata set s may in some embodiments be visually represented with different combinations or subcombinations shown depending on context user preference etc. The metadata set s and or the visual representation thereof may be augmented or supplanted by third parties. For example one or more visual representation s of the metadata set s may include facilities whereby third parties such as data providers may directly provide to augment the visual representation additional content relevant to the data being represented. Additionally the actions associated with sharing metadata set s via e.g. social networks email and the like may be tracked by the data management system so as to internally develop a network representing relationships between users.

The one or more data provider s are in some embodiments providers of raw and or preprocessed geospatial data and may be connected to the data management system in any suitable fashion. In embodiments where the data management system is dispersed or implemented as e.g. a virtual instance provided by the distributed computing resource provider the data provider may connect directly to the distributed computing resource provider in any suitable manner. Thus it is contemplated that the concepts described herein including those associated with the data management system may be conceptual rather than physical. Data providers may in some embodiments also provide metadata associated with the data either inherent to the data or as separate metadata sets. While the techniques disclosed herein are described as applied to geospatial data it is contemplated that in some embodiments the data management system is capable of accepting and or manipulating data of any kind and is not necessarily limited to geospatial or similar applications. The disclosed technique s may be applied in for any data type abstraction application size complexity or the like to improve data archival and retrieval for applications where the nature of the utilized data presents difficulties in data representation data mobility or other considerations described herein. Examples of such applications include but are not limited to those found in the pharmaceutical bioinformatics life and physical sciences including biosciences medical devices information technology science and or data archival industries. The flexibility of application of the disclosed techniques is in some embodiments enabled at least in part due to modular nature of the systems methods and frameworks described herein including techniques described in more detail below that allow third parties to at least partially provide or augment the representations e.g. metadata representations of their data with relevant content of their choosing metadata metadata derived from metadata or otherwise .

Upon receiving or otherwise associating with data from the data provider s the data management system performs one or more functions upon or related to the data including metadata extraction data modeling forwarding or mirroring of the data for storage on one or more resources of the distributed computing resource provider processing or reprocessing e.g. from raw data into a standard file format or between file formats representing the data in a way that is conducive to end user consumption and the like. Exemplary functions including but not limited to the functions just mentioned will be described in more detail herein.

One or more users may in some embodiments be associated with data provider s and access data provided therefrom via the data management system . Again in some embodiments the public users may be connected to one or both of the data provider s and or the data management system and or the distributed computing resource provider as applicable in any appropriate manner. Such users may for example be employees of the data provider s or in some embodiments may be public users that have been authorized by techniques disclosed herein by the data provider s to access data provided in connection therewith. Some or all of the users may have access to the data and or metadata via one or more functions of the data management system. In some embodiments such access may be controlled via one or more functions of the data management system by for example an administrator or other entity associated with the data provider.

In some embodiments a data ingestor interfaces with a metadata engine and a front end interface to form a data management layer between one or more data providers and the distributed computing system including the externalized computing resources . The data ingestor may in some embodiments provide initial direction of data entering the data management system from e.g. a data provider. For example one or more workstations of the data provider may have a local application installed thereupon. The local application may track one or more file folders or directories on the workstation s and upon detecting a new data file placed in the tracked directory initiate a push of the new data to the data ingestor. In some embodiments users of the workstation may manually initiate a data upload via the application. Upon receiving the uploaded data or in some embodiments in parallel with an ongoing upload the data ingestor may then initiate an asynchronous task to be executed by the metadata engine wherein the uploaded data is analyzed for relevant metadata which is then extracted and stored within the metadata catalog and associated with e.g. linked to the uploaded data. In some embodiments the data ingestor itself may provide an initial metadata extraction pass to discern sufficient data to create an entry in the metadata catalog for the file in parallel or asynchronously with a more extensive extraction performed by the metadata engine. In some embodiments the data ingestor initiates asynchronously with the metadata extraction task a storage task such that the uploaded file is stored upon the data storage system for future retrieval upon request. It is contemplated that other methods for uploading data may be made available to the data provider such as through facilities exposed through the front end interface. In some embodiments data may be manually uploaded through the data ingestor by e.g. administrators of the data management system for example when physical media such as hard disk drives containing extremely large data files are physically provided to the data management system administrators by the data provider e.g. in cases where the sensitivity size or complexity of the data desired to be uploaded is not conducive to upload via an Internet or other network link . In some embodiments the upload may be effected through an API or web service exposed to e.g. data providers. In some embodiments the data ingestor as with other components of the data management system may be implemented by integrated with and or co located with the data provider. In some embodiments the upload may be effectuated via the front end interface as will be described in more detail below.

The metadata engine is in some embodiments responsible for extracting associating and storing metadata associated with data entering the system via e.g. the data ingestor . As previously described an initial determination of essential metadata such as upload date time user name associated with the upload and or file name may be made so as to create e.g. a database entry for the data file. Also as previously described such actions may be taken by the data ingestor or in some embodiments all metadata related functionality may be performed by a dedicated metadata engine. In some embodiments the metadata engine and or metadata related functionality may be integrated into the operations of the data provider e.g. metadata engine components or functionality may be collocated with the data provider or implemented separately and or remotely from the data provider e.g. using the externalized computing resources previously described upon which some or all of the data management system is implemented . The metadata engine may then extract differing amounts of metadata depending on the nature of the data file s or data set s . For example if the metadata engine is configured to target or prefer specific types of geospatial data formats it may be able to extract a greater breadth or depth of metadata for incoming data of the targeted or preferred types. In some embodiments the file type specific metadata may be required by or relevant to a standard. One example of such a standard in the geospatial context is ISO 19115 which defines a best practice for metadata collection and retention for geospatial data. File formats compliant with the ISO 19115 standard may include metadata required by ISO 19115 in some embodiments the metadata engine is configured to detect when such standards compliant file formats are uploaded so as to accurately extract and model the additional or required metadata. In some embodiments the metadata engine may be configurable to generate a different overall model or schema for each of a plurality of data formats. In some embodiments extracted metadata may be tiered or hierarchical for multiple abstraction levels of data. For example the metadata engine may be configured to extract a given set of metadata associated with data sets or groups of files as well as configured to extract a different set of metadata associated with each file. The term data set s as used herein refers to one or more sets e.g. agglomerations associations or compilations of data elements or files. Such associations may be based on predetermined relationships between the constituent data elements or files e.g. in the case of geospatial data the association between files may be created by the metadata engine based on their geographic proximity thereby creating a data set of such associated data elements or files or may be arbitrarily chosen by e.g. the data provider or system user with or without regard to any relationship between the data elements or files. Such associations may be automatically created by one or more aspects of the data management system such as the metadata engine suggested by one or more aspects of the data management system for selection by a data provider or user e.g. through a user interface or API such as that described in more detail below or defined by e.g. a data provider or user of the data management system through a user interface API or the like. Such associations may be made prior to in connection with or at any time after the upload of the subject data regardless of whether metadata has yet been extracted from the data. In embodiments where associations into data sets have already been made the metadata engine may generate and or extract new metadata if such associations are dissolved and new associations created. As may be contemplated the metadata generated and or extracted may in some embodiments differ in scope or content depending on whether the data requested to be processed by the metadata engine constitutes a single data element or file multiple unassociated data elements or files or data set s as described herein. In the geospatial context a broad data set may have metadata relevant to the entire data set such as minimum and maximum resolution of the data within the data set target geographical feature price and the like. The file level metadata may by contrast include more specific information such as bibliographic information or internal file and upload information. Some types of metadata may be utilized for a plurality of levels such as preview images of the represented data thumbnails digital object identifiers DOIs and or data provenance information e.g. file history ownership prior processing steps and states of the data and the like . In some embodiments hierarchically organized metadata may inherit certain elements from its parent s and or include context information e.g. positioning within the hierarchy related information and or metadata nodes and the like. In some embodiments the metadata engine may generate metadata from or related to other metadata i.e. metadata derived metadata . It is contemplated that each entity associated with the data management system described herein including for example data providers sources geographic locales users accounts and the like may be conceptualized as a data object with associated metadata and such metadata may in some embodiments be utilized as a basis for facilitating the organization of data by way of associations between the metadata associated with the data. One non limiting example may include a data provider with associated metadata identifying the data provider. In this example data uploaded by the data provider may have metadata associated therewith that also identifies the data provider as the source. Similarly data sets created by the data provider using such data may also have metadata associated therewith that identifies the data provider as the source. In such a scenario each construct the data provider the data sets and the data itself may be interlinked within the data management system with the data provider being identifiable as the top level source. In embodiments where each of such constructs is treated as a fungible data object the top level source here the data provider object may be represented as for example an electronic metadata information card as described in more detail below or in any other appropriate representation. Such interlinking and or association between objects may occur at the time of data and or metadata ingestion some time thereafter as a synchronous or asynchronous process or upon the issuance of some trigger such as a search initiated by a user for example the user searching for all holdings sourced from a given data provider. The agglomeration of such data into hierarchically organized constructs may additionally enable the use of higher level agglomerations such as a data provider card as a way to represent manipulate market or otherwise utilize some or all objects associated therewith e.g. hierarchically at or below such an agglomeration .

The metadata engine may in some embodiments provide ways in which metadata associated with data may be imported augmented edited and or exported outside of and or in addition to the extraction techniques described above. For example in some embodiments certain file types containing raw or unformatted data may contain little or no extractable metadata. As another example the metadata contained in the data file may be incorrect or corrupted. Alternatively or in addition a data provider may wish to augment metadata existing with the data file e.g. with comments copyright notices and the like . Any activities related to the metadata information including ingestion updation augmentation association authentication or consistency thereof and or the like may in some embodiments initiate confirmation or other feedback upon commission initiation or completion of such activities using various techniques described or implied herein as well as any appropriate technique known in the art. Such confirmation or other feedback may be generated relayed or otherwise handled using any component described herein and appropriate thereto including the metadata engine itself. The metadata engine may in some embodiments support the importation of extrinsic metadata information via upload of a separate file containing such extrinsic information such as through the data ingestor previously described. In some embodiments extrinsic information may be defined through the front end interface such as in conjunction with a data upload. In some of such embodiments metadata information as well as attendant files containing only such metadata information may be uploaded and processed by the system without any association to a data file or data set stored or to be stored on the system. In these embodiments a link or other identifier identifying the location of an associated data file residing outside of the extant data management system e.g. residing with a third party system may be stored in the metadata catalog. In some embodiments metadata without associations to a data files or data sets may be uploaded but instead may be associated with or point to other types of content. Examples of such content may include links to data provider websites contact phone numbers or external or internal documents e.g. frequently asked questions FAQ pages or other types of reference documents that describe the availability source or provenance of potentially available data or data sets. Such additional content may be exposed using any appropriate technique including using an electronic metadata information card described in more detail herein. It is contemplated that such content may in some embodiments be replaceable with the actual data or data sets at a time at which time one or more associations between the metadata and the data data set s is updated. Some or all of the metadata associated with data files including augmented and extracted metadata may be editable via e.g. the front end interface or in some embodiments via an API or web service. Similarly some or all of the metadata associated with one or more data files or one or more data sets may be packaged as a metadata file by e.g. the metadata engine and in some embodiments provided for download upon request through an API web service and or the front end interface. A metadata file created and downloaded in such a manner may in some embodiments be idempotent if used as an input file of extrinsic information for the data from whence it derived.

As the utility and or effectiveness of many of the concepts and techniques described herein may be heavily dependent on the accuracy of the represented metadata information one or more techniques to verify and or correct user and or data provider provided metadata may be employed. In some embodiments metadata associated with new uploaded data may manually verified e.g. by direct communication between an employee of the data provider and an administrator of the data management system. In some embodiments an automated verification process may be employed. For example if certain metadata is blank or corrupt the data provider may be appropriately notified to enter or correct the metadata e.g. by uploading a file containing new extrinsic metadata information or by entering such data within a UI . Heuristics may also be employed to e.g. ensure consistency and continuity of metadata information between disparate but related files and or within a given file. Any data store catalog or other component handling storing or transacting metadata information may in some embodiments be capable of securing the metadata and the associated data secure from e.g. malicious attacks misappropriation and the like using any appropriate technique known in the art.

Upon population of metadata information within the metadata catalog and association with data stored in data storage system a data provider or employee thereof and or one or more public users which may in some embodiments be similar to the users described in connection with may view all or a subset of the data stored within the data storage system. In some embodiments the metadata associated with the data is presented so as to inform a potential user processor administrator or other potential downloader of the data of the contents thereof. In exemplary embodiments the metadata representative of the data allows e.g. a data provider employee to select based on the metadata only the specific data needed for a given workflow e.g. processing of raw data files . Such selection and subsequent download may be facilitated by the application which may or may not be the same or similar application as the one exemplarily utilized for uploading or pushing and described above. As illustrated in some embodiments the application may query the metadata engine or possibly directly query the metadata catalog for the metadata and its data association s . In some embodiments similar facilities for representing data using associated metadata as well as subsequent selection and or downloading of data e.g. by data providers may be provided through the front end interface as will be discussed in more detail below.

In some embodiments a front end interface provides an externally facing interface for displaying uploading downloading transacting and otherwise manipulating data and metadata managed and or stored by the data management system. Such a front end interface may be utilized by data provider s and or public users . The front end interface may be implemented in any appropriate manner and using any appropriate number or type of components. For example the front end interface may include a Web server programmed to provide a visual UI via the Internet. In some embodiments the front end interface may expose one or more APIs to various components described herein and as previously described. In some embodiments the front end interface may utilize the data ingestor for upload download and manipulation of various data files. Similarly the front end interface may utilize the metadata engine to read write replace modify remove export and or import metadata information including information regarding association with e.g. data stored within the data storage system. In some embodiments the front end interface may directly transact alternatively or additionally with the externalized computing resources such as the data storage system the metadata catalog and or the user catalog using any appropriate technique familiar to those of ordinary skill in the art. It is contemplated that the front end interface or any other component of the data management system capable of external communication may expose metadata information to external data handlers such as search engine indexers spiders to e.g. aid dissemination of the information. For example exposing metadata information to spiders allows for the aggregation and display of the exposed metadata in associated search engine result pages.

In some embodiments the front end interface or any other component of the data management system capable of external communication may enable external entities to query search view transact with or manipulate via the metadata associated therewith or accessible thereto data managed or otherwise associated with the various components of the data management system. In some embodiments the front end interface may offer to external entities access to such metadata and data via API s UIs or in any other appropriate manner. In some embodiments the front end interface enables monetization of such access by e.g. requiring payment for general access to the data management system or data metadata associated therewith per specific search query per access request e.g. pay per click or any other appropriate manner of monetization. In some embodiments the visibility of such metadata and or data to external entities may be increased and or otherwise optimized based on e.g. relevance to the initiating query cost or any other appropriate parameter or combination of parameters. In some embodiments visibility of data and or metadata to external entities may be monetizable by for example enabling sources of the data and or metadata or entities thereto such as data providers to pay for better visibility e.g. higher search positioning on an appropriate basis e.g. pay per click . Other examples include provisions enabled by the front end interface for displaying sponsored links in exchange for monetary considerations from the data provider s where such sponsored link directs an external entity to for example an electronic metadata information card associated with the paying data provider s and displaying some or all of the data associated therewith or any other destination specified by the data provider s .

Access control of e.g. public users or data provider employees may be administered and defined through the front end interface such as via a UI API or web service. Such users may be created through a function of the front end interface including via one or more UIs APIs or web services or may be implicitly or explicitly created by one or more actions of existing users. In an exemplary embodiment various rights levels may be defined by an administrator of the data managements system a designated administrator of for the data provider s or both. Such rights levels which control varying permissions across the data management system including upload download rights visibility of data holdings user creation administration and the like may be freely assigned by e.g. the administrators as just described to various user accounts either individually or in groups. In some embodiments the individual permissions may be grouped into user roles which may be assigned to users and or groups of users in accordance with their intended capacity. For example a data processing employee of the data provider may be granted permission to download a subset of the data provider s holdings and upload post processed data to replace the existing data but may not be allowed to view data holdings beyond those s he is permitted to manipulate nor is allowed to upload new data files. The user account information which includes biographical and or other relevant profile information authentication information such as passwords and or tokens associated rights and or permissions and association with various data and or data providers are in some embodiments stored in the user catalog. Such user account entries in the catalog may be utilized by e.g. the front end interface to provide a differing user experience depending on the authorized user such as only displaying portions of a UI pertinent to actions for which the user has rights and or permissions. It is contemplated that in some embodiments the concept of a user is unitary in that the only differentiation between e.g. public users and data provider employee users is the set subset or superset of rights and or permissions granted thereto.

When a specific represented extent is selected in some embodiments a metadata information card associated with the underlying data is displayed. In some embodiments the metadata information card contains detailed metadata e.g. geospatial or other metadata associated with the selected file. The metadata displayed may be context sensitive to the nature and content of the file to which it is associated. The metadata displayed may also be sensitive to the context in which it is displayed and may differ in appearance and or content based on the rights permissions of the authorized user the data provider s preference and or other considerations. The metadata displayed at one given time may be a subset of the available and or relevant metadata of the related context and in some embodiments a user may choose which of the different subsets of the available and or relevant metadata is displayed at any given time. Such viewing flexibility may be implemented in conjunction with the ability to view different levels of metadata within the metadata hierarchy described herein. For example the metadata information card may have multiple faces or displayed subsets of metadata for the relevant and or selected data file as well as one or more faces for any data set s to which the relevant and or selected data file belongs. In some embodiments if multiple files are simultaneously selected or the visually represented extents associated with such files is selected but such files do not belong to a data set metadata relevant to the amalgamated selection may be displayed and in some embodiments dynamically generated by the data management system .

The metadata information card or representation thereof may in some embodiments include functionality whereby its content is directly manipulable by third parties to the entity implementing the data management system. For example in embodiments where data providers do not provide or otherwise generate the metadata information card itself such data providers may provide various additional content to be displayed through the metadata information card in conjunction with the metadata representing their data. The additional content may be provided in any appropriate manner such as through an API UI integration with third party proprietary platforms and or applications or the like. Such additional content may include any content relevant to the data or data set s being represented such as visual previews of the data e.g. video files images three dimensional models various forms of data analytics such as information regarding the data s relationships to other data or other out of context but relevant information relating to the data and the like. The additional content may in some embodiments be integrated with existing views or faces as described above and or be displayed as additional views or faces within the metadata information card. The appearance and or omission of the additional content may be dynamically regulated by the inclusion or exclusion of the additional content by e.g. the data provider by the permissions and or rights of the user viewing the additional content and or the metadata information card the context in which the metadata information card is displayed and so on.

The metadata information card or a representation thereof may be portable in the sense that a representation of the card can be shared e.g. by email web link and or social media networks. In some embodiments the card may be shared via an API of the system or in some cases through an API of an external system. Such API based sharing may be entwined. For example an external social media network may import the card via an API of the data management system and itself may have an API through which data resident on its own platform is thereon generally shared. When the representation of the card is shared the underlying data itself is in a conceptual sense also shared the metadata displayed therewith provides users with sufficient information to understand the scope and content of the represented data. When displayed within the data management system s ecosystem the metadata information card in exemplary embodiments always shows live metadata information reflecting the state of the underlying data. When the metadata information card is shared for example by email to a recipient outside of the data management system described a static or dynamic representation of the card may be provided rather than a discrete file containing the card s information. Such a static or dynamic representation of the card may in some embodiments have some or all of the functionality of the associated card as displayed within the generated ecosystem e.g. the data management system or associated UI .

In embodiments where user authentication is required to access the stored data and or the data management system generally it may be contemplated that wide dissemination e.g. via social media networks may not be compatible. However in such embodiments the card may be configured such that when the recipient docks the card the link is set up such that it allows the recipient to access the data management system to view and or manipulate the specific data item associated with the card. In some of such embodiments any further actions associated with the specific data item and as may be contemplated other data items may require the recipient to obtain authorization to access the data management system e.g. by directing the recipient of the card to an account creation page of the front end interface .

In some embodiments the act of sharing the card may provide the data management system with additional information regarding the putative recipient of the card. In an exemplary embodiment a registered and authorized user of the data management system e.g. a public user may as part of the process by which s he shares the card specify certain information about the recipient such as the recipient s email address name company and the like. Optionally the authorized user may specify to prepay some or all of the costs associated with the recipient s use download and access to the data associated with the shared card. In such embodiments the system may for example encode the dock function in some cases an encoded URL to notify the system that the recipient has already had some of his her information specified on his behalf. In some embodiments the data management system may use information encoded in the dock function to notify the card s sender that the recipient has received and or docked the card. Upon docking and viewing the card on the front end interface of the data management system any further action requiring the recipient to create an account or otherwise authorize him herself with the data management system is facilitated by the information and or options entered by the registered and authorized during the process of sharing the card with the recipient. For example the account creation page may have the recipient s name and email address already entered and any payment owed for the download may show as reduced prepaid or negated.

The data management system and in some embodiments specifically components of the front end interface may track sharing and user creation activity similar to described immediately above. By doing so in some embodiments the system may develop a sociogram such as a social graph of user interactions over time. Similarly any information derived from the metadata i.e. metadata derived metadata may be used for tracking e.g. data provenance tracking analysis and or marketing purposes. In some embodiments such information may be used to facilitate and or target the marketing of services related to a given user. Other information such as geographic proximity of data providers or users respective data holdings and or purchases may also be used to deduce and or improve the relevance of services and or products marketed toward the user. Some metadata information such as DOI is associated with additional external tracking mechanisms and such external mechanisms may be integrated with the tracking mechanisms described herein.

The metadata engine or some other component within the data management system may infer metadata from other metadata or metadata derived metadata existing with the system. In some embodiments the data management system may provide a suggestion to e.g. a data provider as to an appropriate population of one or more metadata types. In an exemplary embodiment the system may suggest a price of a given data file or data set based on other metadata information stored within the system such as tracked sales history the prices of similar data and the like. Such suggestions may be conveyed through any appropriate facility of the system such as through the upload UI when displaying metadata in an edit mode of a UI or through the described metadata information card.

In some embodiments derivative information metrics related to the metadata information card or representation thereof itself may be derived and or generated by a relevant aspect of the data management system e.g. the front end interface or metadata engine and may be tracked stored and or displayed by the data management system. For example an aspect of the data management system may use DOI and or similar standards to compute statistics about the metadata information card and its associated source data or data sets. Examples of such statistics may include the number of views of the metadata information card the number of times the metadata information card is marked by users for tracking e.g. appearance on user watch lists the number locale etc. of downloads of or requests for the card and the like. Such tracked information may be displayed upon the card itself e.g. as a separate face or inline with other content on the card . Additionally the data management system may track store and or display derivative information metrics related to the data providers end users or other users of the data management system and or accounts created upon the data management system. Such information may be generated to for example determine the reliability accuracy level of activity or authority of a given data provider user or account on the data management system and the generated information may be displayed in any appropriate context including in conjunction with associated metadata information card s within interactions or transactions involving such users or accounts and the like. Such display of derivative information e.g. feedback may in some embodiments be intended to incentivize data providers users or accounts to increase or optimize their profile e.g. the quality of the data the participation rate of a user and the like . In some embodiments data providers users and or accounts may view derivative information related thereto in the aggregate e.g. information about the activity of a given metadata information card to view and or ascertain trends in the metrics as well as share some or all of the derivative information metrics with others. In some embodiments a notification may be provided e.g. to the requesting data provider user and or account or to others when any derivative information or metric crosses a user defined or predetermined threshold. For example a data provider may set a notification to be delivered to the public when a metadata information card derived from their data holdings exceeds a given number of views. Such a notification may for example further increase public visibility or interest in the data provider s data holdings.
