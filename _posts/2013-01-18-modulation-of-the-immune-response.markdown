This invention relates to methods and compositions for increasing the number and or activity of regulatory T cells Tregs in vivo and in vitro.

Regulatory T cells Treg control the autoreactive components of the immune system. Consequently Treg dysfunction is linked to severe autoimmunity and compounds that increase Treg numbers or activity are expected to be useful in the treatment of autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis.

Treg cells are a specialized subset of T cells involved in the control of pathogenic autoimmunity Sakaguchi et al. Ann. Rev Immunol. 22 531 562 2004. The importance of Treg for immunoregulation is highlighted by the immune disorders that result from Treg depletion with antibodies Sakaguchi et al. J. Immunol. 155 1151 64 1995 as a result of the thymectomy of 3 day old newborns Sakaguchi et al. J Exp Med. 156 1565 76 1982 or treatment with diphtheria toxin in transgenic mice with a Treg restricted expression of the diphtheria toxin receptor Kim et al. Nat Immunol. 8 191 7 2007 . In addition Treg deficiencies have been described in several autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis Viglietta et al. J. Exp. Med. 199 971 9 2004 rheumatoid arthritis Ehrenstein et al. J Exp Med. 200 277 85 2004 diabetes Brusko et al. Diabetes. 54 1407 14 2005 Lindley et al. Diabetes. 54 92 9 2005 and lupus Mudd et al. Scand. J. Immunol. 64 3 211 218 2006 .

The present invention is based at least in part on the discovery that transcription factors capable of modulating e.g. increasing or decreasing the expression and or activity of the Foxp3 gene provide useful targets for therapeutic immunomodulation. Accordingly the present invention provides inter alia compositions and methods for the prevention or treatment of diseases caused by an abnormal e.g. autoimmune or absent e.g. including insufficient immune response.

In one aspect the present invention features compositions including a ligand that bids specifically to an aryl hydrocarbon receptor AHR transcription factor lined to a biocompatible nanoparticle. The ligand can be e.g. a small molecule that competes for binding to the AHR competitively with 2 3 7 8 tetrachlorodibenzo p dioxin TCDD and activates AHR dependent signaling. In some embodiments the ligand is 2 3 7 8 tetrachlorodibenzo p dioxin TCDD tryptamine TA 2 1 H indole 3 carbonyl thiazole 4 carboxylic acid methyl ester ITE or 6 formylindolo 3 2 b carbazole FICZ .

In some embodiments the composition also includes an inhibitor of degradation of the ligand e.g. a monoamine oxidase inhibitor such as tranylcypromine. The inhibitor can be present on i.e. linked to the same nanoparticles linked to different nanoparticles of the same or different types or free in solution. In some embodiments the methods and compositions described herein include the use of a ligand that binds specifically to an aryl hydrocarbon receptor AHR transcription factor and an inhibitor of degradation thereof e.g. tryptamine and tranylcypromine wherein neither is linked to a nanoparticle.

In some embodiments the composition also includes an antibody that selectively binds to an antigen present on a T cell a B cell a dendritic cell or a macrophage. The antibody can be present on i.e. linked to the same nanoparticles linked to different nanoparticles of the same or different types or free in solution.

In a further aspect the invention features methods for increasing the number or activity of CD4 CD25 Foxp3 expressing T regulatory Treg cells in a population of T cells. The methods include contacting the population of cells with a sufficient amount of a composition comprising one or more AHR ligands selected from the group consisting of 2 3 7 8 tetrachlorodibenzo p dioxin TCDD tryptamine TA and 2 1 H indole 3 carbonyl thiazole 4 carboxylic acid methyl ester ITE wherein the ligand is linked to a biocompatible nanoparticle and optionally evaluating the presence and or number of CD4 CD25 Foxp3 expressing cells in the population. The method results in an increase in the number and or activity of regulatory T cells Treg .

In some embodiments the initial population of T cells includes one or both of na ve T cells or CD4 CD62 ligand T cells. The population of T cells can be isolated i.e. in vitro or in a living mammalian subject e.g. a subject who has an autoimmune disorder e.g. multiple sclerosis. In embodiments where the T cells are in a living subject the methods can include administering the one or more ligands orally mucosally or intravenously.

In some embodiments Treg cells generated or activated using a method described herein are administered to a subject suffering from an autoimmune disorder in an amount sufficient to improve or ameliorate a symptom of the disorder.

A test compound that increases or decreases expression of the reporter gene is a candidate compound that modulates generation of Treg.

The methods can optionally include measuring expression of the reporter construct in the presence of a known AHR ligand selected from the group consisting of TCDD tryptamine and ITE or a compound that binds to the AHR competitively therewith determining whether the candidate compound competes for binding to the AHR with the known compound and selecting the candidate compound if it binds the AHR competitively with the known compound.

In one aspect the present invention provides methods of identifying candidate compounds that modulate the generation of regulator T cells Treg . These methods include providing a cell expressing a reporter construct containing a binding sequence for a transcription factor operably linked to a reporter gene. Suitable binding sequences for inclusion in the reporter construct include NKX22 AHR EGR1 EGR2 EGR3 NGFIC and Delta EFI. The cell is then contacted with a test compound and the effect of the test compound on expression of the reporter gene is evaluated. A test compound that increases or decreases expression of the reporter gene is a candidate compound that modulates generation of Treg.

In another aspect the present invention provides methods of identifying candidate compounds that modulate generation of regulator T cells Treg . These methods include providing a living zebrafish e.g. a zebrafish embryo e.g. 30 minutes after the egg is laid contacting the zebrafish with a test compound e.g. by putting the test compound in water in which the zebrafish is living or microinjecting the compound into an embryo and evaluating an effect of the test compound on Foxp3 expression in the zebrafish wherein a test compound that increases or decreases expression of Fox 3 in the zebrafish is a candidate compound that modulates generation of Treg.

In a further aspect the present invention provides compositions comprising transcription factor ligands capable of promoting increased expression activity or both of a Foxp3 gene.

In yet another aspect the present invention provides methods for increasing the numbers of Treg in a population of T cells. These methods include contacting the cell with one or more transcription factor ligands e.g. selected from the group consisting of 2 3 7 8 tetrachlorodibenzo p dioxin TCDD tryptamine TA and 2 1 H indole 3 carbonyl thiazole 4 carboxylic acid methyl ester ITE wherein the method results in an increase in the number and or activity of regulatory T cells Treg . In some embodiments the methods include determining levels of Foxp3 expression in the cells.

Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description and figures and from the claims.

Because of the importance of the central role Tregs play in immunomodulation characterization of the pathways and identification of compounds capable of modulating these pathways e.g. to promote the generation e.g. differentiation of cells to or toward Treg cells or that promote increased activity of Tregs is important for the treatment of e.g. autoimmunity infections and cancer.

The present invention provides inter alia compositions and methods useful for therapeutic immunomodulation.

Accordingly the present invention is based at least in part on the discovery that modulation of the AhR by compounds described herein can be used to modulate e.g. increase or decrease the number and or activity of immunomodulatory cells in vitro and in vivo.

In some embodiments the present invention is based on the identification of the ligand activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor AHR as a Foxp3 dependent regulator of Treg differentiation e.g. generation and or activity in vitro and in vivo. Also described herein are ligands of a transcription factor e.g. AHR that cause increased Treg expression and or activity. More specifically the data presented herein demonstrates the use of AHR specific ligands e.g. the high affinity AHR ligand 2 3 7 8 tetrachlorodibenzo p dioxin TCDD tryptamine TA and or 2 1 H indole 3 carbonyl thiazole 4 carboxylic acid methyl ester ITE to promote an increase in the number and or activity of Treg immunomodulatory cells which will be useful to suppress the immune response in the treatment of diseases or disorders caused by an abnormal e.g. an excessive elevated or inappropriate immune response e.g. an autoimmune disease or disorder. Surprisingly effective doses of TCDD can be administered intravenously or orally.

Other potentially useful AHR transcription factor ligands are described in Denison and Nagy Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 43 309 34 2003 and references cited herein all of which are incorporated herein in their entirety. Other such molecules include planar hydrophobic HAHs such as the polyhalogenated dibenzopdioxins dibenzofurans and biphenyls and PAHs such as 3 methylcholanthrene benzo a pyrene benzanthracenes and benzoflavones and related compounds. Denison and Nagy 2003 supra . Nagy et al. Toxicol. Sci. 65 200 10 2002 described a high throughput screen useful for identifying and confirming other ligands. See also Nagy et al. Biochem. 41 861 68 2022 . In some embodiments those ligands useful in the present invention are those that bind competitively with TCDD TA and or ITE.

In some embodiments the present invention provides methods useful for identifying transcription factors e.g. ligand activated transcription factors and or ligands e.g. ligands capable of promoting an increased association between a ligand activated transcription factor and Foxp3 capable of modulating e.g. increasing or decreasing Foxp3 expression or activity.

As sated above the present invention includes the identification of specific transcription factor binding sites in the Foxp3 gene. These binding sites include i.e. NKX22 AHR EGR1 EGR2 EGR3 NGFIC and Delta EF1. As described herein manipulating activity and or levels of those TFs can alter expression of Foxp3 and thus modulate e.g. promote generation and or increased activity of Treg in vivo and in vitro. Compounds that modulate the activity and or levels of those TFs to increase generation and or activity of Treg are useful e.g. in the treatment of disorders in which it is desirable to decrease an aberrant immune response e.g. autoimmune diseases.

Sequences useful in the methods described herein include but are not limited to e.g. NKX22 AHR EGR1 EGR2 EGR3 NGFIC and Delta EF1 sequences and TF binding sequences therefore all of which are known in the rt. In some embodiments the methods include the use of nucleic acids or polypeptides that are at least 80 identical to a human NKX22 AHR EGR1 EGR2 EGR3 NGFIC or Delta EF1 sequence e.g. at least 80 85 90 or 95 identical to a human sequence as described herein.

To determine the percent identity of two sequences the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes e.g. gaps can be introduce din one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes . The length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 60 . e.g. at least 70 80 90 100 of the length of the reference sequence. The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences taking into account the number of gaps and the length of each gap which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences.

The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. In the present methods the percent identity between two amino acid sequences is determined using the Needleman and Wunsch 1970 J. Mol. Biol. 48 444 453 algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package available on the world wide web at gcg.com using a Blossum 62 scoring matrix with a gap penalty of 12 a gap extend penalty of 4 and a frameshift gap penalty of 5.

Active fragments of TFs useful in the methods described herein are those fragments that bind to the same DNA sequence e.g. promoter sequence that the full length TF binds to and has at least 30 of the transcription initiating activity of the full length TF e.g. at least 40 50 60 70 80 90 or more of the activity of the full length protein on the same promoters and the same genes as the full length protein.

At least in some species Treg differentiation and function is driven by the transcription factor Foxp3 Fontenot et al. Nat. Immunol. 4 330 336 2003 Hori et al. Science 299 1057 61 2003 . Foxp3 may also be important for human Treg mutations in Foxp3 have been linked to various immunological conditions e.g. autoimmune conditions for example autoimmune syndrome immune dysregulation polyendocrinopathy and enteropathy X linked IPEX Chatila et al. J. Clin. Invest. 106 R75 81 2000 Gavin et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 103 6659 64 2006 . In humans Foxp3 negative Tregs have also been described see e.g. Roncarolo and Gregori Eur J Immunol. 38 925 2008 .

Exemplary human Foxp3 mRNA sequences are known in the art and include Genbank Acc. No. NM014009.2 the amino acid sequence of the protein is Genbank Acc. No. NP054728.2. The sequence of the human Foxp3 gene can be found at NC000023.9 the mouse gene is at NT039700.6. The Foxp3 promoter has been identified and sequenced see e.g. Mantel et al. J. Immunol. 176 6 3593 2006 . All of the binding sites for AHR in the mouse Foxp3 gene are highlighted e.g. in the binding sites for the other TFs are identified in .

As described herein NKX22 AHR and Delta EF1 increase transcription of Foxp3. Therefore compounds that increase levels and or activity of these TFs would increase the generation and or activity of Treg. Conversely compounds that decrease levels and or activity of these TFs would be expected to decrease generation of Tregs thereby increasing the immune response.

Exemplary human AhR mRNA sequences are known in the art and include Genbank Acc. No. NM001621.3 the amino acid sequence of the protein is Genbank Acc. No. NP0014612.1.

Consensus recognition sequences that bind AhR include the sequence TNGCGTG.

Exemplary human Delta EF1 mRNA sequences are known in the art and include Genbank Acc. No. NM030751.3 the amino acid sequence of the protein is Genbank Acc. No. NP110378.2.

Exemplary human NKX2.2 mRNA sequences are known in the art and include Genbank Acc. No. NM00250902 the amino acid sequence of the protein is Genbank Acc.

As described herein EGR1 EGR2 EGR3 and NGFIC EGR4 decrease transcription of Foxp3. Therefore compounds that increase levels and or activity of these TFs would decrease generation of Treg thereby increasing the immune response. Conversely compounds that decrease levels and or activity of these TFs would be expected to increase generation of Tregs reducing the immune response.

Methods of Identifying Compounds that Modulate Expression Levels or Activity of One or More of NKX22 AHR EGR1 EGR2 EGR3 NGFIC and Delta EF1

A number of methods are known in the art for evaluating whether a compound alters expression levels or activity of one or more of NKX22 AHR EGR1 EGR2 EGR3 NGFIC and or Delta EF1.

Methods of assessing expression are well known in the art and include but are not limited to Northern analysis ribonuclease protection assay reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT PCR real time PCR and RNA in situ hybridization see e.g. Sambrook et al. 3Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 200 . Levels of peptides can be monitored by e.g. Western analysis immunoassay or in situ hybridization. Activity e.g. altered promoter binding and or transcription activity can be determined by e.g. electrophoretic mobility shift assay DNA footprinting reporter gene assay or a serine threonine or tyrosine phosphorylation assay. In some embodiments the effect of a test compound on expression level or activity is observed as a change in glucose tolerance or insulin secretion of the cell cell extract co culture explant or subject. In some embodiments the effect of a test compound on expression level or activity of one or more of NKX22 AHR EGR1 EGR2 EGR3 NGFIC and or Delta EF1 is evaluated in transgenic cell or non human animal or explant tissue or cell derived therefrom having altered glucose tolerance or insulin secretion and can be compared to a control e.g. wild type animal or explant or cell derived therefrom.

The effect of a test compound on expression level or activity can be evaluated in a cell e.g. a cultured mammalian cell a pancreatic beta cell cell lysate or subject e.g. a non human experimental mammal such as a rodent e.g. a rat mouse or rabbit or a cell tissue or organ explant e.g. pancreas or pancreatic cells.

In some embodiments the ability of a test compound to modulate level expression or activity of one or more of NKX22 AHR EGR1 EGR2 EGR3 NGFIC and or Delta EF1 is evaluated in a knockout animal or other animal having decreased expression level or activity of one or more of NKX22 AHR EGR1 EGR2 EGR3 NGFIC and or Delta EF1 conditional knockout transgenic animal.

In some embodiments the ability of a test compound to modulate e.g. increase or decrease e.g. permanently or temporarily expression from one or more of NKX22 AHR EGR1 EGR2 EGR3 NGFIC and or Delta EF1 promoter can be evaluated by e.g. a routine reporter e.g. LacZ or GFP transcription assay. For example a cell or transgenic animal whose genome includes a reporter gene operably linked to an NKX22 AHR EGR1 EGR2 EGR3 NGFIC and or Delta EF1 promoter can be contacted with a test compound the ability of the test compound to increase or decrease the activity of the reporter gene or gene product is indicative of the ability of the compound to modulate expression of the TF. In another example a cell or transgenic animal whose genome includes a reporter gene operably linked to a promoter comprising a recognition sequence for one of those TFs e.g. all or a portion of the Foxp3 promoter comprising recognition sequences for one of those TFs can be contacted with a test compound the ability of the test compound to increase or decrease the activity of the reporter gene or gene product is indicative of the ability of the compound to modulate activity of the TF.

The test compound can be administered to a cell cell extract explant or subject e.g. an experimental animal expressing a transgene comprising an NKX22 AHR EGR1 EGR2 EGR3 NGFIC and or Delta EF1 promoter or recognition sequence fused to a reporter such as GFP or LacZ see e.g. Nehls et al. Science 272 886 889 1996 and Lee et al. Dev. Biol. 208 362 374 1999 describing placing the beta galactosidase reporter gene under control of the whn promoter . Enhancement or inhibition of transcription of a transgene e.g. a reporter such as LacZ or GFP as a result of an effect of the test compound on the promoter or factors regulating transcription from the promoter can be used to assay an effect of the test compound on transcription of one or more of the TFs identified herein. Reporter transcript levels and this promoter activity can also be monitored by other known methods e.g. Northern analysis ribonuclease protection assay reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT PCR or RNA in situ hybridization see e.g. Cuncliffe et al. Mamm. Genome 13 245 252 2002 Sambrook et al. 3Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 2001 . Test compounds can also be evaluated using a cell free system e.g. an environment including a promoter reporter transgene e.g. an ARNT promoter LacZ transgene transcription factors binding the promoter a crude cell lysate or nuclear extract and one or more test compounds e.g. a test compound as described herein wherein an effect of the compound on promoter activity is detected as a color change.

In one embodiment the screening methods described herein include the use of a chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP assay in which cells e.g. pancreatic beta cells expressing one or more of the TFs identified herein are exposed to a test compound. The cells are optionally subjected to crosslinking e.g. using UV or formaldehyde to form DNA protein complexes and the DNA is fragmented. The DNA protein complexes are immunoprecipitated e.g. using an antibody directed to one or more of the TFs identified herein. The protein is removed e.g. by enzymatic digestion and analyzed e.g. using a microarray. In this way changes in binding of the transcription factor to its target genes can be evaluated thus providing a measure of activity of the TFs identified herein.

Test compounds for use in the methods described herein are not limited and can include crude or partially or substantially purified extracts of organic sources e.g. botanical e.g. herbal and algal extracts inorganic elements or compounds as well as partially or substantially purified or synthetic compounds e.g. small molecules polypeptides antibodies and polynucleotides and libraries thereof.

A test compound that has been screened by a method described herein and determined to increase expression levels or activity of one or more of the TFs described herein can be considered a candidate compound for the treatment of a disorder treatable with immune therapy i.e. by increasing or decreasing control of the immune response by increasing or decreasing levels of Treg e.g. cancer or an autoimmune disorder. A candidate compound that has been screened e.g. in an in vivo model of a disorder treatable with immune therapy e.g. cancer or an autoimmune disorder and determined to have a desirable effect on the disorder e.g. on one or more symptoms of the disorder can be considered a candidate therapeutic agent. Candidate therapeutic agents once screened and verified in a clinical setting are therapeutic agents. Candidate therapeutic agents and therapeutic agents can be optionally optimized and or derivatized and formulated with physiologically acceptable excipients to form pharmaceutical compositions.

As described above the present invention is based at least in part on the identification of useful targets for therapeutic immunomodulation. Accordingly the present invention provides compositions and methods for treating a patient e.g. a human with an immunological condition. Immunological conditions that will benefit from treatment using the present invention include those diseases or disorders caused by an autoimmune response or an absent or insufficient immune response.

Autoimmunity is presently the most common cause of disease in the world and is the third most prevent disease in the U.S. Autoimmune conditions that may benefit from treatment using the compositions and methods described herein include but are not limited to for example Addison s Disease alopecia ankylosing spondylitis autiphospholipid syndrome autoimmune hemolytic anemia autoimmune hepatitis autoimmune oophoritis Bechet s disease bullous permphigoid celica disease chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome CFIDS chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy Churg Strauss syndrome cicatricial pemphigoid cold agglutinin disease CREST Syndrome Crohn s disease diabetes e.g. type I dysautonomia endometriosis eosinophilia myalgia syndrome essential mixed cryoglobulinemia fibromyalgia syndrome fibromyositis Graves disease Guilla n Barr syndrome Hashimoto s thyroiditis idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura ITP inflammatory bowel disease IBD lichen planus lupus M ni re s disease mixed connective tissue disease MCTD multiple sclerosis myasthenia gravis pemphigus pernicious anemia polyarteritis nodosa polychondritis polymyalgia rheumatica polymyositits and dermatomyositis primary agammaglobulinemia primary biliary cirrhosis psoriasis Raynaud s phenomenon Reiter s syndrome rheumatic fever rheumatoid arthritis sarcoidosis scleroderma Sj gren s syndrome spondyloarthropathy stiff man syndrome Takayasu arteritis temporal arteritis giant cell arteritis thyroid disease ulcerative colitis uveitis vaculitis vitiligo and Wegener s granulomatosis.

As described herein a patient with one or more autoimmune conditions can be treated by increasing the number of Treg cells and or the activity of Treg cells in the patient using e.g. a therapeutically effective amount of one or more transcription factors e.g. a ligand activated transcription factor such as AHR and or one or more transcription factor ligands e.g. TCDD tryptamine TA and or 2 1 H indole 3 carbonyl thiazole 4 carboxylic acid methyl ester ITE that are capable of promoting an increase in the expression and or activity of Foxp3 and thereby promoting an increase in the number or activity of Treg cells in vitro and or in vivo.

In some embodiments the methods include administering e.g. to a population of T cells or to a subject a composition comprising a nucleic acid encoding a transcription factory as described herein e.g. e.g. NKX22 AHR EGR1 EGR2 EGR3 NGFIC and or Delta EF1. The nucleic acid can be in an expression vector e.g. a modified viral vector such as is known in the art e.g. a lentivirus retrovirus or adenovirus. Methods for using these vectors in cell or gene therapy protocols are known in the art. For cell therapy methods it is desirable to start with a population of T cells taken from the subject to be treated.

In some embodiments the methods include administering a composition comprising a ligand that activates a transcription factor described herein e.g. the AHR receptor. In some embodiments the ligand is co administered with one or more inhibitors of its degradation e.g. tryptamine together with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor e.g. tranylcypromine. The inhibitor can be administered in the same or in a separate composition. Thus the invention also includes compositions comprising tryptamine and an inhibitor of its degradation e.g. a MAOI e.g. tranylcypromine.

In some embodiments a patient in need of treatment can be administered a pharmaceutically effective dose of one or more ligands capable of promoting an increase in the expression and or activity of Foxp3 and thereby promoting an increase in the number or activity of Treg cells in Vitro and or in vivo e.g. TCDD tryptamine TA and or 2 1 H indole 3 carbonyl thiazole 4 carboxylic acid methyl ester ITE .

Alternatively or in addition a population of cells capable of differentiation into Treg cells e.g. na ve T cells and or CD4 CD62 ligand T cells can be contacted with a transcription factor ligand capable of promoting increase in Foxp3 expression and or activity e.g. TCDD tryptamine TA and or 2 1 H indole 3 carbonyl thiazole 4 carboxylic acid methyl ester ITE in vitro thereby effectively promoting an increase in the number of Treg cells in the population. Alternatively or in addition a population of cells containing Treg cells e.g. isolated Treg cells e.g. 100 or a population of cells containing at least 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 or 99 Treg cells can be contacted with a transcription factor ligand capable of promoting an increase in Foxp3 expression and or activity e.g. TCDD tryptamine TA and or or 2 indole 3 carbonyl thiazole 4 carboxylic acid methyl ester ITE thereby effectively promoting an increase in the activity of the Treg cells in the population. Alternatively or in addition the cells can be contacted with an expression vector e.g. a viral vector such as a lentivirus retrovirus or adenovirus comprising a nucleic acid encoding a transcription factor described herein e.g. NKX22 AHR EGR1 EGR2 EGR3 NGFIC and Delta EF1. In some embodiments the cells are also activated e.g. by contacting them with an effective amount of a T cell activating agent e.g. a composition of one or both of anti CD3 antibodies and anti CD28 antibodies. One or more cells from these populations can then be administered to the patient alone or in combination with one or more ligands capable of promoting an increase in the expression and or activity of Foxp3 and thereby promoting an increase in the number or activity of Treg cells in vitro and or in vivo e.g. TCDD tryptamine TA and or 2 1 H indole 3 carbonyl thiazole 4 carboxylic acid methyl ester ITE .

The compositions and methods described herein are of particular use for treating a patient e.g. a human that would benefit from therapeutic immunomodulation e.g. a patient in need of a suppressed immune response . The methods include selecting a patient in need of treatment and administering to the patient one or more of the compositions described herein. A subject in need of treatment can be identified e.g. by their medical practitioner.

In some embodiments the methods include determining presence and or levels of autoantibodies to an autoantigen specific for the disease e.g. the presence and or levels of autoantibodies to an autoantigen listed in Table 1 or 2. The results can be used to determine a subject s likelihood or risk of developing the disease subjects can be selected for treatment using a method described herein based on the presence and or levels of autoantibodies.

During and or following treatment a patient can be assessed at one or more time points for example using methods known in the art for assessing severity of the specific autoimmune disease or its symptoms to determine the effectiveness of the treatment. In some embodiments levels of autoantibodies to an autoantigen specific for the disease can also be monitored e.g. levels of autoantibodies to an autoantigen listed in Table 1 or 2 a decrease e.g. a significant decrease in levels of autoantibodies would indicate a positive response i.e. indicating that the treatment is successful see e.g. Quintana et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 101 suppl. 2 1465 14621 2004 . Treatment can then be continued without modification modified to improve the progress or outcome e.g. increase dosage levels frequency of administration the amount of the pharmaceutical composition and or change the mode of administration or stopped.

A therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the compositions described herein can be administered by standard methods for example by one or more routes of administration e.g. by one or more of the routes of administration currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA see for example world wide web address fda.gov cder dsm DRG drg00301.htm e.g. orally topically mucosally intravenously or intramuscularly.

In some embodiments one or more of the ligands described herein can be administered orally with surprising effectiveness.

A therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the compositions e.g. including but not limited to one or more of the small molecule ligands for example TCDD tryptamine TA and or 2 1 H indole 3 carbonyl thiazole 4 carboxylic acid methyl ester ITE described herein can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration to a subject e.g. a human. Such compositions typically include the composition and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the language pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is intended to include any and all solvents dispersion media coating antibacterial and antifungal agents isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like compatible with pharmaceutical administration. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances are know. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound such media can be used in the compositions of the invention. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions e.g. an inhibitor of degradation of the ligand.

In some embodiments the composition can also include an autoantigen e.g. an autoantigen listed in Table 1 or 2 or another autoantigen known in the art to be associated with an autoimmune disease.

A pharmaceutical composition can be formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral intradermal or subcutaneous application can include the following components a sterile diluent such as water for injection saline solution fixed oils polyethylene glycols glycerine propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid buffers such as acetates citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.

Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions where water soluble or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration suitable carriers include physiological saline bacteriostatic water Cremophor EL BSAF Parsippany N.J. or phosphate buffered saline PBS . In all cases the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing for example water ethanol polyol for example glycerol propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol and the like and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained for example by the use of a coating such as lecithin by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms to be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents for example parabens chlorobutanol phenol ascorbic acid thimerosal and the like. In many cases it will be preferable to include isotonic agents for example sugars polyalcohols such as mannitol sorbitol sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption for example aluminum monostearate and gelatin.

Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the composition e.g. an agent described herein in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above as required followed by filtered sterilization. Generally dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile filtered solution thereof.

Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets troches or capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is applied orally and swished and expectorated or swallowed. Pharmaceutically compatible biding agents and or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets pills capsules troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients or compounds of a similar nature a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose gun tragacanth or gelatin an excipient such as starch or lactose a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid PRIMOGEL sodium carboxymethyl starch or corn starch a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or STEROTES a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin or a flavoring agent such as peppermint methyl salicylate or orange flavoring.

Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known and include for example for transmucosal administration detergents bile salts and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration the active compounds are formulated into ointments salves gels or creams as generally known in the art.

In one embodiment the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body such as a controlled release formulation including implants and microencapsulated delivery system. Biodegradable biocompatible polymers can be used such as ethylene vinyl acetate polyanhydrides polyglycolic acid collage polyorthoesters and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals Inc. Liposomal suspensions including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 522 811.

Nucleic acid molecules can be inserted into vectors and used as gene therapy vectors. Gene therapy vectors can be delivered to a subject by for example intravenous injection local administration see U.S. Pat. No. 5 328 470 or by sterotactic injection see e.g. Chen et al. PNAS 91 3054 3057 1994 . The pharmaceutical preparation of the gene therapy vector can include the gene therapy vector in an acceptable diluent or can include a slow release matrix in which the gene delivery vehicle is imbedded. Alternatively where the complete gene delivery vector can be produced intact from recombinant cells e.g. retroviral vectors the pharmaceutical preparation can include one or more cells which produce the gene delivery system.

The pharmaceutical compositions can be include in a container pack or dispenser together with instructions for administration. In one aspect the pharmaceutical compositions can be included as a part of a kit.

Generally the dosage used to administer a pharmaceutical compositions facilitates an intended purpose for prophylaxis and or treatment without undesirable side effects such as toxicity irritation or allergic response. Although individual needs may vary the determination of optimal ranges for effective amounts of formulations is within the skill of the art. Human doses can readily be extrapolated from animal studies Katocs et al. Chapter 27 In Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 18th Ed. Gennaro ed. Mack Publishing Co. Easton Pa. 1990 . Generally the dosage required to provide an effective amount of a formulation which can be adjusted by one skilled in the art will vary depending on several factors including the age health physical condition weight type and extent of the disease or disorder of the recipient frequency of treatment the nature of concurrent therapy if require and the nature and scope of the desired effect s Nies et al. Chapter 3 In Goodman Gilman s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics 9th Ed. Hardman et al. eds. McGraw Hill New York N.Y. 1996 .

As demonstrated herein compositions comprising nanoparticles linked to AHR ligands are surprisingly effective in delivering the ligand both orally and by injection and in inducing the Treg response in living animals. Thus the invention further includes compositions comprising AHR ligands linked to biocompatible nanoparticles optionally with antibodies that target the nanoparticles to selected cells or tissues.

AHR specific ligands e.g. the high affinity AHR ligand 2 3 7 8 tetrachloro dibenzo p dioxin TCDD tryptamine TA and or 2 1 H indole 3 carbonyl thiazole 4 carboxylic acid methyl ester ITE promote an increase in the number and or activity of Treg immunomodulatory cells which will be useful to suppress the immune response in the treatment of diseases or disorders cause by an abnormal e.g. an excessive elevated or inappropriate immune response e.g. an autoimmune disease or disorder.

Other potentially useful AHR transcription factor ligands are described in Denison and Nagy Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 43 309 34 2003 and references cited herein all of which are incorporated herein in their entirety. Other such molecules include planar hydrophobic HAHs such as the polyhalogenated dibenzopdioxins dibenzofurans and biphenyls and PAHs such as 3 methylcholanthrene benzo a pyrene benzanthracenes and bensoflavones and related compounds. Denison and Nagy 2003 supra . Nagy et al. Toxicol Sci. 65 200 10 2002 described a high throughput screen useful for identifying and confirming other ligands. See also Nagy et al. Biochem. 41 861 68 2002 . In some embodiments those ligands useful in the nanoparticle compositions are those that bind competitively with TCDD TA and or ITE.

The nanoparticles useful in the methods and compositions described herein are made of materials that are i biocompatible i.e. do not cause a significant adverse reaction in a living animal when use din pharmaceutically relevant amounts ii feature functional groups to which the binding moiety can be covalently attached iii exhibit low non specific binding of interactive moieties to the nanoparticle and iv are stable in solution i.e. the nanoparticles do not precipitate. The nanoparticles can be monodisperse a single crystal of a material e.g. a metal per nanoparticle or polydisperse a plurality of crystals e.g. 2 3 or 4 per nanoparticle .

A number of biocompatible nanoparticles are known in the art e.g. organic or inorganic nanoparticles. Liposomes dendrimers carbon nanomaterials and polymeric micelles are examples of organic nanoparticles. Quantum dots can also be used. Inorganic nanoparticles include metallic nanoparticle e.g. Au Ni Pt and TiO2 nanoparticles. Magnetic nanoparticles can also be used e.g. spherical nanocrystals of 10 20 nm with a Fe2 and or FE3 core surrounded by dextran or PEG molecules. in some embodiments colloidal gold nanoparticles are used e.g. as described in Qian et al. Nat. Biotechnol. 26 1 83 90 2008 U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 060 121 7 232 474 and U.S. P.G. Pub. No. 2008 0166706. Suitable nanoparticles and methods for constructing and using multifunctional nanoparticles are discussed in e.g. Sanvicens and Marco Trends Biotech. 26 8 425 433 2008 .

In all embodiments the nanoparticles are attached linked to the AHR ligands described herein via a functional groups. In some embodiments the nanoparticles are associated with a polymer that includes the functional groups and also serves to keep the metal oxides dispersed from each other. The polymer can be a synthetic polymer such as but not limited to polyethylene glycol or silane natural polymers or derivatives of either synthetic or natural polymers or a combination of these. Useful polymers are hydrophilic. In some embodiments the polymer coating is not a continuous film around the magnetic metal oxide but is a mesh or cloud of extended polymer chains attached to and surrounding the metal oxide. The polymer can comprise polysaccharides and derivatives including dextran pullanan carboxydextran carboxymethyl dextran and or reduced carboxymethyl dextran. The metal oxide can be a collection of one or more crystals that contact each other or that tare individually entrapped or surrounded by the polymer.

In other embodiments the nanoparticles are associated with non polymeric functional group compositions. Methods are known to synthesize stabilized functionalized nanoparticles without associated polymers which are also within the scope of this invention. Such methods are described for example in Halbreich et al. Biochimie 80 5 6 379 90 1998.

In some embodiments the nanoparticles have an overall size of less than about 1 100 nm e.g. about 25 75 nm e.g. about 40 60 nm or about 50 60 nm in diameter. The polymer component in some embodiments can be in the form of a coating e.g. about 5 to 20 nm thick or more. The overall size of the nanoparticles is about 15 to 200 nm e.g. about 20 to 100 nm about 40 to 60 nm or about 60 nm.

There are varieties of ways that the nanoparticles can be prepared but in all methods the result must be a nanoparticle with functional groups that can be used to link the nanoparticle to be binding moiety.

For example AHR ligands can be linked to the metal oxide through covalent attachment to a functionalized polymer or to non polymeric surface functionalized metal oxides. In the latter method the nanoparticles can be synthesized according to a version of the method of Albrecht et al. Biochimie 80 5 6 379 90 1998. Dimercapto succinic acid is coupled to the nanoparticle and provides a carboxyl functional group. By functionalized is meant the presence of amino or carboxyl or other reactive groups that can be used to attach desired moieties to the nanoparticles e.g. the AHR ligands described herein or antibodies.

In another embodiment the AHR ligands are attached to the nanoparticles via a functionalized polymer associated with the nanoparticle. In some embodiments the polymer is hydrophilic. In a specific embodiment the conjugates are made using oligonucleotides that have terminal amino sulfhydryl or phosphate groups and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles bearing amino or carboxy groups on a hydrophilic polymer. There are several methods for synthesizing carboxy and amino derivatized nanoparticles. Methods for synthesizing functionalized coated nanoparticles are discussed in further detail below.

Carboxy functionalized nanoparticles can be made for example according to the method of Gorman see WO 00 61191 . Carboxy functionalized nanoparticles can also be made from polysaccharide coated nanoparticles by reaction with bromo or chloroacetic acid in strong base to attach carboxyl groups. In addition carboxy functionalized particles can be made from amino functionalized nanoparticles by converting amino to carboxy groups by the use of reagents such as succinic anhydride or maleic anhydride.

Nanoparticle size can be controlled by adjusting reaction conditions for example by varying temperature as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 262 176. Uniform particle size materials can also be made by fractionating the particles using centrifugation ultrafiltration or gel filtration as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 492 814.

Nanoparticles can also be treated with periodate to form aldehyde groups. The aldehyde containing nanoparticles can then be reacted with diamine e.g. ethylene diamine or hexanediamine which will form a Schiff base followed by reduction with sodium borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride.

Dextran coated nanoparticles can also be made and cross linked e.g. with epichlorohydrin. The addition of ammonia will react with epoxy groups to generate amine groups see Hogemann et al. Bioconjug. Chem. 2000. 11 6 941 6 and Josephson et al. Bioconjug. Chem. 1999 10 2 186 91.

Carboxy functionalized nanoparticles can be converted to amino functionalized magnetic particles by the use of water soluble carbodiimides and diamines such as ethylene diamine or hexane diamine.

Avidin or streptavidin can be attached to nanoparticles for use with a biotinylated binding moiety such as an oligonucleotide or polypeptide. See e.g. Shen et al. Bioconjug. Chem. 1996 7 3 311 6. Similarly biotin can be attached to a nanoparticle for use with an avidin labeled binding moiety.

In all of these methods low molecular weight compounds can be separated from the nanoparticles by ultra filtration dialysis magnetic separation or other means. The unreacted AHR ligands can be separated from the ligand nanoparticle conjugates e.g. by size exclusion chromatography.

In some embodiments colloidal gold nanoparticles are made using methods known in the art e.g. as described in Qian et al. Nat. Biotechnol. 26 1 83 90 2008 U.S. Pat Nos. 7 060 597 7 232 474 and U.S. P.G. Pub. 2008 0166706.

In some embodiments the nanoparticles are pegylated e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 291 684 5 145 684 6 270 806 7 348 030 and others.

In some embodiments the nanoparticles also include antibodies to selectively target a cell. The term antibody as used herein refers to full length tow chain immunoglobulin molecules and antigen binding portions and fragments thereof including synthetic variants. A typical full length antibody includes two heavy H chain variable regions abbreviated herein as VH and two light L chain variable regions abbreviated herein as VL . The term antigen binding fragment of an antibody as used herein refers to one or more fragments of a full length antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to a target. Examples of antigen binding fragments include but are not limited to i a Fab fragment a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL VH CL and CH1 domains ii a F ab fragment a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region iii a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains iv a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody v a dAb fragment Ward et al. Nature 341 544 546 1989 which consists of a VH domain and vi an isolated complementarity determining region CDR . Furthermore although the two domains of the Fv fragment VL and VH are coded for by separate genes they can be joined using recombinant methods by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules known as single chain Fv scFv see e.g. Bird et al. Science 242 423 426 1998 and Huston et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 5879 5883 1988 . Such single chain antibodies are also encompassed within the term antigen binding fragment. 

Production of antibodies and antibody fragments is well documented in the field. See e.g. Harlow and Lane 1998. . Cold Spring Harbor New York Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. For example Jones et al. Nature 321 522 525 1986 which discloses replacing the CDRs of a human antibody with those from a mouse antibody. Marx Science 229 455 456 1985 discusses chimeric antibodies having mouse variable regions and human constant regions. Rodwell Nature 342 99 100 1989 discusses lower molecular weight recognition elements derived from antibody CDR information. Clackson Br. J. Rheumatol. 3052 36 39 1991 discusses genetically engineered monoclonal antibodies including Fv fragment derivatives single chain antibodies fusion proteins chimeric antibodies and humanized rodent antibodies. Reichman et al. Nature 332 323 327 1988 discloses a human antibody on which rat hypervariable regions have been grafted. Verhoeyen et al. Science 239 1534 1536 1988 teaches grafting of a mouse antigen binding site onto a human antibody.

In the methods described herein it would be desirable to target the compounds to T cells B cells dendritic cells and or macrophages therefore antibodies selective for one or more of those cell types can be used. For example for T cells anti CXCR4 anti CD28 anti CD8 anti TTLA4 or anti CD3 antibodies can be used for B cells antibodies to CD20 CD19 or to B cell receptors can be used for dendritic cell targeting exemplary antibodies to CD11c DEC205 MHC class I or class II CD80 or CD86 can be used for macrophages exemplary antibodies to CD11b MHC class I or class II CD80 or CD86 can be used. Other suitable antibodies are known in the art.

The invention is further described in the following examples which do not limit the scope of the invention described in the claims.

The zebrafish is an experimental model of vertebrate development as described herein it can also be used as an immunogenic model. This example describes the cloning and characterize of the zebrafish functional homologue of mammalian Foxp3 herein termed zFoxp3 .

To investigate whether Foxp3 dependent immunoregulatory mechanisms operate in the zebrafish we searched the zebrafish genome for a Foxp3 homologue which we termed zFoxp3 . A phylogenetic analysis placed zFoxp3 in a sub tree together with mammalian and other fish orthologous predictions suggesting that zFoxp3 is the zebrafish ortholog for mammalian Foxp3 . In mammals Foxp3 is located in a well conserved synteny block. Indeed we found several orthologous genes between mammalian chromosome X and zebrafish chromosome 8 in the region where zFoxp3 is located suv39h1 cacna1s tspy12 wasp strengthening the likelihood of zFoxp3 being the fish ortholog of Foxp3.

The accession numbers for the amino acid sequences use din the gene tree analysis are as follows Foxp1a Q08BX8 BC124513 Foxp1b Q2LE08 NM001039637 Foxp2 Q4JNX5 NM001030082 Foxp3 annotated EST CK028390 Foxp4 annotated. Foxp1 Q9H334 NM001012505 Foxp2 O15409 NM148899 Foxp3 Q9BZS1 NM014009 Foxp4 Q8IVH2 NM138457 Foxp1 P58462 NM053202 Foxp2 P58463 NM053242 Foxp3 Q99JB6 NM054039 Foxp4 Q9DBY0 NM028757 Foxp Q4H3H6. The amino acid sequence of the apparent stickleback orthologues of Foxp1 Foxp2 Foxp3 and Foxp4 were obtained from Ensemb1.

zFoxp3 was cloned from cDNA prepared from zebrafish kidney by using a TOPO PCR cloning kit Invitrogen CA USA according to the manufacturer s instructions.

The amino acids aa predicted to mediate the interaction of the forkhead domain with DNA Stroud et al. Structure. 14 159 66 2006 or the transcription factor NFAT Wu et al. Cell 126 375 87 2006 in mammalian Foxp3 are conserved in zFoxp3 as well as aa found to be mutated in humans with impaired Foxp3 activity Ziegler Annu Rev Immunol. 24 209 26 2006 . The zinc finger leucine zipper domain is important for the homodimerization of Foxp3 and its transcriptional regulatory activities Chae et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103 9631 6 2006 . To study the ability of zFoxp3 to dimerize we designed a pull down assay using His tagged zFoxp3 and a tagged Foxp3 Foxp3 Ren . 293 cells were transfected as described Bettelli et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102 5138 43 2005 and the cells were analyzed after 24 or 48 hours with the dual luciferase assay kit New England Biolabs Ipswich Mass. cells were lysed and zFoxp3 was pulled down with Ni Agarose and the activity in the pellet was quantified . Tk was used for standardization. Alternatively the transfected cells were lysed and immuno precipitation was carried out as described Bettelli et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102 5138 43 2005 hemagglutinin HA labeled NFAT and NF kB were detected with anti HA and anti P65 antibodies obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Santa Cruz Calif. USA .

As shown in zFoxp3 pulled down Foxp3 Ren indicating that zFoxp3 can homodimerize. Hence zFoxp3 has structural features common to mammalian Foxp3.

Foxp3 can physically interact with NK kB and NFAT to down regulate their transcriptional activities Wu et al. 2006 supra Bettelli et al. 2005 supra . As shown in Foxp3 interfered with the activation of NFAT and NF B responsive promoters. This effect was stronger for NF B. Co immunoprecipitation experiments showed that zFoxp3 interacts both with NF kB and NFAT. In agreement with the reduced inhibitory effect of Foxp3 on NFAT driven reporters see the zFoxp3 NFAT interaction was weaker see . These results suggest that zFoxp3 can directly interact with NFAT and NF B to interfere with their transcriptional activities.

MSCV GFP RV retroviral DNA plasmids were transfected into the Phoenix packaging cell line and 72 hours later the retrovirus containing supernatants were collected. MACS purified CD4 T cells were activated 24 hours later with plate bound antibodies to CD3 and CD28 and infected by centrifugation 45 minutes at 2000 rpm with retrovirus containing supernatant supplemented with 8 g ml Polybrene Sigma Aldrich and recombinant human IL 2 25 units ml .

Cells were cultured in serum free X VIVO 20 media Bio Whittaker Walkersville Md. USA for 72 hours. During the last 16 hours cells were pulsed with 1 Ci of H thymidine PerkinElmer Waltham Mass. USA followed by harvesting on glass fiber filters and analysis of incorporated H thymidine in a beta counter 1450 Microbeta Trilux PerkinElmer . Alternatively culture supernatants were collected 48 after activation and the cytokine concentration was determined by ELISA using antibodies for IFN IL 17 IL 4 IL 10 from BD Biosciences and antibodies to TGF from R D Systems. For suppression assays MACS purified CD4 CD25 T cells from na ve C57BL 6 mice 1 5 10cells well were stimulate with antibodies to CD3 and C57BL 6 irradiated spleen cells 0.3 1.5 10cells well for 3 days in the presence of different ratios of CD4GFP retrovirus transduced T cells.

Retroviral transduction of zFoxp3 into mouse T cells led to the up regulation of surface molecules associated with Treg function such as CD25 CTLA 4 and GITR see . Moreover ectopic expression of zFoxp3 in mouse T cells led to a significant decrease in their proliferation and cytokine secretion upon activation with antibodies to CD3 see . Moreover zFoxp3 transduced T cells could inhibit the activation of other T cells both in terms of T cell proliferation and of cytokine secretion in a dose dependent manner see . In summary expression of zFoxp3 in mouse T cells induced a Treg like phenotype. These data suggest that zFoxp3 is a functional homologue of mammalian Foxp3 and that Foxp3 is capable of promoting a Treg like phenotype.

Western blot studies of zebrafish tissues identified a Foxp3 cross reactive protein in thymus kidney and spleen compatible with the predicted size of zFoxp3. The expression of zFoxp3 was then analyzed by real time PCR on FACS sorted lymphocytes myelomonocytes and erythrocytes Traver et al. Nat Immunol 4 1238 46 2003 . RNA was extracted from cells using RNAeasy columns Qiagen Valencia Calif. USA complementary DNA was prepared as recommended Bio Rad Laboratories Hercules Calif. USA and used as template for real time PCR. The expression of Foxp3 was quantified with specific primers and probes Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. USA on the GeneAmp 5500 Sequence Detection System Applied Biosystems . Expression was normalized to the expression of the housekeeping gene GAPDH.

As shown in zFoxp3 expression was restricted to the lymphocyte fraction. This observation is consistent with the expression pattern of mammalian Foxp3 and supports the conservation of the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression that control tissue specificity.

The elements regulating gene expression in genomic DNA are under selective pressure and therefore are more conserved than the surrounding nonfunctional sequences. Phylogenetic footprinting is a method based on the analysis of sequence conservation between orthologous genes from different species to identify regions of DNA involved in the regulation of gene expression. Once identified these conserved regions can be analyzed with TFBS detection algorithms to generate a list of putative TFBS.

We performed a phylogenetic footprinting analysis aimed at identifying regulatory regions within the zebrafish mouse and human Foxp3 gene Ovcharenko et al. Genome Res 15 184 94 2005 . The inclusion of distance species like the zebrafish is highly informative because it facilitates the identification of conserved regulatory sequences amidst DNA regions that were not subjected to any selective pressure Ovcharenko et al. Genome Res 15 184 94 2005 .

The Mulan server mulan.dcode.org was used to perform a phylogenetic footprinting analysis of Foxp3. Mulan brings together different algorithms in a web based user friendly interface programs for the rapid identification of local sequence conservation connected to the multiTF TRANSFAC database for the detection of evolutionarily conserved TFBS in multiple alignments. show the results obtained using the sequences of Foxp3 in rat mouse dog human and zebrafish. Putative TFBS were found for 6 transcription factors all of them known to be expressed and functional in T cells NKX22 AHR EGR1 EGR2 EGR3 NGFIC and Delta EF1. These TF identified by phylogenetic footprinting are other potential regulators of Foxp3 expression and Treg development.

The adaptive cellular immune response of 6 month old zebrafish immunized intraperitoneally ip with heat killed MT or PBS in incomplete Freud s adjuvant IFA was studied.

As shown in spleen cells prepared 14 days after immunization with MT or PBS proliferated in response to stimulation with Concanavalin A ConA but only cells taken from MT immunized fish proliferated upon activation with MT.

Another group of six month old zebrafish were anesthetized with 0.02 tricaine Sigma Aldrich and immunized i.p. with 10 l fish of zebrafish brain homogenate zCNS emulsified in complete Freund s adjuvant CFA . As shown in this resulted in the accumulation of CD3 IFNg and IL 17 expressing cells in the brain.

These results demonstrated that zebrafish can mount adaptive antigen specific cell mediated immune and autoimmune responses.

Using the methods described above a conserved binding site for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor AHR was identified in the genomic sequence of Foxp3 see and which was termed the conserved AHR binding site CABS . A similarly located regulatory sequence controls the expression of the AHR regulated cytochrome P4501A2 CYPIA2 . In addition three non evolutionary conserved AHR binding sites NCABS were identified in the zFoxp3 promoter termed NCABS 1 2 and 3 see and .

First Foxp3 expression was measured in mouse Treg isolated from Foxp3knock in mice. Foxp3knock in mice have a GFP reporter inserted in the Foxp3 gene producing GFP in Foxp3 Treg which facilitates the identification and FACS sorting of GFP Foxp3 Treg Bettelli et al. Nature 441 235 8 2006 .

CD4 T cells were purified from Foxp3gfp knock in mice using anti CD4 beads Miltenyi Auburn Calif. USA and sorted FACSAria cell sorter BD Biosciences into naive CD4 Foxp3 GFP or CD4Foxp3 GFP T cells. CD4 Foxp3 GFP T cells were stimulated with plate bound 1 g ml of anti CD3 145 2C11 eBioscience and 2 g ml of anti CD28 37.51 eBioscience for 5 days. supplemented with recombinant IL 2 50 U ml at day 2 and 4 and analyzed by FACS at day 5 for their differentiation into CD4 Foxp3 GFP Treg. TGF 1 2.5 ng ml was used as a positive control.

Higher levels of AHR expression were detected on FACS sorted CD4 GFP Foxp3 Treg than in CD4 GFP Foxp3 T cells see highlighting a possible link between AHR and Foxp3 expression. The relationship between AHR and Foxp3 was then further analyzed using RT PCR.

Briefly CD4 T cells were purified from Foxp3gfp knock in mice as described above. RNA was then extracted using RNAeasy columns Qiagen Valencia Calif. USA . Complementary DNA was prepared as recommended Bio Rad Laboratories Hercules Calif. USA and used as template for real time PCR. The expression of Foxp3 was quantified with specific primers and probes Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. USA on the GeneAmp 5500 Sequence Detection System Applied Biosystems . Expression was normalized to the expression of the housekeeping genes GAPDH or actin.

Data generated using RT PCR corroborated the observed association between AHR and Foxp3. In addition CYPIA1 expression a AHR responsive gene was also observed in CD4 GFP Foxp3 Treg cells. Furthermore as shown in treatment of the cells with the AHR antagonist resveratol resulted in a significant decrease in both Foxp3 and CYPIA1 expression levels P

To investigate whether AHR directly controls Foxp3 expression we used a bacterial artificial chromosome that contained the entire foxp3 locus tagged with a reporter after the ATG start codon. More specifically we used the RP23 267C15 BAC clone which contains 200 kb of mouse genomic DNA including the entire locus of the Foxp3 gene. A cDNA cassette was the cloned immediately after the ATG start codon of Foxp3 gene by homologous recombination using the Red recombineering system contained in the DY 380 bacteria strain. The final construct was designated BACFoxp3 Ren.

As shown in cotransfection of BACFoxp3 Ren with a construct coding for mouse AHR resulted in a significant up regulation of activity P

Chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP was then applied to analyze the interaction of AHR with the CABS and NCABS shown in and respectively.

Briefly cells were treated for 90 with TCDD fixed with 1 formaldehyde for 15 minutes and quenched with 0.125 M glycine. Chromatin was isolated and sheared to an average length of 300 500 bp by sonication. Genomic DNA input was prepared by treating aliquots of chromatin with RNase proteinase K and heat for de crosslinking followed by ethanol precipitation. AHR bound DNA sequences were immuno precipitated with an AHR specific antibody Biomol SA 210 . Crosslinks were reversed by incubation overnight at 65 C. and ChIP DNA was purified by phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Quantitative PCR reactions were then performed using the following primer pairs 

Experimental Ct values were converted to copy numbers detected by comparison with a DNA standard curve run on the same PCR plates. Copy number values were then normalized for primer efficiency by dividing by the values obtained using Input DNA and the same primer pairs. Error bars represent standard deviations calculated from the triplicate determinations.

ChIP analysis of the interaction of AHR with CABS and NCABS in Foxp3 and CYP1A1 was then performed in control and 2 3 7 8 tetrachlorodibenzo p dioxin TCDD a high affinity AHR ligand treated CD4 T cells and T cells isolated form mice.

TCDD was also used to characterize the functional relationship between AHR and Foxp3. Treatment of 3 day post fertilization zebrafish embryos with TCDD led to a dose dependent increase in zFoxp3 expression expression suggesting that the conserved AHR binding site in the zFoxp3 sequence is functional see .

We then studied the effect of AHR activation on mouse Treg numbers. Na ve C57BL 6 mice were treated with TCDD 1 mg mouse ip and immunized 24 hours later with MOGin CFA. Draining lymph nodes were prepared 10 days later and CD4Foxp3Treg were quantified by FACS. Administration of TCDD led to a small increase in the number of CD4Foxp3 Treg see . Moreover a single administration of TCDD followed by immunization with MOGled to a significant increase in the number of the CD4Foxp3 T cells see . Furthermore the CD4Foxp3 GFP T cells expanded in vivo by TCDD administration and MOGimmunization were functional and showed increased MOG specific suppressive activity see .

To rule out any direct cytotoxic or pro apoptotic effect of TCDD on effector T cells purified mouse CD4CD25 T cells were activated in vitro with antibodies to CD3 in the presence of TCDD. Incubation with TCDD did not increase T cell apoptosis as measured by annexin FITC staining and did not decrease the proliferative response see . Taken together these data suggest that AHR controls Foxp3 expression and Treg expansion both in zebrafish and in mice.

To establish if TCDD triggered the conversion of CD4 Foxp3 T cells into new Foxp3 Treg cells. FACS sorted CD4 Foxp3 GFP T cells were activated in vitro with antibodies to CD3 and CD28 in the presence of TCDD and the generation of CD4 Foxp3 GFP Treg was followed by FACS. TGFb1 was used as a positive control. As shown in TCDD triggered the conversion of approximately 13 of the cells in culture into CD4Foxp3 GFP Treg. Additionally as shown in CD4 Foxp3 GFP Treg induced by TCDD showed a suppressive activity similar to that of Treg induced in vitro with TGF 1 or CD4 Foxp3 GFP Treg sorted from na ve Foxp3gpf mice.

Thus AHR activation by the high affinity AHR ligand TCDD can trigger the conversion of CD4 Foxp3 T cells into functional CD4GFP Treg.

As shown in and treatment with the AHR antagonist resveratrol 50 M interfered with the induction of Treg by TGF 1 and TCDD but had a stronger effect on the Treg conversion triggered by TCDD P 0.0053 . CD4Foxp3 GFP Treg purified from na ve mice did not proliferate and did not show increased suppressive activity upon stimulation with antibodies to CD3 and CD28 and TCDD. These observations suggest that AHR is more important for the differentiation of new Treg than for the activity of established Treg.

To investigate if new Treg could also be generated in vivo following TCDD administration we transferred CD4 Foxp3 GFP 2D2 T cells from CD90.2 donors into wild type CD90.1 recipients. CD4Foxp3 GFP 2D2 T cells express a MOG specific T cell receptor. The recipients were administered 1 g mouse TCDD and were immunized 2 days later with MOG. CD4Foxp3 GFP CD90.2 T cells donor cells that underwent conversion into Treg upon treatment with TCDD were then quantified by FACS. As shown in TCDD promoted a significant P

Thus the increase the frequency of Treg that follows activation of AHR with TCDD is due at least in part to the conversion of CD4Foxp3 GFP T cells into CD4Foxp3 GFP Treg.

To analyze the functionality of the Treg cells induced by AHR activation we studied the effect of TCDD on EAE development.

C57BL 6 mice were given a single intraperitoneal ip does of TCCD and one day later EAE was induced by immunization with MOGin CFA. TCDD was also administered orally 1 g mouse to determined whether an effective dose of this ligand can be delivered via oral administration and whether this dose is capable of reducing EAE development. EAE was induced by injecting the mice subcutaneously with 100 ml of the MOGpeptide MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK SEQ ID NO in complete Freund adjuvant oil. In addition the mice received 150 ng of pertussis toxin Sigma Aldrich ip on days 0 and 2. Clinical signs of EAE were assessed according to the following score 0 no signs of disease 1 loss of tone in the tail 2 hind limb paresis 3 hind limb paralysis 4 tetraplegia 5 moribund.

As shown in and Table 3 ip administered TCDD had a dose dependent effect on the clinical signs of EAE. 1 g mouse markedly inhibited the clinical signs of EAE P

In addition orally administered of 1 g mouse of TCDD one day before EAE induction also prevented EAE development P

To confirm that the effects on EAE were mediated by the activation of AHR we used C57BL 6 mice carrying the d allele of the ahr gene AHR d mice . This allele codes for a mutant AHR with a 10 fold reduction in its affinity for TCDD and other ligands Okey et al. Mol Pharmacol. 35 823 30 1989 due to mutations in its ligand binding sites. The administration of TCDD 1 g mouse to AHR d mice did not increase the levels of CD4 Foxp3 Treg in AHR mt mice and did not inhibit the progression of EAE as shown in and Table 4.

Taken together these results show that TCDD dependent AHR activation can inhibit or suppress the development and or progression of EAE. The data presented in Example 3 indicate that this effect is due to the TCDD dependent AHR activation that promotes the induction of functional Treg.

Antigen microarrays were then used to study the antibody response to myelin in mice that did not develop EAE as consequence of AHR activation by TCDD. The antigens listed in Table 1 were spotted onto Epoxy slides TeleChem Sunnyvale Calif. USA as described Quintana et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 101 Suppl 2 114615 21 2004 . Antigens were spotted in replicates of 6 the microarrays were blocked for 1 h at 37 C. with 1 bovine serum albumin and incubated for 2 hours at 37 C. with a 1 100 dilution of the test serum in blocking buffer. The arrays were then washed and incubated for 45 min at 37 C. with goat anti mouse IgG Cy3 conjugated detection antibodies Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs West Grove Pa. USA . The arrays were scanned with a ScanArray 4000X scanner GSI Luminomics Billerica Mass. USA . Antigen reactivity was defined by the mean intensity of binding to the replicates of that antigen on the microarray. Raw data were normalized and analyzed using the GeneSpring software Silicon Genetics Redwood City Calif. USA with the non parametric Wilcoxon Mann Whitney test using the Benjamini and Hochberg method with a false discovery rate FDR of 0.05 to determine significance. The samples were clustered using a pairwise average linkage algorithm based on Spearman s rank correlation as a distance measure.

The microarrays consisted of a collection of 362 CNS related autoantigens including tissue lysates recombinant proteins peptide libraries spanning the whole sequence of myelin proteins and lipids found in the central and peripheral nervous system a complete list of the antigens used is provided in Table 1.

The control of EAE by AHR activation correlated with a significant decrease in IgG serum antibodies to 97 myelin antigens which are listed in Table 2.

To further characterize the suppression of EAE by AHR activation we studied the activity of myelin specific T cells induced by vaccination with MOG CFA in TCDD treated mice. TCDD treated mice showed a suppressed recall proliferative response to the MOGpeptide however no differences were seen upon activation with antibodies to CD3 see .

In addition cells were stimulated in culture medium containing 100 g ml MOGfor 2 days or with PMA 50 ng ml Sigma Aldrich and ionomycin 1 nM Calbiochem San Diego Calif. USA for 4 hours Golgistop BD Biosciences was added to the culture during the last 4 hours. After staining of surface markers cells were fixed and permeabilized using Cytofix Cytoperm and Perm Wash buffer from BD Biosciences according to the manufacturer s instructions. All antibodies to cytokines IFN gamma IL 17 IL 10 including the corresponding isotype controls were obtained from BD Biosciences. Cells were incubated 1 100 at 25 C. for 20 min and washed twice in Perm Wash before analysis. Data were acquired on a FACSCalibur BD Biosciences and analyzed with FlowJo software Tree Star Ashland Oreg. USA . When compared to the draining lymph node cells from control animals cells from TCDD treated mice secreted higher amounts of TGFb1 and lower amounts of IFNg and IL 17 upon activation with MOG see we did not detect significant amounts of IL 4 or IL 10. Moreover AHR activation with TCDD led to a decrease in the frequency of CD4IL 17 and CD4IFNg T cells in the draining lymph nodes see .

These data suggest that AHR activation interferes with the generation of the encephalitogenic T cell response.

The inhibition of the development of EAE by AHR activation with TCDD was associated with a significant increase in the frequency of CD4Foxp3T cells see . To identify the mechanism responsible for the decreased proliferation to MOGin TCDD treated animals shown in the CD4CD25 Treg population was depleted with magnetic beads. Treg depletion recovered the recall response to MOGin immunized mice treated with TCDD see suggesting that the suppression observed in resulted from the activity of the TCDD treated mice but not with cells isolated from vehicle treated mice P

Further characterization revealed that effector CD4Foxp3 GFP T cells purified from TCDD treated mice showed normal proliferation but significantly decreased secretion of IL 17 and IFN upon activation with MOG see .

To confirm that the protective effect of TCDD on EAE was Treg mediated we depicted the natural Treg with antibodies to CD25 prior to TCDD treatment. The difference between undepleted and depleted cell populations are shown in . TCDD treated mice showed a faster rebound in their Treg numbers P

TFGb1 has been linked to the suppressive activity of Treg in vitro and in vivo Li et al. Annu Rev Immunol. 24 99 146 2006 . To asses the role played by TGFb1 in the inhibition of the recall response to MOGby Treg see and we activated lymph node cells from TCDD treated mice in the presence of blocking antibodies to IL 4 IL 10 TGFb1 or an isotype matched control. shows that incubation with antibodies to TGFb1 but not to IL 4 or IL 10 could recover the recall response to MOG.

To analyze the role played by TFGb1 in vivo in the control of EAE we transferred CD4 T cells from TCDD treated mice into na ve mice expressing a dominant negative variant of the TGFb receptor II on their T cells T cells from these mice are unresponsive to the immunosuppressive effects of TGFb1 Gorelik et al. Immunity 12 171 81 2000 . As shown in transferred Treg cells could control EAE in wild type mice but not in mice harboring T cells unresponsive to TGFb1 P

The observations described herein regarding the control of Treg development by AHR activation suggest that endogenous AHR ligands participate in immune regulation. In support of this we have demonstrated that na ve AHR d mice harbor lower levels of CD4Foxp3 T cells P

Several endogenous AHR ligands are described in the art. Based on our results AHR ligands such as TCDD could be useful in the control of Treg development. Our data additionally demonstrate that AHR ligands such as TCDD can be used to suppress the development and or progression of EAE. Clearly such technology would also be useful in the modulation of other immunological disorders such as autoimmune disorders. Two additional endogenous high affinity ligands for AHR are tryptaime TA Heath Pagliuso et al. Biochemistry. 37 11508 15 1998 a derivative of tryptophan Trp catabolism and 2 1 H indole 3 carbonyl thiazole 4 carboxylic acid methyl ester ITE Song et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 99 14694 9 Epub 2002 Oct. 30 2002 a molecule isolated from the lung. Interestingly no toxicity has been reported for these AHR ligands in vivo probably as a result of their short half life Henry et al. Arch Biochem Biophys. 450 67 77 Epub 2006 Mar. 3 2006 . To confirm the physiologic relevance of AHR activation for the control of Treg activity we tested the effect of TA and ITE on EAE. Based on the short half life of these molecules we administered them on a daily basis. The administration of ITE and not TA led to a significant reduction on EAE severity P

Together these result indicate that modulation of Foxp3 expression by modulating activity of a transcription factor that binds to Foxp3 can be used to affect Treg and control of the immune response in vivo.

Mouse Treg and non Treg were isolated from Foxp3gpf knock in mice mRNA was prepared and Foxp3 see NKX2.2 see EGR1 see EGR2 see and EGR3 see expression was quantified by real time PCR. Foxp3gpf knock in mice have a GFP reporter inserted in the Foxp3 gene producing GFP in Foxp3 Treg and therefore facilitating the identification and FACS sorting of GFP Foxp3 Treg.

GFP CD4 T cells were isolated from Foxp3gpf knock in mice and then were activated in vitro with antibodies to CD3 and CD28 in the presence of TGF 1 to induce Treg differentiation in vitro. mRNA was prepared at the beginning of the experiment and after 3 or 6 days in culture and the expression of Foxp3 see NKX2.2 see EGR1 see EGR2 see and EGR3 see expression was quantified in the Foxp3 GFPCD4 T cells by real time PCR.

These results indicate that expression of Foxp3 and the transcription factors EGR1 EGR2 EGR3 and NKX2.2 is correlated. Taken together the reported effects that these TFs exert on the regulation of gene expression the identification of TF binding sites on the Foxp3 gene and the correlation between the expression of these TF and Fox 3 suggest that EGR1 EGR2 EGR3 and NKX2.2 play a role in the regulation of Foxp3 expression and the generation of Treg.

As shown above TA is rapidly degraded in vivo by monoamine oxidase inhibitors. As shown in when combined with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor trans 2 Phenylcyclopropylamine hydrochloride Tranylcypromine TA effectively suppresses EAE suppression.

This observation suggests that TA is a TCDD like ligand that when used in combination with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor can be used as a transcription factor ligand for promoting an increase in the number and or activity of Treg.

A modified zebrafish based screening assay was established by microinjecting fertilized zebrafish eggs with a BAC construct encoding the complete mouse Foxp3 locus with a reporter inserted after the Foxp3 methionine start codon ATG . Six days after microinjection activity was determined in total zebrafish lysates. As shown in murine Foxp3 was expressed in the microinjected fish as determined by activity. The activity increased in the presence of TCDD in a dose dependent manner.

These data suggest that zebrafish lines encoding murine Foxp3 can be used to screen for small molecules that increase or decrease Foxp3 expression levels.

The ligand activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor AHR is a regulator of zebrafish mouse and human Foxp3 expression and Tdifferentiation Quintana et al. Nature 23 23 2008 . AHR activation by its ligand 2 3 7 8 tetrachlorodibenzo p dioxin TCDD induced Tthat suppressed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE by a TGFb1 dependent mechanism. These findings identify AHR as a therapeutic target of interest for the management of autoimmune disorders but its therapeutic exploitation is limited by the well characterized toxic features of TCDD Baccarelli et al. Environ Health Perspect 110 1169 2002 .

Several endogenous AHR ligands have been isolated among them tryptophan derivatives like tryptaime TA Heath Pagliuso et al. Biochemistry. 37 11508 1998 and the mucosal associated 2 1 H indole 3 carbonyl thiazole 4 carboxylic acid methyl ester ITE depicted in Song et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 99 14694 Nov. 12 2002 . Notably although ITE and have been shown to be high affinity AHR ligands they do not display the toxic effects reported by TCDD Heath Pagliuso et al. 119 supra Henry et al. Arch Biochem Biophys. 450 67 2006 . As demonstrated herein the non toxic AHR ligand ITE administered intraperitoneally orally or with pegylated gold nanoparticles can be used to induce functional T.

To analyze the feasibility of using ITE to activate AHR in vivo in a therapeutic setup we studied the effect of ITE on EAE development. EAE as induced on na ve C57BL 6 mice and ITE 200 mg mice was administered orally or intraperitoneally on daily basis. ITE administration either orally or intraperitoneally resulted in a significant delay on EAE development and a significant reduction of EAE clinical score . Thus AHR activation by ITE induces functional Tthat can control EAE.

To study the mechanism by which the ITE induced Treg control EAE we studied the ability of AHR activation by ITE to induce Treg. We treated na ve C57BL 6 mice with ITE 200 mg mouse administered ip daily and immunized them with 100 mg mouse of MOG35 55 in CFA. Spleens were prepared 10 days later and CD4 FoxP3 Treg were quantified by FACS. Administration of ITE led to a significant increase in the number of CD4 FoxP3 Treg and A B . Notably this increase resulted from the expansion of both CD25 and CD25 CD4 FoxP3 Treg but did lead to significant alterations in the levels of LAP regulatory T cells and A B . Thus AHR activation by ITE results in the expansion of the CD4 FoxP3 Treg compartment.

To confirm the lack of toxicity of ITE we administered it intraperitoneally for 14 days 200 mg mouse and studied the blood levels of biochemical indicators of liver function induction. Hepatocites are known to express high levels of AHR this toxic effects of AHR activation are manifested in the liver. Table 6 shows that at day 14 we did not detect any significant difference in the biochemical indicators of liver function confirming the lack of toxicity in ITE.

To study the feasibility of administering ITE orally to activate AHR and induce functional Treg we treated na ve C57BL 6 mice with ITE 200 mg mouse administered orally daily and immunized them with 100 mg mouse of MOG35 55 in CFA. Spleens were prepared 10 days later and CD4 FoxP3 Treg were quantified by FACS. Administration of ITE led to a significant increase in the number of CD4 FoxP3 Treg and A B . Notably this increase resulted from the expansion of both CD25 and CD25 CD4 FoxP3 Treg but did lead to significant alterations in the levels of LAP regulatory T cells and A B . Thus ITE can be administered orally to activate AHR and expand the CD4 FoxP3 Treg compartment.

To confirm the ability of AHR Activation by ITE to expand the Tcompartment we used Foxp3knock in mine. Foxp3knock in mice have a GFP reporter inserted in the Foxp3 gene producing a GFP Foxp3 fusion protein that facilitates the identification and FACS sorting of GFP FoxP3 T Bettelli et al. Nature 441 235 2006 . Foxp3knock in mice were treated with ITE 200 mg mouse administered ip daily and immunized with 100 mg mouse of MOGin CFA. Ten days later and CD4FoxP3 Twere quantified by FACS. Administration of ITE led to a significant increase in the number of CD4FoxP3GFP Tin blood and spleen and A B . Thus AHR activation by ITE results in the expansion of CD4 FoxP3 Tcompartment.

We then studied the effect of ITE administration on the encephalitogenic response against myelin. EAE was induced on na ve C57BL 6 mice and ITE 200 mg mice was administered orally or intraperitoneally on daily basis. Ten days after vaccination with MOG CFA ITE treated mice showed a suppressed recall proliferative response to the MOGpeptide no differences were seen upon activation with antibodies to CD3 . When compared to the splenocytes from control animals CD4 T cells from ITE treated mice secreted higher amounts of TGFb1 and IL 10 and lower amounts of IL2 IL6 IFNg and IL17 upon activation with MOG . Similar results were observed on the recall response to MOGof mice treated with orally administered ITE .

To confirm the suppressive effects of AHR activation on the generation of T cells secreting IFNg and IL17 IFNg and IL17 CD4 T cells were quantified by FACS in the draining lymph nodes ten days after footpad immunization and intraperitoneal administration of ITE 200 mg mice . AHR activation with ITE led to a decrease in the frequency of CD4IL17 and CD4IFNg T cells . In accordance with these results we found a significant reduction in the secretion of IL 17 and IFNg by lymph node cells from ITE treated mice activated with MOGor aCD3.

To investigate the effect of AHR activation by ITE on the frequency of MOGspecific Tand effector T cells T Foxp3knock in mice were immunized with MOG CFA treated daily with intraperitoneal ITE 200 mg mice and MOG specific T CD4 FoxP3 GFP and T CD4FoxP3 GFP were analyzed by FACS using recombinant MHC class II tetramers containing MBPor the control peptide TMEV. AHR activation with ITE led to a decrease in the frequency of MOG specific Tand to a concomitant increase in the frequency of MOG specific T reducing the MOG specific T Tratio by half .

To investigate the active suppression of MOG specific Teff by Treg Foxp3knock in mice were immunized with MOG CFA treated daily with intraperitoneal ITE 200 mg mice and the recall response to MOGand a mitogenic antibody to CD3 antibody was studied on FACS sorted CD4 T cells and CD4 FoxP3 GFP T. Purified CD4 T cells from ITE treated mice showed a suppressed response to MOGbut not to anti CD3 . This suppressed response to MOGwas lost upon removal of the CD4 FoxP3 GFP T . To further analyze the MOG specific suppressive activity of the CD4 FoxP3 GFP T they were cocultured at different ratios and assayed for the suppression of MOGor anti CD3 triggered proliferation of CD4FoxP3 GFP Tform 2D2 mice which harbor a TCR specific for MOG. CD4FoxP3 GFP T from ITE treated mice displayed an increased MOG specific suppressive activity which could be inhibited with antibodies blocking antibodies to TGRb1 . All in all these data suggests that similarly to what we have described for TCDD AHR activation by ITE results in the expansion of antigen specific CD4 FoxP3 Tthat suppress the encephalitogenic response in a TGFb1 dependent manner.

To demonstrate that the effect of ITE on EAE was mediated by T we purified CD4 T cells from mice protected from EAE by oral or intraperitoneal administration of ITE 14 days after EAE induction. Protection from EAE could be transferred to wild type na ve animals by the transfer of 5 10CD4 T cells ITE treated mice but not with cells isolated from vehicle treated mice . The control of the pathogenic T cell response was mediated by CD4 CD25 T their depletion from the transferred population abrogated the protective effect of the transferred cells. Thus the Tinduced by the activation of AHR with ITE inhibit the progression of EAE.

AHR is known to be expressed by antigen presenting cells APC such as dendritic cells CD11c and macrophages CD11b Vorderstrasse and Kerkvliet Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 171 117 2001 Laupeze et al. J Immunol. 168 2652 2002 Hayashi et al. Carcinogenesis. 16 1403 1995 Komura et al. Mol Cell Biochem. 226 107 2001 . To analyze the effects that AHR activation by ITE might have on different APC populations which can potentially influence the generation of Tand Tcells we studied the effect of ITE and TCDD treatment on MHC class II expression by as dendritic cells CD11c and macrophages CD11b . C57BL 6 mice were treated with ITE 200 mg mouse administered ip daily or TCDD 1 mg mouse administered ip on day 0 and immunized them with 100 mg mouse of MOGin CFA. Spleens were prepared 10 days later and MCH class I expression was investigated on CD11b and CD11c cells by FACS. Administration of ITE or TCDD resulted in a significant decrease in CD11c MHC class II expression which was concomitant with a significant increase in CD11b MHC class II expression which was concomitant with a significant increase in CD11b MHC class II expression . Since CD11c MHC II and CD11b MHC II have been recently linked to the induction of Tand T respectively these results suggest that changes in the different APC populations might contribute to the immunomodulatory effects of AHR activation by ITE.

As noted above administration of a single dose of 1 mg mouse of the AHR ligand TCDD could prevent the development of EAE. To achieve similar effects on disease progression 200 mg mouse of ITE have to be administered daily throughout the experiment. ITE is a tryptophan derivative which is thought to have a short half life in vivo as a result of the activity of specific enzymes. Indeed administration of ITE at weekly intervals instead of daily results in a complete loss of its protective effects on EAE .

Gold colloid has been in use for over 50 years in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis these gold colloid nanoparticles have been shown to have little to no long term toxicity or adverse effects Paciotti et al. Drug Deliv. 11 169 2004 . Due to their small size 10 100 nm diameter gold colloid nanoparticles have large surface areas on which multiple small proteins or other molecules can be conjugated Paciotti et al. Drug Deliv. 11 169 2004 . The PEGylation of gold colloid nanoparticles greatly enhances the overall stability of the molecule to which it is covalently bonded Qian et al. Nat Biotechnol. 26 83 2008 . Moreover recently it has been shown that PEGylated gold colloid nanoparticles can be linked to specific antibodies to target them to specific cell types Qian et al. Nat Biotechnol 26 83 2008 . Thus to increase the half life of ITE and to facilitate its targeting to specific cell types we constructed polyethylene glycol coated PEGylated gold colloid nanoparticles loaded with AHR ligands .

PEGylated gold colloid nanoparticles carrying the AHR ligands FICZ ITE or TCDD showed a typical spectrum of optical absorption . Moreover FICZ ITE or TCDD loaded nanoparticles activated luciferase expression on an AHR reporter cell line to levels similar to those achieved by 10 nm TCDD.

To investigate the in vivo functionality of AHR ligand loaded nanoparticles we induced EAE on na ve C57BL 6 mice and treated them starting at day 0 weekly with 45 femtomoles of nanoparticles. Similarly to what we have described in our previous experiments treatment with TCDD resulted in a complete suppression of EAE while the AHR ligand FICZ worsened the disease . Weekly administration of ITE loaded nanoparticles resulted in a significant inhibition of EAE development . Thus the administration of ITE using nanoparticles augments its suppressive effect on EAE compare .

To study the effect of ITE loaded nanoparticles on the Tcompartment we induced EAE on na ve C57BL 6 mice and treated them staring at day 0 weekly with 45 femtomoles of nanoparticles. Spleens were prepared 21 days after EAE induction and CD4FoxP3 Twere quantified by FACS. Administration of ITE loaded nanoparticles led to a significant increase in the number of CD4FoxP3 T this increase resulted from the expansion of both CD25 and CD25 CD4FoxP3 T . Thus ITE loaded nanoparticles can be used to activate AHR and expand the Tcompartment.

To study the mechanism by which the ITE based nanoparticles control EAE we studied the activity of myelin specific T cells. We inducted EAE on na ve C57BL 6 mice and treated them starting at day 0 weekly with 45 femtomoles of nanoparticles. Spleens were prepared 21 days after EAE wad induced and analyzed for their recall response to MOGand anti CD3. Mice treated with ITE loaded nanoparticles showed a suppressed recall proliferative response to the MOGpeptide FIG. no differences were seen upon activation with antibodies to CD3 . When compared to the splenocytes from control animals CD4 T cells from mice treated with ITE loaded nanoparticles secreted higher amounts of TGFb1 and IL 10 and lower amounts of IL2 IL6 IFNg and IL17 upon activation with MOG .

To investigate the potential of AHR targeting for the induction of human Twe activated purified na ve CD4 CD62L CD45RO T cells for healthy donors for 5 days with antibodies to CD3 and CD28 in the presence of TCDD 100 nM or TGFb1 2.5 ng ml or both. T cell activation in the presence of TCDD resulted in the induction of CD4 FoxP3 T cells in some but not all human samples .

To study the functionality of the putative human Tinduced in the presence of TCDD we studied their suppressive activity of CD4 CD25and CD4 CD25T cells following 5 days of activation in the of TCDD or TGFb1 2.5 ng ml or both. Activation in the presence of TGFb1 did not result in the induction of suppressive T cells . However activation in the presence of TCDD led to the generation of both CD4 CD25and CD4 CD25functional human regulatory T cells as shown by their ability to inhibit the proliferation of responder T cells . This effect of TCDD was amplified in the presence of TGFb1 as shown by the increased suppressive activity of the T cells generated under these conditions .

To investigate the mechanism mediating the suppressive activity of the TCDD induced T we analyzed them by real time PCR for the expression of several genes that have been previously linked to the suppressive function of T. FoxP3 expression was significantly up regulated upon activation in the presence of TCDD and TGFb1 however it was also induced buy TGFb1 alone suggesting that FoxP3 expression does not correlate with the induction of suppressive function via AHR activation. This is confirmed by the marginal induction of FoxP3 expression triggered by AHR activation with TCDD in the absence of TGFb1 although these cells expressed low levels of FoxP3 were suppressive in co culture assays . TGFb1 also up regulated AHR expression levels several fold over the basal levels observed on T cells however the AHR expression levels also did not correlate with the induction of suppressive activity as shown in co culture assays . Strikingly TCDD treated expressed increased levels of IL 10 which where complete inhibited by TGFb1 Accordingly IL 10 specific blocking antibodies could interfere with the suppressive activity of Tinduced with TCDD but not the of those induced with TGFb1 and TCDD . Thus TCDD induced CD4CD25T cells are FoxP3 regulatory cells whose suppressive activity is mediated at least partially via IL 10 resembling the phenotype of type 1 T Roncarolo et al. Immunol Rev. 212 28 2006 Roncarolo and Gregori Eur J Immunol. 38 925 2008 .
