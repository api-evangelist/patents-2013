For example a particular example URI http my servercom maps satellite lat 123 long 456 or http my server.com images etc. may correspond to the example URI item because the particular example URI s meets the URI pattern of the particular example URI item.

It is to be understood that when the present disclosure refers to for example comparing a particular URI with a particular URI item to determine whether the particular URI corresponds to the particular URI item the present disclosure is not limited to any particular implementation of a comparison methods. Specifically the comparing of a URI with a URI item is not limited to any particular comparison method. The comparing of a URI with a URI item is not limited to a direct comparison e.g. an exact match but instead encompasses a variety of comparison methods. The comparison may comprise a URI pattern matching and or other comparison methods. Furthermore when the present disclosure refers to determining whether a particular URI corresponds to a particular URI item it is to be understood that the correspondence includes a direct e.g. through a direct comparison method and or a pattern correspondence e.g. through a pattern matching comparison method . For example a particular URI may correspond to a particular URI item if the particular URI either directly corresponds to the URI item and or the particular URI meets a URI pattern represented by the particular URI item.

The present disclosure is not limited to a particular implementation of a resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest resource item s a URI whitelist e.g. the URI whitelist and or URI item s . Specifically the present disclosure is not limited to for example an implementation of resource manifest and or a URI whitelist as a list of items resource or URI respectively. It is to be understood that other implementations that are within the scope of the present disclosure include various implementations that may allow an application server e.g. the application server and or an electronic device e.g. the electronic device to receive and or process the resource manifest and or the URI whitelist associated with a particular application e.g. the application .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application may be associated with more than one of each of the resource manifest and or the URI whitelist . For example the application may be intended to be used on different types of electronic devices e.g. a gaming platform a smartphone a tablet etc. and or types of operating environments e.g. an operating system . The application may be associated with one resource manifest and or URI whitelist with respect to one device type e.g. a smartphone and or an operating environment and another resource manifest and or URI whitelist with respect to another device type e.g. a tablet and or an operating environment.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application may be associated with more than one resource manifest but with one URI whitelist. For example a declaration of resources that the application may require access to may be device type specific and or operating environment specific while a declaration of URI items may be generic. For example the declaration of URI items on a URI whitelist may comprise of one or more URI items where some or all of the one or more URI items may correspond to a network resource that can be identified referenced and or accessed by a device and or an operating environment irrespective of the type of the device and or the operating environment.

The communication network may comprise any combination of wired and or wireless protocols standards and or interfaces e.g. Ethernet Bluetooth WiFi satellite and or cellular network WiMAX WLAN NFC etc. that enable communication between electronic devices e.g. the electronic device servers e.g. the application server and or other computing devices and or entities e.g. the developer entity .

Specifically the communication of various devices servers and or entities e.g. the electronic device the application server the developer entity with each other e.g. directly and or on the communication network on and or with the communication network does not need to occur on a particular communication link e.g. the communication link and or . It is to be understood that the communication network the communication links and or have been used for illustration purposes only and do not limit the present disclosure to any particular implementation of a communication network and or communication links that may allow for communication between various devices servers and or entities consistent with the present disclosure.

Referring to there is shown a plurality of actions a submit action an approve a release a download action and or a control access action . The submit action may be performed by the developer entity . The approve action and or the release action may be performed by the application server . The download action and or the control access action may be performed by the electronic device .

In operation a developer entity such as for example the developer entity may perform a submit action e.g. the submit action . In this regard the developer entity may send to an application server such as for example the application server a request to approve an application e.g. the application for release of the application in an application store. The request may comprise an application e.g. the application a representation of an application e.g. executable instructions and or code that may make the application operable on an electronic device and or application data. The application data may for example comprise a resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest and or a URI whitelist e.g. the URI whitelist associated with the application e.g. the application . The application data may also comprise other developer and or application related data e.g. developer name developer identifier application version application category application executable instructions etc. .

In operation an application server such as for example the application server may perform an approval action e.g. the approval action . The approval action may be performed in response to a submit action e.g. the submit action that may have been performed at an earlier time by a developer entity such as for example the developer entity . The approval action may not immediately follow a submit action. In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may have received one or more applications for approval for release in an application store from one or more developer entities e.g. developer entity . The application server may perform an approval action with respect to all or some of the one or more applications at the same time or at different times.

During an approval action the application server may for example determine whether an application e.g. the application may be approved for release in an application store. In this regard the application server may analyze the application and or the application data that may have been received from a developer entity e.g. the developer entity during for example a submit action e.g. the submit action . The analysis may be based on for example a resource manifest and or a URI whitelist associated with the application where the resource manifest and the URI whitelist may have been received as part of for example the application data.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may analyze the resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest to determine whether resource items associated with the resource manifest are for example necessary and or reasonable with respect to resources of an electronic device e.g. the electronic device to which an access may be requested during an operation and or execution of the application. For example a social networking application may be associated with a resource manifest that for example includes resource items corresponding to the following example resources of an electronic device network camera interface contact list system settings etc. The application server may determine that for example an access to the network and or camera interface resources may be necessary and or reasonable and or that an access to the contact list and or the system setting resources may not be necessary and or reasonable for the example social networking application.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may analyze the URI whitelist e.g. the URI whitelist to determine whether URI items associated with the URI whitelist are for example necessary and or reasonable with respect to network resources to which an access may be requested during an operation and or execution of the application. For example a social networking application may be associated with a URI whitelist that for example includes URI items corresponding to the following example network resources http www.my social life.com http www.sell personl data.com etc. The application server may determine that for example an access to the network resource http www.my social life.com may be necessary and or reasonable and or that an access to the network resource http www.sell personal data.com which may for example be associated with a known and or determinable malicious network resource may not be necessary and or reasonable for the example social networking application.

The determination of whether an access by an application to a particular resource and or network resource may be necessary and or reasonable may be based on a variety of criteria such as for example the type of the application the developer entity with which the application is associated the type of a resource and or network resource to which access is requested etc.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may not approve an application which may be associated with a resource manifest where one or more resource items associated with the resource manifest correspond to a resource of an electronic device to which access by the application may not be necessary and or reasonable. For example the application server may not approve the example social networking application because for example access to the contact list and or the system settings resources of an electronic device may not be necessary and or reasonable for the example social networking application.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may not approve an application which may be associated with a URI whitelist where one or more URI items associated with the URI whitelist correspond to a network resource to which access by the application may not be necessary and or reasonable. For example the application server may not approve the example social networking application because for example access to the network resource http www.sell personal data.com may not be necessary and or reasonable for the example social networking application.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may approve an application with a modified resource manifest. In this regard even though the application may be associated with a resource manifest where one or more resource items disapproved resource items associated with the resource manifest correspond to a resource of an electronic device to which access by the application may not be necessary and or reasonable the application server may modify the resource manifest and may remove the disapproved resource items associated with the resource manifest. For example the application server may approve the example social networking application with a modified resource manifest where the modified resource manifest may not include the resource items corresponding to the contact list and or system settings resources.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may approve an application with a modified URI whitelist. In this regard even though the application may be associated with a URI whitelist where one or more URI items disapproved URI items associated with the URI whitelist correspond to a network resource to which access by the application may not be necessary and or reasonable the application server may modify the URI whitelist and may remove the disapproved URI items associated with the URI whitelist. For example the application server may approve the example social networking application with a modified URI whitelist where the modified URI whitelist may not include the URI items corresponding to the http www.sell personl data.com network resource.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure during an approval action the application server may communicate application receipt data to the developer entity associated with that application . In this regard the application receipt data may comprise data and or information indicative of whether the application was approved for release in an application store.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may approve an application with a modified resource manifest and or URI whitelist as previously described automatically and or conditionally. For example in an automatic approval the application server may approve an application with a modified resource manifest and or URI whitelist based on for example only a submit action e.g. the submit action . For example in a conditional approval the application server may communicate to a developer entity e.g. the developer entity data and or information indicating that the application may be approved for release in an application store if the developer entity approves the modified resource manifest and or the modified URI whitelist. The data and or information may be a part of an application receipt data.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure when an application e.g. application was not approved and or was conditionally approved for release in an application store the application receipt data may comprise data and or information indicative of for example one or more reasons for denial to release the application in an application store. For example the one or more reasons for denial may be related to a resource manifest e.g. resource manifest and or URI whitelist e.g. URI whitelist associated with the application .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application receipt data may comprise for example an option and or instructions to automatically and or manually modify a resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest and or a URI whitelist e.g. the URI whitelist associated with the application such that the application may be in a condition for approval for release in an application store as a result of the modification s . The option may be associated with the conditional approval as previously described e.g. an approval of an application with a modified resource manifest and or a modified URI whitelist .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure an example automatic option to modify a resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest and or a URI whitelist e.g. the URI whitelist associated with the application may be associated with for example providing an automated method for the developer entity to send to the application server a request to automatically modify the resource manifest and or the URI whitelist based on for example modifications proposed by the application server that may have been communicated to the developer entity along with for example the application receipt data. For example the application server may communicate to the developer entity a message including for example a hyperlink and or any other method that may allow the developer entity associated with the application to send a request to the application server to automatically modify the resource manifest and or the URI whitelist.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the message may be an e mail message. The e mail message may comprise for example a representation of a proposed resource manifest modification and or a proposed URI whitelist modification that may bring the application into a condition for allowance for release in the application store. The e mail message may provide an option to the developer entity to respond to the proposed resource manifest and or the proposed URI whitelist modification. In an example embodiment of the disclosure the option may be an option to automatically modify the resource manifest and or the URI whitelist by replacing the resource manifest and or the URI whitelist with the proposed resource manifest and or the proposed URI whitelist respectively and or by accepting modifications to the resource manifest and or the URI whitelist.

The option may be in a form of for example a hyperlink a shortcut and any other method that would facilitate an automated e.g. without custom user input communication between the developer entity and the application server . For example if the option is in a form of a hyperlink the developer entity may process the hyper link e.g. automatically though an API that may allow communication between the developer entity and the application server manually though a user interaction selecting and or interacting with the hyperlink etc. . The processing of the hyperlink may cause the developer entity to send to the application server a message such as for example an automatically generated e mail and or any other communication that may be received and or processed by the application server .

In another example embodiment of the disclosure the option may be in a form of a text communication. For example the text communication may direct the developer entity to for example log into a developer account associated with the developer entity . It is to be understood that the text communication may also include for example an option to automatically log into the developer account by for example opening a developer interface e.g. a web browser interface etc. and or re directing to a developer interface that may provide an option for the developer entity to respond to the proposed modifications to the resource manifest and or the URI whitelist.

In operation an application server such as for example the application server may perform a release action e.g. the release action . The release action may be performed in response to an approval action e.g. the approval action that may have been performed at an earlier time by the application server .

During a release action the application server may release an application e.g. the application to an application store. The application may be released to an application store if for example the application was approved for release during an approval action e.g. the approval action .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure during a release action the application server may send application receipt data to the developer entity associated with that application . In this regard the application receipt data may comprise data and or information indicative of whether and or when the application may be released in an application store.

In operation an electronic device such as for example the electronic device may perform a download action e.g. the download action . The download action may be performed in response to for example a request by the electronic device e.g. through user input to for example download and or purchase an application e.g. the application . The download action may be performed with respect to one or more applications e.g. the application that may be available in an application store e.g. an application store managed and or supported by an application server such as for example the application server and or suitable for consumption of the electronic device e.g. supported by the electronic device the electronic device s operating system etc. .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure when an application e.g. the application is downloaded to an electronic device the application may be downloaded with an associated resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest and or an associated URI whitelist e.g. the URI whitelist .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the contents e.g. items of a resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest and or a URI whitelist e.g. the URI whitelist associated with an application e.g. the application that for example is intended to be downloaded to an electronic device e.g. the electronic device may be revealed to a user of the electronic device for example before and or after the application is purchased and or downloaded. In an example embodiment of the disclosure the contents may be available for review to the user when the user requests the review e.g. though an interface associated with an application store and or a graphical user interface GUI that may allow the user to review the application change the applications settings etc. 

In an example embodiment of the disclosure a user of an electronic device e.g. the electronic device may have a full and or limited control over resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest and or a URI whitelist e.g. the URI whitelist associated with an application e.g. the application installed on e.g. downloaded to the electronic device . For example the user may be able to modify the contents e.g. items of the resource manifest and or the URI whitelist after an application was downloaded e.g. the download action to the electronic device.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the user may be able to for example toggle e.g. enable disable allow disallow turn on off etc. access by an application e.g. the application to a particular resource e.g. an item associated with the resource manifest and or a particular network resource e.g. an item associated with the URI whitelist . A user may be able to toggle access at various times such as for example when an application is downloaded to the electronic device e.g. the download action when the application request access to a particular recourse and or network resource e.g. a user may be presented with a prompt to allow and or deny access and or at any other time e.g. by accessing settings associated with the application . The toggle action may provide a user with a customized access approval process to resources and or network resources that may have been previously evaluated and or approved by an application server e.g. the application server during for example an application approve e.g. the approve action and release e.g. the release action process.

In operation an electronic device such as for example the electronic device may perform a control access action e.g. the control access . The control access action may be performed in response to for example a request by an application e.g. the application running and or executing on an electronic device to access a particular resource on the electronic device and or a network resource.

For example the control access action may be performed when an application requests access to a particular resource of an electronic device such as for example a network resource. During the control access action the electronic device may detect that an application requested access to the network. The electronic device may determine whether the application may be granted access to the network by analyzing a resource manifest associated with the application. For example if one of the resource items of the resource manifest corresponds to the network the electronic device may grant the application access to the network.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure when an application requests access to the network and for example is granted such access based on a resource manifest the electronic device may determine to what particular network resource the application requests access. For example the application may request to access an example network resource http my app.com . In this regard the electronic device may analyze a URI whitelist to determine whether the particular network resource e.g. http my app.com corresponds to one or more URI items. If the particular network resource correspond to one or more URI items e.g. by exact URI match and or a URI pattern match access to the particular network resource may be granted. Otherwise the access to the particular network resource may be denied e.g. even if the application may have been granted access to the network based on the resource manifest associated with the application .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure a malicious application e.g. an application intended to compromise security of an electronic device and or data including personal user data may be prevented from compromising security of an electronic device on which it is installed e.g. to which it is downloaded and or on which it executes and or of sensitive data and or personal user data e.g. e mail account information passwords contact list etc. . In this regard when a malicious application e.g. the application is submitted e.g. the submit action by a developer entity e.g. the developer entity to an application server e.g. the application server for an approval for release in an application store the application may have to be associated with a resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest and or a URI whitelist the URI whitelist . During an approval process e.g. the approval action the application server may determine that the application submitted for approval is malicious based on the content e.g. items of the resource manifest and or the URI whitelist. The application server may not approve the application for release in an application store based on the determination that the application is malicious.

In an example embodiment of the discourse a well intentioned application e.g. a non malicious application may be compromised after it has already been approved for release e.g. the approve action and or released e.g. the release action to an application store. For example a well intentioned application may be downloaded e.g. the download action to an electronic device e.g. the electronic device . The well intentioned application may be compromised by for example another application a code bug in the well intentioned application and or another application etc. In this regard when the compromised well intentioned application requests access to a malicious network resource e.g. due to malicious activity affecting the application the electronic device may not approve access to the malicious network resource. Specifically when the well intentioned application was approved for release and or released to an application store it may have been associated with a resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest and or a URI whitelist the URI whitelist . Because the application was well intentioned the URI whitelist may not include a URI item corresponding to the malicious network resource. The electronic device during for example an access control action e.g. the access control action may determine that the malicious network resource does not correspond to any URI items associated with the URI whitelist and may not approve the application to access the malicious network resource.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure a well intentioned application as previously described may be compromised by accessing an approved network resource e.g. a particular network resource that may correspond to a URI item on the URI whitelist associated with the well intentioned application where the approved network resource may have been compromised itself by for example a malicious attack on a host e.g. my app.com etc. associated with the approved network resource. In this regard the electronic application may approve the well intentioned application s request to access the network e.g. where the network corresponds to one or more resource items associated with a resource manifest associated with the well intentioned application and or to a particular network resource e.g. where the particular network resource corresponds to one or more URI items associated with a URI whitelist associated with the well intentioned application . The electronic device may monitor the well intentioned application s access to the network and or to the particular network resource e.g. http my app.com . In this regard the electronic device may determine that for example an access to the particular network resource e.g. http my app.com resulted in a re direct from the particular network resource e.g. http my app.com to a malicious network resource e.g. http steal my data.com for example because the particular network resource was compromised. The electronic device may prevent the well intentioned application s access to the malicious network resource by for example not approving the well intentioned application s access to the particular network resource that may correspond to one or more approved URI items e.g. URI items associated with the URI whitelist associated with the well intentioned application .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure an electronic device e.g. the electronic device may monitor resource s of the electronic device to determine whether a particular application e.g. application requested access to a particular resource.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the electronic device e.g. the electronic device may monitor a resource of the electronic device associated with the network to determine whether a particular application e.g. application requested access the network. If the particular application requested access to the network the electronic device may monitor the particular application and or the network to determine whether the application requested access to a particular network resource. For example the electronic device may detect that a particular application is attempting to access a particular network resource. In this regard the electronic application may grant access to the particular network resource e.g. if the particular network resource corresponds to a URI item associated with a URI whitelist e.g. the URI whitelist associated with the application .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure an electronic device e.g. the electronic device may monitor applications on the electronic device to determine whether a particular application e.g. application requested access to a particular resource and or a network resource.

In this regard the electronic application may grant access to the particular resource e.g. if the particular resource corresponds to a resource item associated with a resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest associated with the application and or network resource e.g. if the particular network resource corresponds to a URI item associated with a URI whitelist e.g. the URI whitelist associated with the application .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure a request by an application e.g. the application to access a particular resource and or a network resource may be generated by the application and or may occur in response and or as a consequence of the application execution of a particular function. For example an application may request access to a particular resource and or network resource before it accesses the particular resource and or the network resource and or at the time of accessing e.g. attempting to access the particular resource and or the network resource. In another example embodiment of the disclosure the application may initiate execution of a function which for example may in turn require access to a particular resource and or a network resource. In another example embodiment of the disclosure the application may call a system function e.g. associated with for example an operating system of the electronic device that may be associated with a particular resource and or a network resource.

The application server may e.g. the application server in response to the communication about the suspicious activity and or a pre determined number of communications regarding the same application communicate with the developer entity e.g. the developer entity associated with the application to notify the developer entity that for example the application may have been compromised e.g. due to a bug in application code due to an attack on a host that an application is otherwise authorized to access etc. .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may provide and or manage developer registration services. A developer entity such as for example the developer entity may register with the registration authentication services provided by the application server by for example creating a developer account. The registration services may provide for example for a graphical user interface GUI where a user associated with the developer entity may initiate a registration process for the developer entity .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may provide and or manage developer authentication services. For example during an application approval process the application server may provide a prompt to a user associated with the developer entity for authentication data and or information. The developer entity e.g. in response to user input and or a predefined criteria may send the authentication data and or information to the application server for authenticating the developer entity .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may automatically authenticate the developer entity when for example the developer entity itself e.g. without a user s intervention or through a user associated with the developer entity sends a request to the application server for the application server to approve an application for releasing in an application store. In this regard when the application server receives the request the application server may verify the identity of the developer entity . For example the application server may initiate and or perform a search on a developer database to determine whether the developer entity corresponds to a particular developer entity and authenticate the particular developer entity based on the correspondence.

Although actions and or may have been illustrated in sequence the present disclosure is not limited in this way. For example an application may be submitted e.g. the submit action by a developer entity to an application server and the application server may not immediately respond to the submit action with for example an approval action e.g. the approval action . For example the application server may proceed with approving or disapproving applications from release in an application store based on the submit actions in sequence e.g. first in first out etc. and or based on application priority e.g. an application associate with for example a particular category particular developer entity etc. may have priority over another application associated with a different category and or a different developer etc. .

In another example the AMS may send one request to the application approval module for any combination of the one or more application approval criteria.

In an example me embodiment of the disclosure the AMS may determine that the request comprises a resource manifest and or a URI whitelist associated with the application subject to the request for approval.

Based on the determination the AMS may determine that one or more application security criteria apply such as for example necessity and or reasonableness of contents e.g. items associated with the resource manifest and or the URI whitelist .

In this regard AMS may request from the application approval module for the application approval module to analyze the resource manifest the URI whitelist and or their respective contents to determine whether they meet one or more application security criteria.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application approval module may analyze the resource manifest to determine whether the contents of the resource manifest e.g. resource items associated with the resource manifest are for example necessary and or reasonable with respect to resources of an electronic device to which an access may be requested during an operation and or execution of the application.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application approval module may analyze the URI whitelist to determine whether the contents of the URI whitelist e.g. URI items associated with the URI whitelist are for example necessary and or reasonable with respect to network resources to which an access may be requested during an operation and or execution of the application.

The application approval module may communicate with the AMS . In this regard the application approval module may send to the AMS data and or information indicative of whether one or more application approval criteria may be met e.g. the one or more application approval criteria that where the subject of a request from the AMS to the application approval module .

The AMS may determine based on for example the data and or information received from the application approval module whether an application may be released to the application store.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the AMS may add and or modify an entry in an application database such as for example the application database where the entry may indicate that the application may or may not be approved for release in an application store.

The AMS may request from the communication subsystem for the communication subsystem to send to the developer entity a notification which may comprise application receipt data. The application receipt data may comprise data and or information indicative of whether the application may be released to the application store.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may use a variety of different communication methods to communicate with the developer entity. For example the communication subsystem may based on for example a request from the AMS send to the developer entity an e mail message e.g. to an e mail address associated with the developer entity where the e mail address may be retrieved from for example the developer database and or another message that may be received and or retrieved by the developer entity e.g. a message in an application that may support communication between the developer entity and the application server through for example an API and or on line interface e.g. web browser interface .

In operation the application server may be operable to release an application to an application store. The application may be released to an application store if for example the application was approved for release during an approval process as performed by for example the ACS and or the application approval module . In this regard the AMS may request from the application store module for the application store module to release an approved application to an application store. For example the application store module may add and or modify an entry in an application database such as for example the application database where the entry may indicate that the application may be available in the application store e.g. available for browsing purchasing downloading etc. .

In operation the application server may be operable to receive from an electronic device a request to purchase and or download an application from an application store. In this regard the communication subsystem may receive and or process the request and may send the request processed or unprocessed to the AMS . The request may comprise download related data e.g. data about the requested application the type of the operating system on the electronic device the type of the electronic device etc. that may be relevant to the purchasing and or downloading of the application. The AMS may analyze the request to prepare the application and or application data for download to the electronic device. For example the AMS may determine a version of the application that may have to be prepared for purchasing and or download based on for example an operating system of the electronic device the type of the electronic device e.g. smartphone tablet etc. .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the AMS may send to the electronic device the application executable instructions for downloading and or installing the application e.g. from an application server such as for example the application server or a third party server such as for example a developer entity associated with the application and or application data e.g. a resource manifest a URI whitelist etc. .

The components of the application server such as for example the main processor the memory the communication subsystem and or the AMS may be implemented in an integrated or a distributed system. An integrated system may be implemented for example on one computer server machine or device where the integrated system may be configured to perform some or all of the functions features and or operations of the main processor the memory the communication subsystem and or the AMS as described herein. A distributed system may be implemented with multiple components e.g. computers servers machines and or devices where each of the multiple components may be configured to perform some or all of the functions features and or operations of the main processor the memory the communication subsystem and or the AMS as described herein. Each function feature and or operation may be implemented on one or more of the components of the distributed system. For example a specific feature function and or operation may be implemented on one component of the distributed system or it may be implemented across multiple components of the distributed system.

The application e.g. the application may be associated with a resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest as depicted in and or described with respect to and or a URI whitelist e.g. the URI whitelist as depicted in and or described with respect to .

The resource manifest may comprise one or more resource items such as for example the resource item s . A resource item e.g. resource item s may correspond to a resource on the electronic device e.g. the electronic device on which the applications is operating. Example resource item s may comprise example resource items s . The resource item s may comprise resource items though N e.g. Item Item  . . . Item N . An example Item  may correspond to network e.g. an internet network a Wi Fi connection a LAN connection etc. . An example Item  may correspond to a camera interface. An example Item N may correspond to a contact list.

The URI whitelist may comprise one or more URI items such as for example the URI item s . A URI item may correspond to a network resource which may be for example accessible through a network. The access may be facilitated by the electronic device e.g. the electronic device if for example access to the network is granted to the applications by the electronic device. Example URI item s may comprise example URI items s . The URI item s may comprise URI items though N e.g. Item Item  . . . Item N . An example Item  may correspond to a network location http my server.com . An example Item  may correspond to a network location http my app.com . An example Item N may correspond to a network location http my update.com .

In operation the applications may request from the electronic device to access a particular network resource through an example request and or . The electronic device may receive and or process the request through for example a resource control module such as for example the resource control module RCM as depicted in and or described with respect to .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application may request to access one or more network location s e.g. request s . For each of the example network access requests the RCM may analyze the resource manifest and may determine that the application may be granted network access because for example the example resource Item  of the resource item s corresponds to the network.

In the example network access request the application may request to access an example network location http my server.com . The RCM may analyze the URI whitelist and may determine that the application may be granted access to the example network location http my server.com because for example the example network location http my server.com corresponds to example URI Item  of the URI item s .

In the example network access request the application may request to access an example network location http my app.com files . The RCM may analyze the URI whitelist and may determine that the application may be granted access to the example network location http my app.com files because for example the example network location http my app.com files corresponds to a pattern of network locations corresponding example URI Item  of the URI item s . In an example embodiment of the disclosure the RCM may monitor the network access by the application to for example determine whether the access to the example network location http my app.com results in fact in access to the same example network location. In a case where for example upon access to the approved example network location e.g. http my app.com files a redirect e.g. intermediate redirect request occurs the RCM may detect the redirect e.g. to http bed server files and may analyze whether the redirect may result in access to a network location that may correspond to an approved URI item. In this example the RCM may determine that the redirect request may result in access to a network location http bad server.com files . The RCM may analyze the URI whitelist and may determine that the application may not be granted access to the example redirect network location http bed server files because for example the example redirect network location http bed server files does not corresponds to any of the example URI item s .

In the example network access request the application may request to access an example network location http bad server.com . The RCM may analyze the URI whitelist and may determine that the application may not be granted access to the example network location because for example the example network location http bad server.com does not corresponds to any of the example URI item s .

In an example step a request to approve an application for release in an application store may be received. The request may be received from an application developer e.g. a developer entity such as for example the developer entity . The request may comprise the application and or application data. The application data may comprise a resource manifest and or a URI whitelist.

In an example step the request may be analyzed based on for example the application data. For example the resource manifest and or the URI whitelist may be analyzed. In this regard a determination may be made whether contents e.g. items of the resource manifest and or the URI whitelist may be necessary and or reasonable with respect to for example the application type category etc.

In an example step a determination whether the application may be approved for release in the application store may be made based on for example the determination made in the example step . For example if the resource items associated with the resource manifest and or the URI items associated with the URI whitelist are necessary and or reasonable the application may be approved for release in the application store. The present disclosure is not limited to the steps in the example method .

In an example step a request to access a particular URI may be received from an application. For example an application running and or executing on an electronic device may request access to a particular network resource e.g. a particular URI .

In an example step a determination of a resource associated with the particular URI may be made. For example a URI may be associated with a network. In this regard the determination may be made that access to the particular URI requires access to the network e.g. the network may correspond to a resource on the electronic device .

In an example step a determination of a resource manifest associated with the application may be made. The resource manifest may comprise one or more resource items where some or all of the one or more resource items may correspond to one or more resources of the electronic device e.g. camera interface contest list network etc. .

In an example step a determination of whether the resource corresponds to at least one of the one or more resource items may be made. In this regard the resource determined in the example step may be compared with one or more resource items in the resource manifest to determine whether the resource corresponds to at least one of the one or more resource items. For example if the resource determined in the example step is a network e.g. access to the particular URI requires access to the network and for example one of the one or more resource items also corresponds to a network then a determination may be made that the resource corresponds to at least one of the one or more resource item e.g. an resource item corresponding to the network .

If the resource corresponds to at least one of the one or more resource items the example steps continue at the example step . If the resource does not correspond to any one of the one or more resource items the example steps continue at the example step .

In an example step a determination of a URI whitelist associated with the applications may be made. The URI whitelist may comprise one or more URI items e.g. a network location such as for example a website an ftp site etc. .

In an example step a determination whether the particular URI corresponds to at least one of the one or more URI items may be made. In this regard the particular URI to which access may have been requested in the example step may be compared with one or more URI items in the URI whitelist to determine whether the particular URI corresponds to at least one of the one or more URI items. If the particular URI corresponds to at least one of the one or more URI items the example steps continue at the example step . If the particular URI does not correspond to any one of the one or more URI items the example steps continue at the example step .

In an example step the request to access the particular URI may be granted. For example the application may be allowed to access the particular URI e.g. a particular website internet host ftp host etc. .

In an example step the request to access the particular URI may be denied. For example the application may not be allowed to access the particular URI. In an example embodiment of the disclosure a notification may be presented to a user of the electronic device to inform the user that the application requested to access the particular URI and that the access to the particular URI was denied. The notification may comprise information relating to a reason why the application was denied access to the particular URI. The notification may comprise an option for the user to request from the electronic device to bypass application permission e.g. as defined by the resource manifest and or the URI whitelist associated with the applications and allow access to the particular URI e.g. even if the particular URI may not correspond to any one of the URI items associated with the URI whitelist . The present disclosure is not limited to the steps in the example method .
