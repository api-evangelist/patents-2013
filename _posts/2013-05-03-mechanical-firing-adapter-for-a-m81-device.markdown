title: Mechanical firing adapter for a M81 device
abstract: A mechanical firing adapter for an igniter, such as an M81, to enable remotely firing the igniter using a robot, such as a MTRS. MTRS are used in the disposal/disruption of IEDs. Igniters are generally used with a shock tube, a type of fuse that is used with explosive charges, like shape charges. The adapter has a base plate with a first area to secure the igniter, a second area to withdraw the igniter's pull-rod by the attached pull-ring, and a compound assembly that interfaces with a robot. The pull-ring is attached to a sled that moves rearward when a clinching force is applied to opposing paddles, which causes the connected angled articulating struts to spread open. The paddles are moved closer by a remote controlled robotic jaw, and this closing movement causes the sled to move rearward, pulling out the pull-rod, which sets off the explosive.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

The invention relates generally to explosive tools and more particularly to a means of remotely initiating an M81 shock tube igniter.

An M81 igniter is used to ignite a time blasting fuse or to initiate a shock tube. Shock tube is a thin plastic tube with a thin layer of special explosive material deposited on its interior surface. The standard M81 igniter has the following visible components a small plastic tube with a pull ring on a pull rod projecting from one end a safety cotter pin that passes through the tube and a screw cap that secures a holding mechanism for the fuse or shock tube. The igniter can accommodate a shock tube or a time blasting fuse. A two piece plastic plug allows proper securing of the shock tube with just inner piece removed or the time blasting fuse with both pieces removed . A partially cut away prior art view of an M81 is shown in .

The M81 was engineered to be manually actuated by the operator. The ignition sequence is typically as follows An operator explosive expert while positioning an explosive charge at the desired distance from the target begins dispenses shock tube time blasting fuse from the dispenser. After the explosive charge has been positioned the operator moves away continuing to dispense the shock tube time blasting fuse until a sufficient pay out length has been deployed to reach a safe area for personnel. The shock tube is then connected to the igniter. To make this connection the operator loosens the screw cap and removes some or all of the inner piece of the two piece plastic plug cuts off an end of the tube fuse and inserts it in the hole from which the plug was removed. The screw cap is then re tightened to secure the fuse or shock tube. The safety cotter pin can then be removed. To initiate the M81 while holding the body of the M81 the operator uses his other hand to pull on the pull ring which in turn pulls out the pull rod. The pull rod pulls the firing pin against the force of a spring. When the limit of travel is reached the pull rod releases the firing pin which is forced by the spring into the primer which fires with a flame and an explosive shock which ignites the fuse or initiates the shock tube therein detonating the explosive charge.

In more recent developments the shock tube can be manually initiated using an electrical spark produced by a sparking device attached to a robotic device. In both cases M81 and sparking device manual ignition is required. An example of the robotic device is the MTRS platform Man Transportable Robotic System . Initiating shock tube by hand requires the robot operator to maneuver the robot from the target site dispense a sufficient pay out length until enough has been deployed for the operator to move away while continuing the dispensing shock tube to a safe area. This method of operation is time consuming and prevents additional investigation once the shock tube deployment begins. Another method of initiating shock tube is by an electrical spark produced by a firing device attached to the MTRS robotic platform. This method requires tethering the robot to the shock tube. The tethering prevents free movement of the robot and is problematic. For instance if a robot runs over the shock tube the shock tube can become tangled in the drive tracks of the robot limiting the robot s movement.

The disclosed invention in one aspect is a mechanical firing adapter for an igniter such as M81 and M60 where the firing adapter enables the igniter to be actuated by an MTRS Man Transportable Robotic Systems where the MTRS is generally remotely controlled.

An igniter with the disclosed mechanical firing adapter enables a robotic arm to effect movement that simulates manual activation of legacy igniters. The robot can and usually is remotely controlled. Taken together the invention therein is also a method to activate remotely an igniter fitted with the invented adapter. In another aspect the invention uses a Man Transportable Robotic System MTRS platforms which are relatively less expensive systems. The mechanical firing adapter enables the remote controlled robot to not only deploy an explosive charge to an incident site where the incident site is where the charge is detonated but the igniter and shock tube can also be deployed by using the MTRS. The operator is positioned at a safe distance and the robot can maneuver freely until the explosive has been set up and conditions are ready to fire the explosive charge. The robot s distance to a safe location is significantly closer to the incident site than what is consider acceptably safe for personnel.

The mechanical firing adapter in another aspect includes a base plate with a first area with a frame for fastening the igniter to a front side of the base plate a second area for withdrawing the pull rod axially from the igniter where upon being withdrawn to a limit of travel the igniter is activated. The second area generally includes a plurality of elongate slots where each elongate slot has a length that is at least as long as the limit of travel. A compound assembly completes the interface between the robot and the igniter. Robots typically have an arm with a clamping jaw with a closing action for picking up items. When the jaw is closed the compound assembly converts the closing action into a substantially linear movement that is orthogonal to the closing action. The linear movement causes a controlled withdrawal of the pull rod from the igniter.

The compound assembly includes a sled element that can linearly move across the base plate tracking along a medial line. The sled element has a medial hitch onto which the pull ring can be attached and the elongate slots serve as a tracking mechanism for the sled element to connect to the base plate. The compound assembly includes a pair of opposing paddles conformed to be simultaneously held and brought towards each other when the robotic jaw closes. Each of the pair of opposing paddles is attached to at least two articulating struts at least one to the front and at least one to the rear such that the front and rear struts are angled with respect to each and when the angle between struts is small the distance between opposing paddles is much larger than when the angle is larger. As will be shown a relatively small decrease in the distance between opposing paddles produces a significant opening of the angle and spreading of the front and rear struts.

The movement of the struts is possible because each strut is pivotal on both ends and at least one front articulating strut is pivotally attached to a front pivotal pin on the paddle and the strut extends forward to a front pin on the first area of the base plate. At least one rear articulating strut is pivotally attached to a rear pin on the paddle and the rear strut extends rearward to a sled pin.

When a clinching force is applied by the robotic jaw such as by a pair of opposing surfaces on hydraulic pistons or motorized geared jaws the pair of opposing paddles move toward each other causing the articulating elements to spread therein forcing the sled element which as previously described is connected to the rear struts with rear pivotal pins to move toward the rear. The pull ring is jointly attached to the sled s medial hitch and the pull rod movement of the sled to the rear withdraws the pull rod quickly reaching the limit of travel. Accordingly the pull rod releases the firing pin which is forced by the spring into the primer. The primer fires with a flame and an explosive shock that will ignite an attached fuse or an attached shock tube.

In another aspect the invention is a method to activate remotely an igniter mounted on the invented adapter. The method may include using the MTRS to place an explosive charge and dispense the shock tube from a dispenser setting down the dispenser down and using the MTRS to perform other functions paying out additional shock tube if required and using the MTRS to robotically initiate the shock tube.

Among other advantages the mechanical firing adapter for an M81 device provides a means of mechanically initiating an M81 shock tube igniter remotely with the Man Transportable Robotic System MTRS platforms. This configuration allows an operator to deploy a robot to an incident site and both the operator and robot may maneuver freely until it is time to fire the explosive charge. The robot may be moved to a safe location where the robot may use the adapter to initiate mechanically the shock tube initiation system.

The mechanical firing adapter provides the compatibility of using a robotic arm to utilize legacy igniters such as a M81 where generally the igniter is in communication with an explosive charge via a shock tube that is connected on one end to the igniter and on a distal end of the shock tube is connected to the explosive charge. The legacy igniter is defined herein to mean that it was originally engineered for manual activation. The compatibility eliminates the need for manual activation of the igniter and this feature enables the use of a shorter length of shock tube with less exposure of personnel to a potentially dangerous target area incident site. The invented mechanical firing adapter provides a mechanism for using remotely controlled robots to conduct effectively a nominally manual operation robotically. The net effect is the continued use of the igniter like the M81 thus extending the useful life of a stock piled standard item preventing its obsolescence and providing Man Transportable Robotic System MTRS platforms with a new tool for other possible applications. The invention is also a method to activate remotely an igniter fitted with the invented adapter and in so doing reduce the chance of a robot s tracks and other components to be snarled by the shock tube.

As shown in the legacy igniter has a body with a primer end with a firing pin a primer a spring and an opposing end having a pull rod with an attached safety cotter pin a pull ring and a limit of travel as shown in .

Referring to the firing adapter includes a base plate having a front edge a front side a back side See a perimeter edge and a rear edge . The legacy igniter is not an element of the invention and as such it is shown with dashed lines. The illustrated base plate is substantially rectangular but other shapes are anticipated. For instance a round base plate would provide improved lateral stability. The base plate could also have legs and more than one layer.

The mechanical firing adapter has a first area . Included in the first area is a frame functionally dimensioned to secure the igniter on the front side of the base plate . The front side of the base plate has eyelets through which a cable strap is cinched around the igniter s body further securing the igniter in the frame . A second area of the plate is used to withdraw the pull rod axially from the igniter s body where upon being retracted a distance that is the limit of travel as shown in the igniter is activated. The second area includes a plurality of elongate slots which are apertures extending through the base plate where each elongate slot has a length that is at least as long as the distance of the limit of travel. The illustrated slots include a medial first slot where the medial first slot extends lengthwise aligned coplanar with the pull rod. Additionally there is a lateral second slot and a lateral third slot . The lateral slots are substantially parallel to the medial slot . The medial slot substantially bisects the lateral slots . Cumulatively the elongate slots serve as a tracking mechanism for the sled element to connect to the base plate.

The firing adapter has a compound assembly that when clinched converts a closing action into a linear movement that is a substantially orthogonal to the closing action. The linear movement produces a controlled withdrawal of the pull rod from the igniter. The compound assembly includes a sled element that may be linearly moved across the base plate tracking along the medial first slot . The sled element has a medial hitch onto which the pull ring can be attached. There are a pair of opposing paddles conformed to be held and clinched by a single robotic jaw not show where a first paddle is attached to at least two articulating first struts . Each first strut is pivotal on both ends and at least one front articulating first strut is pivotally attached to a first front pin of the first paddle and extends to the first area of the base plate where it is pivotally attached to a first block pin . The first block pin projects substantially perpendicular from the base plate and is located proximate to a primer end see of the frame . At least one rear articulating first strut is pivotally attached to a rear pin of the first paddle and extends to the second area of the base plate where it is pivotally attached to a first sled pin . The first sled pin projects substantially perpendicular from the sled and is located approximately lateral to the medial hitch and substantially over the lateral second slot . A second paddle that is substantially a mirror of the first paddle is attached to at least two articulating second struts . Each second strut is pivotal on both ends where at least one front articulating second strut is pivotally attached to a front pin of the second paddle and extends to the first area of the base plate where it is pivotally attached to an opposing first block pin . The opposing first block pin projects substantially perpendicular from the base plate and it is located proximate to the other side of the primer end of the frame . There is at least one rear articulating second strut pivotally attached to a rear pin of the second paddle . The strut extends to the second area of the base plate where it is pivotally attached to a second sled pin . The second sled pin projects substantially perpendicular from the sled and it is located on the opposing side of the sled element approximately lateral to the medial hitch and substantially over the lateral third slot .

When a clinching force is applied by the jaw on the robotic arm the pair of opposing paddles and move toward each other causing the articulating elements to spread therein forcing the sled element to move away from the first area of the base plate toward the rear edge .

The pull ring which is jointly attached to the sled s medial hitch and the pull rod withdraws the pull rod quickly reaching the limit of travel as shown in . On reaching the limit of travel the pull rod releases the firing pin see which is forced by the spring into the primer which fires with a flame and an explosive shock that will ignite an attached fuse or an attached shock tube.

Referring to which is an elevational perspective view of the exemplary embodiment shown in wherein the paddles have been partially moved together causing the rearward movement of the sled. In each of the paddles are initially about 0.875 inches P as measured from an inner bottom edge of a paddle to a lateral edge of the base plate. In each of the paddles are closer about 0.5 inches P as measured from an inner bottom edge of a paddle to a lateral edge of the base plate. The net movement of each paddle is about 0.375 inches closer to the lateral edge. In the sled element as measured from a rear edge of the sled element to a rear edge of the base plate was initially about 1.685 inches S and in the distance to the rear edge is about 0.875 inches S . The net change for each paddle is the absolute value P P or 0.875 0.50 which is about 0.375 inches. The net change for the sled element is the absolute value S S or 1.685 0.875 which is about 0.81 inches. So the sled element moves about twice as far as a paddle. This configuration is shown in . The limit of travel is of course sign sensitive as the pull rod has to be withdrawn a finite distance or else the firing pin will not be released hence the use of the absolute brackets. As is evident from there is still at least another 0.875 inches left in reserve. If more travel is desired the invented adapter may be scaled up and the struts may be made even longer. The adapter is dimensioned according to the requirements of the task.

The medial slot essentially bisects the lateral slots .

The mechanical firing adapter has a compound assembly that when force is applied as shown in the direction indicated by the large black arrows labeled F the force produces a closing action. This closing action is converted into a substantially orthogonal linear movement. The linear movement produces a controlled withdrawal of the pull rod from the igniter s body.

The invention further includes a method of igniting an explosive charge. The method may include the steps of providing an explosive charge a length of shock tube spooled on a dispenser an igniter such as M81 having a body with a primer end for attaching the shock tube and an opposing end having a pull rod with an attached pull ring and a safety cotter pin and a mechanical firing adapter to which can be fastened the igniter. The mechanical firing adapter has a base plate with a first area for securing the igniter a second area including a sled element with a hitch to which the pull ring can be fastened and a compound assembly of opposing paddles connected to articulating struts. The struts convert a jaw like closing motion of the paddles by a robotic arm into a translational linear movement of the sled element therein withdrawing the pull rod. The method further includes attaching the shock tube to the igniter and confirming the paddles are in the fully open position. The sled element is proximate to the first area. The method further includes attaching the igniter to the mechanical firing adapter confirming by an inspection by a robot that an explosive charge may be moved close enough to the target to be effective where during the inspection the shock tube may be dispensed setting up the explosive charge and connecting the shock tube to the explosive charge. The method further includes dispensing additional shock tube as needed positioning the mechanical firing adapter such that the paddles are accessible and confirming that there is no clinching force on the paddles confirming that a safety area is still clear removing the safety pin providing an additional safe region for any personnel and closing the paddles utilizing a remote controlled robotic jaw therein detonating the explosive charge.

Finally any numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations for example by using the term about that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding.
