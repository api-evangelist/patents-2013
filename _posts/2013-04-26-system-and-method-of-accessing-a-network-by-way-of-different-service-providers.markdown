Concurrently submitted herewith is Appendix A having file name APP A.TXT totaling 78 kilobytes and created on Jun. 20 2001 consisting of a computer listing constitutes a part of the specification of this invention pursuant to 37 C.F.R. Sections 1.77 and 1.96 the appendix being incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.

A portion of the disclosure of this appendix document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records but otherwise reserves all copyrights whatsoever.

The present invention relates in general to digital data networks and more particularly to network access and to minimizing unauthorized interception of data and denial of network services.

There are many networks of computers throughout the world and there is a need for the computers to communicate with each other across the network. To provide order and security many networks require a computer wishing access to be authenticated before that computer is granted access. After establishing that the computer should be allowed to communicate over the network it may be given an identification number so that the computer may be contacted by other computers on the network in accordance with network protocol. In general this process applies to a system designated as the Internet.

The Internet comprises a network of computers that interconnect many of the world s businesses institutions and individuals. The Internet which means interconnected network of networks links tens of thousands of smaller computer networks.

The Internet can be accessed directly through telephone lines with a device called a modem or indirectly though a local area network LAN . Most users do not have the expertise to connect their computers and associated equipment to the Internet and or finances to have a continuous connection to the Internet. Thus most users access the Internet through an Internet Service Provider ISP . The ISP can distribute the costs of necessary equipment and telephone lines to many users on some time multiplexed basis. While an ISP may have access to only one server and a few modems for receiving incoming calls from users some ISPs have access to hundreds and even thousands of modems and many servers to interface between users and one or more high speed telephone lines of at least DS1 standard communication capacity.

Usually the ISPs that charge the lowest prices to the user are the busiest and users often find that access to a low cost ISP is blocked by a busy signal . On the other hand a user of the high priced ISPs seldom encounters busy signals. The high priced ISPs have fewer customers can afford to add modems as needed and are not confronted with suddenly increased demands on equipment capacity.

Some ISPs use less expensive ie slower rate poorer quality or lower capacity telephone lines or equipment to provide low cost and as a result the data transmission rate of communications between the user and the Internet may be substantially less than the capability of the users modem. Many sets of information on the Internet such as Web pages include pictures pointers to other pages music etc that require large amounts of data to be transmitted for ultimate display. When a user is attempting to access material requiring the transmission of large volumes of data a low data transmission rate equates to a long time spent waiting to obtain that data.

When a user first installs software in a computer to be used in connecting the computer to a given ISP many items of information need to be provided to the software before the user can communicate with the ISP and be connected to the Internet. While some of the information such as the specific communication port to be used ie com1 or com2 and the modem type used in the computer would be universal and would be identical regardless of the ISP used other information is ISP specific. ISP specific type information would include the ISP dial in number a Password Authentication Protocol PAP identification number and a PAP password for that ISP.

Different ISPs provide different services to users. Some ISPs no or low service may offer only a connection to the Internet without technical help to a user connected to that ISP and further without any additional features. Other ISPs full service may offer many features such as encyclopedia type information interactive games access to otherwise costly databases etc.

A user in a commercial environment may operate a computer that is connected to a LAN and also is connected to a modem. There are often business considerations that require some communications with the Internet be accomplished through the LAN and other especially personal communications be accomplished through a modem. If a single software entity such as a browser is used for both types of Internet connection several items of information need to be altered with the accompanying chance for error and frustration of the user.

When a computer is subjected to stress such as by a large and sudden variation in supply voltage ie an electrical spike there may be corruption of data in the software and or data banks of the computer. When such corruption concerns the data needed to communicate with the Internet a considerable amount of time is often required to ascertain the cause of the failure to attain communication and further time is required to correct the problem.

Some Internet users are highly mobile and may need to access the Internet from various locations some of which locations do not have a local phone number for communicating with the normally used ISP. Such a user either must pay the cost of a long distance call or access a different ISP after modifying the appropriate data the operating system s networking dial up networking or communications properties used to accomplish such access. Such modification always invites a chance for erroneous data entry in the process and the accompanying time required to rectify the situation.

Another problem related to network use is related to electronic mail which terminology is popularly shortened to email. Email is used to quickly communicate with other users of connected network terminals. The process is normally accomplished by sending a set of data including a header portion a message body and sometimes one or more file attachments. Typically the header contains the name of the recipient in a TO line the sender in a FROM line and a subject in a SUBJECT line. Even if the message body and the attachments are scrambled or otherwise encrypted a persistent entity monitoring the email being sent to and from a given terminal may glean considerable information from the subject matter listed and from the number of messages sent between same parties. This information is typically sent in clear text unencoded to facilitate the delivery of email to the proper temporary storage facility normally a post office box like repository of the service provider of the recipient until such time as the recipient retrieves the email from the service provider. The recipient also uses the header information in determining priority of messages to be read.

A further problem is third party mail relay. This is a process whereby junk emailers use a service system other than their own to send massive amounts of mail without paying for the service. The massive amount of mail can so overload the system that an invaded system can crash overload or otherwise be damaged. This overload is termed in the art as a denial of service attack. The overall process of sending massive amount of junk email is termed spamming . The third party mail relay process is also used to bypass other systems filters which are set up to block mail from the junk emailers system.

In view of the above there exists a need to quickly and easily access the Internet from various locations being able to access ISPs providing different types of services using various adaptors ie modem or LAN card and being able to choose whether preference should be given to items such as cost and quality of service without the user having to be concerned about correctly modifying associated data and parameters such as phone numbers IDs passwords etc used by the Internet software.

There is a further need to be able to send email to others in a manner which minimizes the possibility that unauthorized entities may be able to retrieve significant data from email header information.

Also there is a need to prevent junk emailers or other unauthorized parties from using the third party mail relay process in connection with a network service system.

It should be noted that the present invention applies to any network or interconnected set of networks. However since the Internet is a well known example of an interconnected set of networks Internet terminology and interaction examples will be used in the explanation of this invention.

1 Eliminates the need for a computer user to configure and reconfigure computer networking software for network access through a multiplicity of ISPs and Network Access Providers NAP companies which own the telephone networks and modem banks such as AT T GTE UUNet PSI etc. .

2 Allows a Network Re seller such as an Internet Service Provider to offer network access via a multiplicity of Network Access Providers based on cost location availability reliability etc.

3 Allows a Network Re seller to balance network loads through a multiplicity of Network Access Providers and across a multiplicity of network computer servers.

4 Eliminates the need for a computer user to know or configure network access telephone numbers or network access protocol identification numbers.

5 Eliminates the need for a computer user or mobile computer user to re configure remote network access software to connect to a network from a remote location.

6 Allows multiple users to use a single computer each with their own unique networking attributes and unique network identity.

7 Allows separate and distinct identifications ID and passwords for different services and network functions such as PAP IDs and PAP password Email ID and password etc.

8 Provides a user with true network anonymity by assigning independent non user specific identifications and passwords for such things as PAP authentication FTP and Email logins News Server logins and network server logins.

9 Provides Email anonymity by transmitting and receiving all email through a third party broker wherein if appropriate aliases may be used for all un encrypted data and these aliases may be changed periodically by the system in a manner transparent to the user.

10 Eliminates third party email relay SPAMMING by transparently authenticating each user system prior to giving access to a sendmail server.

This invention relates to network connections such as the Internet and allows system to be independently transparently and dynamically connected or reconnected to a network based upon any number of attributes such as user or group identity cost availability reliability etc. Further this invention supports many types of physical connections such as telephone dial up connections ISDN connections Ethernet and other local area networking connections. It should be noted that while Internet terms such as ISP are used throughout this description the invention is operable with any network or portion of any network and thus terms such as NSP Network Service Provider have been coined for use in the claims to identify similar or analogous systems and devices.

A traditional network connection requires someone skilled in the art of computer networking to setup and configure both network related hardware such as modems or Local Area Network cards Ethernet Token ring or other cards and network software. The invention eliminates the need for such network configuration skills.

The invention configures and reconfigures network related software to support multiple users with multiple network protocols and or multiple networks using the same protocol without the need of any computer network configuration skills and further allows the configuration to be changed or modified dynamically without any user intervention.

The principles of the present invention and their advantages are best understood by referring to the illustrated embodiment depicted in of the drawings in which like numbers designate like parts.

The invention includes software which is sometimes referred to as middle ware because it resides between an electronic device operating system and the end users interface. The inventive software has all the attributes of middle ware as it configures and manages network communication equipment such as modems and Ethernet cards network protocols such as the Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP and the associated interfaces between the communication equipment network protocol and the computer s operating system for each individual user or groups of users.

Now referring to there is illustrated a plurality of Internet service providers ISP through ISPx connected to a network sometimes referred to as the Internet . As will be appreciated an Internet service provider ISP provides access for one or more uses to the Internet through a physical interface. The term internet service provider includes network access providers NAPs and Network Service Providers NSPs as well. In general terms a user connects to the ISP via a communications link and the ISP provides connection to the Internet . As will be appreciated by many users of the Internet the ISP typically has many modems accessible from a limited number of telephone numbers. Each of these modems has an assigned internet protocol IP address and normally an assigned DNS name. Such assigned names and IP addresses will look something like 1cust239.tnt.orll.da.uu.net and 208.250.77.239 respectively. When a user contacts the ISP the user is connected to the next available modem and the IP address of that modem becomes the IP address of that user for the remainder of that connection session. The user may include a single computer group of computers local area network or a larger network connected to the ISP via a communications link. However in most applications the user will include a single user requesting access time to the Internet .

To begin the process of the present invention the user installs downloads a client dispatch application program see that furnishes the user with one or more ISP access telephone numbers one or more valid test and Registration Password Authentication Protocol PAP identification ID numbers and a valid PAP password associated with a predetermined one of the ISPs . The client dispatch application will be described in more detail further below. The access information allows the user to authenticate the user s right to connect to the Internet via the predetermined ISP . The access information mentioned comprises the previously mentioned access telephone number the PAP ID the PAP password and additional ISP specific information required by the user to gain access to the Internet via the predetermined ISP collectively ISP specific configuration information is initially provided by the client dispatch application . In addition the client dispatch application provides basic configuration and initialization information installation and configuration to the user s computer to configure and manage the network communication equipment network protocols and the associated interfaces needed to develop the capability to access the Internet regardless of the particular ISP.

After the client dispatch application is installed and the initial ISP specific information is known the client dispatch application causes the user to automatically transmit access information to the predetermined ISP ISPor ISPX . The line of communication through which the access information is transmitted to the predetermined ISP by the user USERor USERX is identified by the reference numerals depending on the particular user USERor USERX and the particular ISP ISP or ISPX . Upon receipt of the access information the ISP authenticates the user . The ISP checks to see whether the PAP ID and PAP password received from the user is valid. It will be understood that the authentication process performed by the ISP utilizes one or more appropriate methods such as Remote Authentication Dial in User Service RADIUS which are normally associated with an authentication server a database at the ISP Network Service Provider NSP or the NAP. If the PAP ID and or PAP password are not valid the ISP will disconnect the user or notify the user that the PAP ID and or PAP password is invalid. If valid the user and the ISP create a point to point protocol PPP i.e. communications connection which is identified in by reference numerals depending on the particular user USERor USERX and the particular ISP ISPor ISPX . The PPP allows the ISP to transmit receive information to from the user . As a result the user is given access to the Internet and the ISP generates an internet protocol IP address to uniquely identify the user on the Internet . The particular IP address assigned to the us depends on the IP addresses that are available and assigned to the particular ISP to which the user is connected. An IP address is presently 32 bits and is normally represented with four decimal numbers each ranging from 0 to 255 e.g. 128.54.28.200 where each decimal number represents one byte of the 32 bits.

In accordance with the present invention an Internet service provider access service or ASP Access Service Provider is connected to the Internet . The external location or physical address of the access service is defined by a predetermined and unique address i.e. IP address . After the user gains access to the Internet via one of the ISPs the client dispatch application resident in the user s computer transmits a data message to the access service through the Internet using the predetermined address of the access service . This data message is sent via a path identified as TCP IP or TCP IP depending on the particular ISP to which the user is connected for access to the Internet . The communications link protocol used for Internet communications is defined as Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP and is well known in the art. As will be appreciated other network communications protocols and standards may be used during the present or in the future by the present System invention due to the flexibility provided in the use of multiple databases to store various types of data.

The data message transmitted from the user and received by the access service contains information about the user including the user s identification and address current PAP ID time stamp information and version information of the client dispatch application operating on the user s computer etc. In response to the user information received the access service transmits an access information data message that includes access information for a particular ISP . The access information is specific to a dial in telephone number of a particular ISP and upon receipt by the user allows the user to gain access to the Internet via that particular ISP . The ISP specific access information includes an ISP phone number for dial in to the ISP a PAP ID for the ISP and a PAP password for the ISP and may also include default routing information i.e. gateway address information default directory information including domain name server information sub protocols for the PPP for the ISP and configuration information for the hardware i.e. modem of the ISP to configure the user s modem such as data compression information and speed. The ISP specific information may also include service option defaults such as Email IDs POP protocols and browser information. The PAP ID may or may not be sent depending on the current PAP ID information transmitted from the user to the access service in the data message e.g. if the current PAP ID and the new PAP ID are the same a new PAP ID does not need to be sent .

After receiving the ISP specific access information the client dispatch application may disconnect the user from the current ISP and automatically dial and reconnect the user to the desired ISP associated with the ISP specific access information. As will be appreciated the desired ISP may be another ISP or may be the same ISP to which the user was previously connected depending on the attributes of the particular ISP desired to be used for access to the Internet . If the ISP phone number for dial in to the ISP and a PAP ID received with the new access information refer to the same ISP the client dispatch application will not disconnect the user and the user s session will continue uninterrupted.

The access information data message includes the information necessary PAP ID PAP password and other information if needed to access a desired ISP and may include information for a plurality of desired ISPs or multiple PAP IDs and PAP passwords for a desired single ISP. It will be understood that more than one access information data message packet may be utilized and transmitted each packet containing a portion of the information packet or each may contain access information for a specific ISP .

The access service offers Internet access to the user via a plurality of ISPs based on cost location availability reliability etc. Based on the geographic location of the user the access service identifies to the user one or more ISPs that provide local access availability via local telephone numbers or toll free numbers and provide the user with information needed to access one of the identified ISPs using the ISP specific access information . For desired low cost operation the access service identifies the ISP that provides the lowest cost access service through which the user may access the Internet from the identified ISP at the user s location. For the reliability operation the access service identifies one or more ISPs that provide the highest reliability of connecting through which the user may access the Internet from the identified ISPs at the user s location. For the availability operation the access service periodically receives availability information from each of the plurality of ISPs . In response to this information the access service identifies one or more ISPs that provide the highest availability through which the user may access the Internet from the identified ISPs .

As will be appreciated the location operation reliability operation and availability operation may each provide to the user the identity of multiple ISPs or multiple dial in numbers for a particular ISP whereby the user will attempt connection in order of priority. For example the user may attempt access to a first ISP contained in a list of multiple ISPs that have been identified based on availability or reliability. If a connection is not successful with the first ISP the user will next try a second ISP in the list and so on until a connection made. In another mode of operation example the user may attempt access to a first ISP utilizing a first dial in number contained in a list of multiple dial in numbers for the first ISP that have been identified based on availability or reliability. If a connection is not successful with the first dial in number the user will next try a second dial in number in the list and so on until a connection is made. Further a combination of multiple ISPs and multiple dial in numbers may be used.

Now referring to there is illustrated a block diagram of the access service connected to the Internet and a block diagram of the user connected to the Internet via the ISP . The user may be a computer system that includes the client dispatch application and the computer s operating system as well as a registry or initialization file s a physical adaptor file s and a protocol file s . The files are operating system files system configuration files that provide the user with system configuration information for supplying the basic capabilities needed to successfully connect the user to a network such as the Internet . The client dispatch application correctly configures and sets the system configuration files with the necessary system configuration information including network protocols adapter information IP addresses domain name system DNS server addresses gateway addresses other operating system binding functions dynamic host control protocol options and any other system options. As will be appreciated the system configuration information necessary for the user to access the Internet is well known in the art.

The user also includes several databases for storing information including a phone database a network services database a button bar database and a user database . As will be appreciated the databases may be combined into a single database may be separate and or may be relational. Generally the client dispatch application includes the databases or generates the databases and stores pre loaded information into the databases upon installation of the client dispatch application on the user computer.

The phone database includes one or more dial up telephone numbers for the access location s of each of the ISPs . Each dial up number entry includes associated information including on off field data state or a toll free number city dial up telephone number type of modems supported analog or digital whether the number is available for registration identity of the ISP that owns the dial in number ID for provider sequence number order for putting number in a specific area . Some of the foregoing data is access information. An example of some of the contents of the phone database and its data entries is set forth in Appendix A which is hereby incorporated by reference.

The network services database includes access information for each dial in number contained within the phone database . Each of the stored dial in numbers is associated with an ISP . The access information for each dial in number for a particular ISP includes one or more PAP IDs one or more PAP passwords default routing information i.e. gateway address information default directory information including domain name server information sub protocols for the PPP and configuration information for the hardware i.e. modem of the ISP to configure the user s modem such as data compression information and speed. The network services database may also include service option defaults such as Email IDs and the POP protocols and browser information associated with the dial in number. The network services database also includes the basic configuration and initialization information necessary to configure and manage the network communications equipment network protocols and associated interfaces for the user for basic communications between the user and the Internet . In addition the network services database includes information relating to the type of service type of account requested by the user such as the lowest cost service the highest reliability service the most reliable service or combinations thereof plan pricing and descriptions and includes information identifying one or more primary processes to be performed by the client dispatch application . As will be appreciated some of the information in the network services database and the phone database may overlap. An example of the network services database and its data entries is set forth in Appendix A which is hereby incorporated by reference.

The button bar database includes information related to button bar creation and modification. All functions may be initiated through the human interface a Toolbar also described in the art as a button bar and basic examples of which may be found in many present day computer applications . The Toolbar of the present invention has some unique properties as it can be dynamically changed or updated via a Pinger process or a MOT script. As defined in this application and as will be described in more detail later a Pinger process comprises an entity that acts transparently as a services coordinator to provide and or administer the following 

2. Authentication services that securely authenticate client access to email commerce and other public and private network servers and services.

3. Update services that can perform client software database and maintenance services during periods of inactivity.

The Pinger entity as suggested above has as one of its functions the responsibility of providing database updates to the client user. When a MOT script is used it can be part of an E mail message an HTTP web document download and so forth which transparently automates the Toolbar update. The Toolbar can be integrated with ticker tape which can spawn MOT scripts URLs or execute programs. Each Toolbar button may be programmed with a function in the button bar database . The Toolbar reads a plurality for this example five of attributes from the button bar database 

3. Execution Type This attribute supports the following types and further determines if the fifth attribute read by the toolbar would be Execute File 5a or URL 5b 

When a user clicks on one of the Toolbar functions or the Ticker tape the appropriate procedure is started. For example if a button is programmed to go to the USA Today button Caption web site the Execution type would be set to DDE to a URL and the URL would be set to something similar to http www.usatoday.com and the Hint would be set to something similar to Open to XXXXXXXXX Web site for the latest news .

As will be appreciated a MOT script defines how to build a button bar using the button bar database and its database entries. The MOT script is typically associated with a Web page and when the user clicks on the Web page the MOT script associated with the Web page is read back by the client dispatch application . The client dispatch application uses the particular MOT script and the button bar database information and builds the button bar automatically according to the MOT script specifications. An example of the button bar database and its data entries is set forth in Appendix A which is hereby incorporated by reference.

The user database includes information related to the user such as name address phone numbers billing information Email ID and Email password type of account and unique PAP ID and PAP password if applicable. It will be understood that the user database may be merged into the network services database . An example of the user database and its data entries is set forth in Appendix A which is hereby incorporated by reference.

The access service is connected to the Internet and is defined by a predetermined and unique address i.e. IP address . The access service includes one or more network servers databases . It will be understood that access service includes a computer system having one or more processors memory and support hardware all not shown in this figure for processing and storing information and data communications. The network databases store information relating to the user s including the same information that is or would normally be in the user database and also includes session keys transaction keys billing data connection history data ISP specific access information and information about what procedures a user has performed and the like. Specific functions of the access service have been described in the foregoing and will be described in more detail below. The Pinger entity may be a part of the access service provider or it may be separate. For the present discussion it will be assumed to be part of the access service provider .

After the user connects to the Internet via a predetermined ISP the client dispatch application dispatches an initial pinger message to the access service via the Internet . Included within the pinger message is header information that includes the current user ID account owner ID PAP ID the current IP address assigned to the user Group ID the users system s current time database revisions levels client dispatch application and other related software revision levels.

All communications between the client dispatch application and the access service take place through a process identified as the Pinger. The Pinger provides secure and unsecure periodic bidirectional communication between the user and the access service . The functions of the Pinger are as follows 

Read Write or Update any entry in any of the databases of the user and any of the databases of the access service and further initiate a secondary transmission when appropriate.

With these functions the client dispatch application can request database updates or save files for execution later and the access service can initiate events database updates or save files for execution later. The Pinger process also provides a heartbeat mechanism to prevent the premature disconnection of the user from the network by an ISP . That is many ISPs have a modem inactivity timeout interval that disconnects users after some short interval of time if there has been no network activity during that interval of time. The heartbeat function is programmable and in the preferred embodiment is set at five minutes during the user s first three hours of connection time and increases by five minutes each half hour thereafter. In the heartbeat function the client dispatch application transmits the user s ID to the access service .

The pinger is initiated by the client dispatch application upon connection to the network . The client dispatch application transmits header information to the access server using the IP address of the access server . The header information includes the current user ID account owner ID PAP ID the current IP address assigned to the user Group ID the users system s current time database revisions levels and client dispatch application and other related software revision levels. With this information the access server determines whether a user is making two connections while only paying for one and thus needs to be disconnected or is a user that needs a database or file update. The Continue Transaction function provides a mechanism to partially transmit data and commands over multiple sessions successive connections by the user to the network without having to restart the transaction from the beginning.

While the pinger process transparent to the user allows the client dispatch application and the access service to interact and download database updates or other information to the user there is an alternative way to provide the updates to the databases etc. at the request of the user . The access service may provide a Web page whereby when the user clicks on the Web page a MOT script and other data associated with the Web page is transmitted from the Web page site to the client dispatch application . This gives the user the capability to request a data update or to receive other information . Alternatively a MOT script and other data can be transmitted via an email message an FTP file transfer procedure site or other similar networking storage and transport mechanism to the client dispatch application.

The Script Language used by the Pinger and elsewhere in this application for patent is designated by the term MOT see . MOT is not however an acronym for anything meaningful. The script language is an interpretive language which is stored in an encrypted file from which the interpreter reads to initiate the MOT client dispatch application. The MOT client dispatch application can read and write database db entries Operating System initialization file entries INI and Registry Files and ASCII Text files. Further the MOT client dispatch application can spawn executable programs network connection AWK scripts and other MOT scripts.

Now referring to there is illustrated the process of the client dispatch application . The flow diagrams of are representations of closed loop programming structured programming . The client dispatch application performs five primary procedures or functions as set forth in the CASE block. These include the installation registration regular use manual update and multi dial procedures. Within the multi dial procedure are several sub functions defined as the low cost reliability location availability busy sequence and single dial multi login sub functions shown and explained subsequently in connection with . The client dispatch application manages the procedures based upon data from one or more databases of the access service or other inputs received from the access service the user s databases and or the user s computer operating system files. It will be understood that databases and database information may be encrypted to prevent a user from tampering with entries contained therein.

Now referring to there is illustrated a flow diagram of an installation procedure of the client dispatch application . The procedure starts by reading information from the network services database . The network services database forms part of the software package which is loaded into a network access device such as the user computer . The network services database includes basic configuration and initialization information necessary to configure and manage the network communication equipment network protocols and the associated interfaces between the communication equipment and network protocols and the computer s operating system.

After the network services database is read the user s operating system files which in the case of a Windows operating system comprises Registry and INI files Protocol files and Physical Adapter files are examined to determine if any networking options have been installed and whether or not the files if installed are correct and configured properly as part of the No Protocol decision block. If no Protocol or Adapter has been installed the True path will be followed whereby the Installation function will configure the Adapter and necessary Protocol to successfully connect the user to a network such as the Internet . If the Protocol or Adapter that is installed is misconfigured the False path will be used whereby the Installation function will reconfigure the Adapter and necessary Protocol to successfully connect the user to a network such as the Internet . As part of the configuration process it may be noted that the correct configuration for utilization of the TCP IP Protocol would include configuring and setting the proper Operating System Registry and INI initialization files with the necessary Protocol configuration information in instances where the operating system is a version of windows. Such information includes IP addresses whether statically or dynamically assigned Domain Name System DNS name server addresses whether statically or dynamically assigned Gateway Addresses whether statically or dynamically assigned Other operating system Binding functions Dynamic Host Control Protocol options Windows Internet Naming Service WINS options whether statically or dynamically assigned and the assignment of such Protocol functions to be utilized by the appropriate Adapter. The function of configuring or reconfiguring is executed near the beginning of each of the five primary procedural tasks of the client dispatch application to ensure successful operation of a network connection even for those instances where a computer user accidentally misconfigures their system and thereby makes networking inoperable.

After the successful configuration of both the Adapter and the Protocol the procedure proceeds to the Which Adapter decision block. The appropriate adapter is utilized which is either the adapter pre programmed into the network services database if available or if there is only one Adapter then it will be used. If the Adapter is a Modem the Modem path will be followed to read from the network services database to determine if the user chooses a dial in location under the case of User Look up or if the modem shall be programmed to dial a Pre Defined dial in phone number reference in the network services database and stored in the phone database . If a database entry in the network services database is set to allow the user to choose a dial in location then the user chooses a location based on Country State or Province and City in accordance with the User Picks Dial In Location block. After the user selects the proper dial in location the installation procedure reads from the phone database to determine the dial in phone number to use. If a given location has multiple dial in phone numbers a dial in number is selected based upon attributes read from the network services database and or the phone database . Such attributes include installation dial in numbers dial in phone numbers which are only available during installation or testing . Although not pertinent to the installation procedure other attributes of phone numbers appearing in the phone database include Registration Dial in Numbers phone numbers and locations which appear to a user during registration Sequence Numbers a prioritized list of phone numbers which shall be tried in sequential order to produce the highest probability of connection Available ISP numbers phone numbers of a given ISP s modems Currently Valid Numbers phone numbers which are currently valid for use by a given users or any combination of the aforementioned.

If a value in the network services database is set for the user to use a predefined dial in number such as an 800 type toll free number the client dispatch application will read the appropriate predefined phone number entry from the phone database . After the client dispatch application has determined the proper dial in phone number whether user selected or pre defined the user s modem is initialized and dialing occurs as set forth in the Dial Connect block. If the modem is busy it will either continue to retry the same phone number or initiate a multi dial procedure as set forth in depending on the outcome of the Multi dial Mode decision block from an entry in the network database services . If the False Retry path is followed the same number is dialed until the user gives up . If a Multi Dial mode True path is followed based upon the entry in the network services database the multi dial procedure is initiated and other dial in numbers will be tried to gain access to the network. The multi dial procedure is one of the five primary procedures of the client dispatch application and is explained in more detail in connection with .

Once a connection is made the False path from the Busy decision block is followed and communication with the access service begins by sending an installation PAP ID and PAP password read from the network services database to the access service for transparent login authentication as shown by the Get Information From Server block. Once the login has occurred communication with the access service is established and transfer of data begins. The data transferred during the installation procedure may contain some basic system information about the user s computer system the type of connection being used and the location from which the connection has occurred. Once this information is received at the access service the access service sends appropriate information back to the client dispatch application . Such information may include updates to the phone database including Location addition or subtractions phone number changes and updates to the network services database including ISP additions and subtractions group user or multiple user specific configuration DNS and IP information etc. Updates to the databases which reside on the user s computer can occur transparently to the user whenever the user is connected to the Internet thereby ensuring that the user s network related information is always current and accurate. Any updates received from the access service are written to the appropriate database i.e. network services database phone database or others by the client dispatch application . The client dispatch application also updates the network services database to reflect installation complete . Thus the client dispatch application is informed that the next execution Case to start is Registration as will be shown in .

At this point the dial in location attributes Installation dial in numbers Registration Dial in Numbers Sequence Numbers Available ISP numbers Currently Valid Numbers provide control mechanisms to ensure that a user receives the appropriate level of service for which they are subscribed such as the lowest cost service the highest reliability service the most available service or combinations thereof. Further these updated and database stored attributes allow for remote testing of the network communications full connection TCP IP test to the Internet the user s system for basic configuration database integrity network load balancing and the reduction of fraud by dynamic control of phone number validity.

If the Adapter used to connect to the network is a Local Area Network device such as an Ethernet card the LAN path is followed from the Which Adapter decision block. In this situation once communication with the access service is established transfer of data and updates begin as described in the paragraphs above.

Now referring to there is illustrated a flow diagram of the registration procedure of the client dispatch application . The procedure as all primary procedures starts by reading the network services database to determine the appropriate execution Case and in this case the registration procedure . The registration procedure starts by reading the network services database to gather the necessary information such as which Adaptor and Protocol to use and proceeds to configure and initialize the appropriate networking functions to start the user registration process. A Which Adapter decision block includes the two paths of Modem and LAN . After a determination is made as to which Adapter and Protocol to use the process proceeds to the Re Configure Adapter Protocol block to configure and initialize the appropriate networking functions to start the user registration procedure i.e. configuration process for the user s computer .

The registration procedure comprises several forms pop up forms into which the user enters specific information about the user . Such information typically will include Name Address Phone Numbers Credit Card and or Banking Information Referral Information if available Personal Security information like mother s maiden name Birthdate and Preferred E mail Identity and Preferred E mail Domain Choice. The registration information for each user is stored in the network services database and or a user specific database as well as information about the user s system and revision levels of the client dispatch application and databases . Upon completion of the new user registration forms as indicated by the Update DBs with New User Information block the client dispatch application initiates communications with the access service as described earlier. The adapter used as determined by the lower most Which Adapter decision block will be the adapter determined and used during the installation process. Once communication with the access service begins the client dispatch application sends all the information that was added or updated into the network services database or user database of the user to the access service as indicated by the Send Information To Server block. The access server transmits the received information plus additional information such as one or more user assigned PAP IDs and PAP passwords Email IDs and Email Passwords back to the client dispatch application for comparison and verification of the information that was sent as indicated by the Get Information From Server block. If the information returned is not identical to the information which was sent the client dispatch application will resend the information again to the access service along the path commencing with the Notify User of Error Retry block. This process will continue until all transmitted information from the client dispatch application to the access service matches all information returned to the client dispatch application from the access service or when a maximum retry value is reached in accordance with the Quit decision block. In the preferred embodiment the maximum retry value is five. If the client dispatch application reaches a maximum retry value an error message is sent to the user notifying the user that an Error has occurred and to try reconnecting or registering again. This error message comprises a part of the True path output of the Quit decision block.

It will be understood that registration procedure may be designed to have an alternate process of prompting the user to use an alternate Adapter or Protocol and then retry where such an alternate process may be deemed appropriate.

If other users sub users are permitted to access the network under this initial user s authority such as other family members the registration process for these other users can be started during a regular use procedure described in connection with . Upon completion of a user s initial registration the user s network access display device will display an Electronic Registration Number ERN which with other personal security information can be used later to refresh a system as described below.

The registration procedure also allows users registered with the access service to temporarily use a computer or other network access device or permanently use a secondary network access device by using a refresh function which bypasses the standard registration form screens by asking the user if they have already registered. If the user has previously registered the refresh process of the registration procedure will connect communicate with the access service and download all the user information sent during the user s initial registration and the client dispatch application will update the appropriate databases on the user s network access devices storage system.

Now referring to there is illustrated a flow diagram of a regular use procedure of the client dispatch application . The regular use procedure is enabled after a user has both installed client dispatch application on a particular computer system or other network access device and registered with the access service .

The regular use procedure functions to connect a user to the network using a login and password access which is transparent to the user . This is accomplished by reading the network services database for login information such as the user PAP ID and PAP password as shown in the Read NS.db block. After reading the necessary information from the network services database and prior to the user logging onto the network the user is given an opportunity to change the user s dial in Location if the user is using a modem as an Adapter as illustrated by the Change Location decision block. If the Adapter is a modem and the user desires to change locations the user is presented with a chooses a location form that may be identical to one seen by the user during registration. The chooses a location form allows the user to select a local dial in location from pull down menu selections based on Country State or Province and City selections for a given ISP for which the user PAP ID and PAP password are valid. After the user selects the proper dial in location the phone database is read to determine what dial in phone number to use.

If a given location has multiple dial in phone numbers a dial in number is selected based upon attributes that are read from the phone database user db network services database or any combination thereof as part of the Dial Connect block. As discussed elsewhere and in particular in connection with such attributes include Installation dial in numbers dial in phone numbers which are only available during Installation or testing Registration Dial in Numbers phone numbers and locations which appear to a user during registration Sequence Numbers a prioritized list of phone numbers which shall be tried in sequential order to produce the highest probability of connection Available ISP numbers phone numbers of a given ISP s modems Currently Valid Numbers phone numbers which are currently valid for use by a given users or any combination of the aforementioned.

After the user establishes a connection to the access service a pinger function is initiated as discussed previously. The pinger function causes the client dispatch application to transmit header information to the access service as set forth in the Send Information To Server Pinger block. The header information may include a Unique Identification string for the user user ID PAP ID etc. a unique computer identification string IP address etc. time stamp information and revision information for the client dispatch application and databases as described earlier. After receipt the access service reviews the header information to determine what if any updates are required to be made to the user client s dispatch application databases or network access devices operating system. Such updates may include new dial in locations new identification information such as PAP IDs network authentication passwords such as PAP passwords other IDs other passwords change of phone numbers change of area codes low cost ISP dial in location priority sequence numbers or any combination thereof or any other information relating to gaining access to the ISP . If any updates are required these are supplied by the access service and any necessary updates will take place transparent automatic while the user is logged on to the user as part of the True process path emanating from the Transparent Update Required decision block. If such updates require user intervention such as rebooting the user s computer the user will be notified prior to the update and or prior to a reboot as part of the Notify User to Restart block. Updates which require a lot of time may span multiple log ins to the network by the user with partial updates being performed until the full completion of the update. The partial updates will take place when the users system is connected but idle and or during a pinger heartbeat function.

Now referring to there is illustrated a flow diagram of a manual update procedure of the client dispatch application . The manual update procedure provides a mechanism for a user to manually recover change modify or update the client dispatch application and the databases . This capability is useful for ISPs managing customers with billing issues as well as for servicing customers with special system configuration issues.

The manual update procedure initiates and makes a network connection using a special set of log in information defined herein as the Manual Update PAP ID and PAP password the manual update PAP ID and PAP password including the Installation Multi dial and Test PAP IDs and PAP passwords are incorporated into the user s installed client dispatch application as part of the network services database and are not easily accessible to the user . If a connection is not immediately obtained the adapter and protocol checking is completed as set forth in connection with the previous FIGURE and description thereof and as set forth in this flow diagram via the False path output of the Connected decision block. Once the connection is established either via the LAN path from the Which Adapter decision block or the False path from the Busy decision block the pinger function is initiated as indicated by the Send Pinger Information to Server block. If there already is a connection the True path is followed from the Connected decision block.

Once communication is established by the client dispatch application with the access service pinger header information any special database update request and the like etc. is transmitted from the client dispatch application generated from the network services database and or the user database to the access service as shown by the Send Update Request to Server in order to establish the identity of the user and system that is requesting an update of information from the access service . The access service uses this update request information to generate any updated information which is needed to update a specific user group of users a specific network access device such as the computer a group of computers or any combination thereof and sends any required information back to the user to update the appropriate databases or Registry or INI Adapter and or Protocol files operating system files . Upon completion of the update the client dispatch application disconnects the user from the network breaks the network connection and if appropriate the user will be notified that the network access devices operating system must be rebooted in order for the update to take effect.

Now referring to there is illustrated a flow diagram of a multi dial procedure of the client dispatch application . The multi dial procedure provides the access service with a mechanism to control access by a user a group of users a computer a group of computers a local area network LAN of computers or any combination thereof to the Internet based upon any one of the following seven sub function attributes Cost Availability Reliability Location Busy Sequence Service Selected or Single Dial Multi Login. The multi dial procedure is initiated by one of the other primary procedures see of the client dispatch application and or by a multi dial procedure tag programmed into the network services database .

When the multi dial procedure is initiated in response to a busy signal received during operation of one of the other primary procedures and the multi dial procedure tag is enabled in the network services database the multi dial procedure initiates a Busy Sequence sub function. The Busy Sequence sub function initiates one of the other multi dial procedure sub functions re dials the same dial in number before initiating one of the other multi dial procedure sub functions or dials a new dial in number identified in the next sequential area location from a list of area locations available all in response to database information based on the user s selected plan. The list of area locations available is based on the type of service plan also found in the network services database subscribed to by the user and or on PAP IDs and PAP passwords stored in the network services database . If the user has chosen to subscribe to a higher cost plan multiple PAP IDs and PAP passwords for multiple ISPs may be stored in the network services database certain locations may only have a single ISP . As a result a list of available dial in locations may contain one or more dial in numbers from one or more ISPs . Alternatively multiple ISPs may have PAP ID and PAP password sharing agreements allowing a single user PAP ID and PAP password entry in the network services database to generate a dial in location list from multiple ISPs . In any case the Busy Sequence sub function sequentially attempts to make a connection to an ISP at each location until either a successful connection is made or the user aborts the connection attempt.

When the multi dial procedure is initiated for any reason other than a busy signal the client dispatch application reconfigures or reinstalls the system configuration adaptor and protocol information necessary for network connection. Thereafter based on data in network services database it is determined whether or not to initiate a connection attempt to the Internet using a pre defined dial in number or location. If a connection is desired using a predefined dial in number or location the multi dial procedure uses one of four types of possible PAP IDs and PAP passwords. These types are defined as a multi dial PAP ID and PAP password a group PAP ID and PAP password a user PAP ID and PAP password and a test PAP ID and PAP password. 

When both the pre defined dial in number entry and a General Use entry are enabled in the network services database a general use connection to the Internet is established using either the group PAP ID and PAP password or the user PAP ID and PAP password . When the pre defined dial in number entry is enabled and the General Use entry is disabled then the multi dial procedure establishes a connection to the Internet using either the multi dial PAP ID and PAP password or the test PAP ID and PAP password . In either case the user s dial adaptor modem is configured with the ISP specific access information associated with the predefined dial in number. After proper configuration the client dispatch application automatically dials and attempts connection to the ISP . If the line is busy it is determined whether an alternate dial in number should be used. If an alternate number is not to be used the dial and connect is retried with the previous dial in number. If an alternate number is to be used the alternate dial number is read from the phone database and the user s dial adaptor modem is configured with the ISP specific access information associated with the alternate dial in number.

Upon successful connection if the connection is not a general use connection the Service Selected sub function is initiated a double dial procedure . If the connection is a general use connection the client dispatch application transmits pinger header information to the access service . In response the access service transmits information to the user client dispatch application . The multi dial procedure determines from this received information whether a transparent update is needed i.e. update information in the database s without user intervention . If so the client dispatch application updates the database s and determines whether a disconnect is required. If not the user continues regular use until disconnected by some other means. If so the user is notified and may be given the option to choose to disconnect or may be forced to disconnect.

If after a connection is made and the user has used a PAP ID and PAP password that is used by another in order to establish the user connection then the access service updates the user s database s possibly with a new and valid PAP ID and PAP password and the client dispatch application either disconnects the user and notifies the user that the PAP ID is not valid or allows the user to stay connected if the user has received a new and valid PAP ID . This particular process also applies to the regular use procedure see .

In the preferred embodiment when a pre defined dial in number entry in the network services database is disabled then the multi dial procedure executes one or more of the seven sub functions in response to entries in the network services database .

The Service Selected sub function reads pinger header information from the network services database and the user database and sends this information in a data message to the access service to the network server database . The access service uses the information to generate database updates including new PAP ID etc. which may or may not assign reassign or update ISPs dial in locations PAP IDs and PAP passwords dial in numbers network routing information Adapters Protocol or any other information stored in the databases . Such database updates are then transmitted to the user and the client dispatch application to update the appropriate database . After the database information is updated the user is disconnected and the Regular Use primary procedure is initiated using the updated information received from the access service .

The Low Cost sub function obtains information from both the network services database and the phone database and determines which ISP and what locations dial in phone numbers for local access have the lowest priced service for a given user s dial in location. The lowest cost sub function next determines if the user s PAP ID and PAP password stored in network services database are valid compare the current user s PAP ID and PAP password with the user s currently selected dial in location for the ISP that provides the low cost connection point of presence at the user s location. If the user PAP ID and PAP password are valid the network connection sequence will dial and connect as described in the regular use procedure . If the user PAP ID and PAP password are invalid then this sub function will initiate the manual update procedure requesting from the access service a valid user PAP ID and PAP password for the ISP s dial in network at the user selected location. Then the network connection sequence will dial as described in the regular use procedure .

The Reliability sub function obtains information from both the network services database and the phone database and determines which ISP and what locations dial in phone numbers for local access have the highest reliability of connecting the user to the Internet . This determination is based upon prior data reliability data transmitted to the client dispatch application from the access service that is used to update the user databases. This data transmission occurs during a previous session when the user is connected to the Internet . The reliability data is transferred by the access service to the users who have a reliability entry enabled in their network services database . The reliability sub function next determines if the user PAP ID and PAP password stored in the NS.db are valid compare the current user s PAP ID and PAP password with the user s currently selected dial in location for the ISP that provides the highest reliability at the selected location. When the user PAP ID and PAP password are valid the network connection sequence will dial and connect as described in the regular use procedure . When the user PAP ID and PAP password are invalid then this sub function will initiate the manual update procedure as described in connection with requesting from the access service a valid user PAP ID and PAP password for the ISP s dial in network at the user selected location. Then the network connection sequence will dial as described in the regular use procedure of .

Reliability refers to the ability to reliably connect on a first or second attempt availability and the ability to stay connected for a substantial period of time without disconnection due mainly because of line noise problems faulty equipment etc. integrity . Availability information used to determine availability of various ISPs and dial in numbers may include at least three types of information. The first type of information includes availability information that is received by the access service from the ISPs themselves typically updated periodically . The second type of information includes information in a client histogram client specific that is generated by the client dispatch application of the user . Over an extended time during which the user makes more and more connections to the Internet via an ISP the client dispatch application keeps track of the times a connection is made on the first try second try etc. for each dial in phone number and or ISP used by the user . From this a client specific histogram is generated that contains information about the past history of the user s connections. The third type of information includes information in a server histogram that is generated by the access service . The access service tracks and stores information relating to all ISPs and dial in numbers regarding past history connections. See also the description set forth below in the availability sub function description. As will be appreciated the reliability sub function may use any one of the types of availability information or combination thereof for determining the dial in number or multiple numbers in priority that will provide the user with a high reliability connection.

With respect to the integrity information used to determine the integrity of the various ISPs and dial in numbers there are at least two types of information. The first type of information includes information received via technical support inquiries to the access service by the users . If the access service receives a call or calls from users regarding faulty lines and or premature disconnects this information can be tabulated and stored for determining integrity. Since the access service stores data relative what ISP s and dial in number s a particular user has been using through information in the access service database gained through the pinging or heartbeat process described earlier the access service can determine which ISP s and or dial in number s have relatively high and or low integrity. In response to this information the access service can update the user s databases with this information. The second type of information includes information automatically gathered by the access service that includes a history of the number of users how long each has been connected and what ISP s and or dial in number s to which each user has been connected through information in the access service database gained through the pinging or heartbeat process described earlier . The access service can transmit the integrity data to the user for use by the reliability sub function of the client dispatch application . As will be appreciated the reliability sub function may use any one of the types of integrity information or combination thereof for determining the dial in number or multiple numbers in priority that will provide the user with a high reliability connection.

From a combination of the availability information and the integrity information the reliability sub function determines the dial in number or multiple numbers in priority that will provide the user with high reliability connection.

The Location sub function obtains information from the phone database and determines all the dial in phone numbers available to a user from a selected location. The location sub function generates a list of surrounding area locations into which user may dial. The user then selects a dial in number from this list. The location sub function next determines if the user PAP ID and PAP password stored in the network services database are valid compare the current user s PAP ID and PAP password with the user s currently selected dial in location for the ISP in which the user s computer will dial into the selected location. When the user PAP ID and PAP password are valid the network connection sequence will dial and connect as described in the regular use procedure . When the user PAP ID and PAP password are invalid this sub function will initiate the manual update procedure requesting from the access service a valid user PAP ID and PAP password for the ISP s dial in network at the user selected location. Then a network connection sequence will dial as described in the regular use procedure of .

The Availability sub function generates a dial in location number list based upon user PAP IDs and PAP passwords stored in the network services database and the type of service plan also found in the network services database to which a user has subscribed. If a user has chosen to subscribe to a higher cost plan multiple PAP IDs and PAP passwords for multiple ISPs may be stored in the network services database. Accordingly the list of available dial in locations may contain one or more multiple dial in numbers from one or more multiple ISPs . Alternatively multiple ISPs may have PAP ID and PAP password sharing agreements allowing a single user PAP ID and PAP password entry in the network services database to generate a dial in location list from multiple ISPs .

As will be appreciated the availability sub function utilizes the same type of availability information as described above in the reliability sub function.

The availability sub function utilizes one or more methods or the service selected sub function to increase the probability that the user at a given location will successfully connect on the first try. This functionality is based upon historical data Histogram data or real time data supplied by an ISP to the access service . The historical data may include two types of data Client Histogram data or Server Histogram data. To accomplish the availability function the Server Histogram data Client Histogram data or the service Selected sub function is utilized or any combination thereof is utilized as desired.

The Client Histogram data is based upon connection history of the user . The Client Histogram data is not as beneficial as other data until a particular user has consistently established a network connection to the Internet for a period of time sufficient to create a meaningful histogram. It has been determined that a period of at least ninety days is sufficient if a user accesses regularly. After a sufficient period of time a Client Histogram can be built to determine the probability of success of the user connecting to the network the first time. This minimizes the necessity of having the client dispatch application perform a second dial attempt to connect to the network .

The Server Histogram data is based upon the connection history of each particular ISP and its dial in numbers. This information is stored in the access service in response to the monitoring of all the users through the pinging process . The Server Histogram data is transmitted to the user s network services database upon any connection to the network when the availability sub function is enabled within the client dispatch application .

In the preferred embodiment the Server Histogram data is normally used in conjunction with the Client Histogram data when appropriate to determine the highest probability of success of connecting to the network without a second dialing attempt. Accordingly upon the user initiating a connection to the network the client dispatch application automatically selects a dial in phone number that it has determined to have a high probability of success for connection. Thus the Client Histogram data and the Server Histogram data are used to facilitate a statistical approach to determine the highest probability of a user connecting to the network on the first attempt.

However there may be times when a user desires a very high confidence near 100 or 100 connection or the Histogram data is not desired to be used such as when the data for a particular area is unreliable i.e. certain geographic areas may have insufficient telecommunications infrastructure that may skew the data and therefore possibly useless. In these cases the service selected sub function is initiated and a double dial process takes place see and the description of service selected sub function . In the service selected sub routing availability information of ISPs is used by the access service to give the user a dial in number that is available. This availability information for the ISPs is periodically transmitted or given to the access service typically every five minutes. The double dial process is also exemplified in and the accompanying text.

The last sub function of the multi dial procedure is the Single dial Multi Login sub function. Initiation of the single dial multi login sub function requires a multi dial attempt only when the user receives a busy signal otherwise this sub function is a single dial function with a multiple PAP ID and PAP password assignment reassignment function. This function the assignment reassignment requires that all user client authentication for all ISPs happens at the access service i.e. all authentication for all ISPs is centralized or at a centrally located database point. Thus this function works with multiple ISPs when each allows user authentication to take place at a centrally located server independent of each ISP s own user authentication server. For example an ISP that has its own Authentication Server and who resells the underlying ISPs modem access to a user may support this function by allowing a user to dial and connect using an Initial Access PAP ID and PAP password then assigning a unique session PAP ID and PAP password and re logging into the Authentication server without disconnecting the user . This eliminates the time that would otherwise be required to disconnect and re dial using a newly assigned PAP ID and PAP password.

The client dispatch application also functions to provide users with network identity anonymity. That is the architecture of the client dispatch application provides anonymity for users during access to the network as IDs and passwords such IDs and passwords would include PAP IDs and PAP passwords Email IDs and Email passwords NEWS IDs and NEWS passwords FTP and Web Space IDs and passwords and custom network application IDs and passwords can be dynamically reassigned for a given user a given system a given group of users a given group of systems or any combination thereof. Thus if a user has three computer systems A Computer B Computer and C Computer each requires a unique user system identification which is generated during installation and registration and stored in the client s network service database and or the user database . This unique user system identification allows the access service to maintain unique and independent IDs and passwords for the user system pair. Thus when a user connects the A Computer to the network unique IDs and passwords which may be distinctly different from the B Computer and C Computer s IDs and passwords stored in the network services database and or the user database may be used to transparently log the user into such things as the network Email FTP Web Space NEWS groups Bulletin Boards or any other application requiring login identification and password. Thus the architecture supports single life IDs and or passwords for all network and application logins.

Now referring to there is illustrated a block diagram of a storage medium and a computer . The storage medium includes client dispatch application computer program and may also include the databases . The computer also includes a means not shown for reading or downloading the client dispatch application computer program into the computer to cause the computer to perform one or more steps in accordance with the principles of the present invention. As will be appreciated the storage medium may include a floppy or hard disk magnetic or optical taps or any other data storage medium known presently or developed in the future for storing a computer program such as the client dispatch application of the present invention.

As will be realized by those skilled in the art of email electronic mail sent between parties on a network email is typically held in a post office box type storage facility at the recipients ISP until retrieved by the recipient. However the ISP typically keeps a copy of the email for a period of time after receipt thereof for various purposes. Many people have the technical capability to access and read these stored messages at the ISP. Even where the message body is encrypted considerable information may be gleaned over a period of time by keeping track of who is sending messages to whom the frequency of messages to given parties and data gleaned from the subject matter portion of the header.

The structure of the present invention combined with an email program software plug in for a standard email program or browser lends itself to a method of minimizing the possibility of unauthorized gleaning of information from email and further minimizes the possibility of spamming where spamming is defined as the sending of large amounts of email to a given recipient for harassment like purposes.

One way to minimize the gleaning of information is to send all mail through a third party to recipients. The third party acts as a trusted banker or broker. Such an operation is shown diagrammatically in where the sender sends the email to a Broker. The broker repackages email as deemed appropriate by agreement with the sender and or the recipient and sends it on its way. The simplest form is to merely place the entire original message including header information in message body of the email and send the package to the recipient with the recipient also listed as the sender and placing an innocuous subject in the visible header.

A next level of security is for either the sender or the broker or both to encrypt the package sent by that party to the next party. This could result in double encryption of the message body. Similar plug in software comprising part of the recipients email program software plug in for a standard email program or browser may be used to decipher the received package and the original email would then be recreated for reading by the recipient. The deciphering may be accomplished by keys transmitted by the pinger entity to the recipients software. As part of this next level of security the email sent to the broker or third party in a preferred embodiment of this invention has the TO and FROM portions of the visible header listing the broker has the subject changed to innocuous data and the entire original message encrypted as shown in the drawing.

There may be times that the sender of email may not want the recipient to know the senders true identity or even the network service provider of the sender. Alternatively the sender may wish to use different aliases or names for different classes of email contacts so that the sender may quickly sort incoming mail into a set of priority stacks. Further the recipient of email in a system using the present invention may have similar requirements. illustrates a second order anonymity header process for email transmission.

In this figure a block represents a standard header of email composed by the sender. When the sender has completed the email and posts it the senders email program software plug in for a standard email program or browser plug in intercepts the email and checks the appropriate database. It is determined in block that for identity me other.com the address alias alias.com should be used. The plug in software thus creates a new header in substitution for the one composed by the sender and encrypts the entire message including the altered header as shown in the lower portion of block . The software then consults the database represented by block and determines that the most recent data received from the pinger entity suggests that the network service provider to be used for other.com in this instance should be netsafe.com . Accordingly a new anonymous header is prepared in accordance with that shown in block before the message is forwarded to a third party for retransmission to the recipient.

As shown in the third party or broker receives the email as represented by block where is identical to block . The software in the server of the third party as set forth in block decrypts the stored header information after noting the form of the visible header information. It is able to do so because the pinger entity that determines the encryption code to be used in the senders encryption process and provides the senders database with the third party to be used also informs the third party the encryption code to be used for deciphering. This code may be part of the visible message id or may be inserted in the server database of that specific third party. If the recipient has signed up for anonymity service the server will retrieve from its database a presently assigned alias for the recipient. Whether or not an alias is used for the recipient the third party server will rebuild the header using an address for the recipient in both the TO and FROM portions of the visible header as shown in block .

The generation of software for intercepting a message consulting a database altering header data in accordance with the database encrypting the entire message including the altered header and then creating a new header before sending the entire data package is well within the capability of anyone skilled in the art of network computer programing in view of the presentation in and the accompanying explanatory material. As will be apparent the software will be different for each different operating system email program software plug in for a standard email program or browser and thus no pseudo code or detailed flow diagram has been presented herein.

In an illustrative commentary is provided of the databases and their contents upon initial installation of software of a new client wishing to access the services of the present invention.

In a selection menu is representative of a display that would be presented upon a clients system for selecting a test location to initially use the software installed in . The phone database is represented by while the NS network services database is represented by . When the client selects a city in TX such as Plano the software will note the number 1 at the end of the data of database . In the NS database a 1 is shown to refer to UUNET services. As may be observed if Garland had been picked a 2 would have been detected and PSINet services would be used. As shown by arrow line the software would determine that the test location number is 519 the PAPID to be used is nsTEST and the PAP password is zzzwww123 . Other data that may be utilized is also contained in the database.

In the clients computer is designated as the network as the network access provider as and the pinger entity as . The test and update procedure is illustrated. The first action is for to connect through the NAP shown within network cloud to using the PAPID and PAP passwork in the NS database for the selected NAP. As set forth in these values would be nsTEST and zzzwww123 . The NAP validates or authenticates the ID and password. For security reasons the test ID and registration ID network connection in a preferred embodiment of the invention is limited to 90 seconds. The system initiates a full network protocol test to the pinger by sending information about the client s system and the software revision installed therein. As will be realized the installed database includes the address of an appropriate pinger . The pinger after receiving the information performs minimal processing on the received data and sends back any update information such as DNS changes Phone number updates and the like. The pinger may then send back some static information as well as any further update information that the system may require. The client software in checks the static information received validates a reliable connection and then processes any update information for storage in an appropriate location s .

When the pinger receives the notification the date and time of receipt in logged along with the clients authentication token and the network address assigned to the client by the selected NAP. The pinger returns a response which may from time to time include a new authentication token in addition to data requested when the client is in the Anonymous Mode . It should be noted that the pinger entities such as may be used to facilitate Client side Authentication when used in conjunction with servers such as and as examples. The client or others attempting to access the system does not have access to the information contained in any of the client databases and the client and others cannot spoof a commerce server into believing that a transaction is originating somewhere else or by someone else.

From the above discourse it may be appreciated that the various databases residing at the access provider and each of the clients systems along with a script language such as MOT and the two way communication between clients and an access provider permits dynamic or constantly changeable network access and encryption parameters to minimize the possibility of unauthorized access to the network access provider or its clients communications. This is accomplished by 

With respect to item 1 above since a user s network login and password change periodically transparent to the user client and they are hidden from the user so as to be not accessible by the user network fraud and abuse may be significantly reduced. Further the dynamic assignment process allows the login access to be different from system to system. Since the physical address of a server can be changed on any random or periodic basis Item 2 causes a significant reduction in the risk of service attacks network lockouts and unauthorized access to data. The dynamic assigning and reassigning of email alias as occurs in accordance with Item 3 significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized viewing of a given clients email messages. The changing domain aliases minimizes the risk of denial of access service while the dynamically generated and authenticated session IDs for network commerce reduces the risk of fraud.

In addition to the above discussion and description the present invention is also described and disclosed in Appendices A B and C which are hereby incorporated by reference.

Although the invention has been described with reference to a specific embodiment these descriptions are not meant to be construed in a limiting sense. Various modifications of the disclosed embodiments as well as alternative embodiments of the invention will become apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reference to the description of the invention. It should also be noted that while terms such as network device user may be used to describe a single client it may also be used to describe a network of users having a common factor such as an employer. It is therefore contemplated that the claims will cover any such modifications or embodiments that fall within the true scope of the invention.
