title: Calculating and broadcasting an area's population density based on cell signal
abstract: The subject technology determines population density of an area in order to map one or more persons to smaller areas such as bathrooms, stores, and lines. Based on a user's current geolocation, the subject technology utilizes one or more nearby wireless signals transmitted from computing devices to determine a population density of an area near the user's geolocation. The signals from each device can include unique IDs for identifying the device associated with the ID. Mobile devices such as cell phones constantly broadcast a cell signal and/or other types of signals with unique identifiers. These signals are anonymized to protect any personal information associated with the mobile devices transmitting these signals while still being able associate a device to a respective signal. The subject technology therefore can determine an area's population density based on these anonymized signals by detecting one or more associated devices near the geolocation of the user.

An online electronic map can display a geographic area. A user can view the online electronic map to locate points of interests.

The subject technology provides for determining a population density of an area based at least on a geolocation of a user. The subject technology receives a geolocation shared by a user. An area of interest of the user is then determined in which the area of interest is determined in part by the geolocation shared by the user. The subject technology then determines one or more computing devices in proximity to the determined area of interest of the user based on one or more wireless signals transmitted from the one or more computing devices. Further a population density of an area is determined near the determined area of interest of the user based on the determined one or more computing devices in proximity to the determined area of interest of the user. The population density of the area represents a level of activity by one or more persons.

Yet another aspect of the subject technology provides a system for determining a population density of an area based at least on a geolocation of a user.

The system also includes a wireless signal detection module configured to determine one or more computing devices in proximity to the determined area of interest of the user based on one or more wireless signals transmitted from the one or more computing devices. The system further includes a population density processing module configured to determine a population density of an area near the determined area of interest of the user based on the determined one or more computing devices in proximity to the determined area of interest of the user in which the population density of the area represents a level of activity by one or more persons. The population density of the area indicates an estimated number of persons present in the area. Additionally the system includes a graphical user interface GUI display module configured to provide for display an electronic map including the determined population density of the area near the determined area of interest of the user.

The subject technology further provides for receiving a geolocation shared by a user. An area of interest of the user is determined in which the area of interest is determined in part by the geolocation shared by the user. The subject technology determines one or more computing devices in proximity to the determined area of interest of the user based on one or more wireless signals transmitted from the one or more computing devices. The one or more wireless signals transmitted from the one or more computing devices includes at least one of a cellular signal near field communication signal and short wavelength radio signal. The subject technology determines a population density of an area near the determined area of interest of the user based on the determined one or more computing devices in proximity to the determined area of interest of the user. The population density of the area represents a level of activity by one or more persons. Further the population density of the area indicates an estimated number of persons present in the area. The subject technology provides for display an electronic map including the determined population density of the area near the determined area of interest of the user.

It is understood that other configurations of the subject technology will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description wherein various configurations of the subject technology are shown and described by way of illustration. As will be realized the subject technology is capable of other and different configurations and its several details are capable of modification in various other respects all without departing from the scope of the subject technology. Accordingly the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.

The detailed description set forth below is intended as a description of various configurations of the subject technology and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the subject technology may be practiced. The appended drawings are incorporated herein and constitute a part of the detailed description. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the subject technology. However it will be clear and apparent to those skilled in the art that the subject technology is not limited to the specific details set forth herein and may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances well known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the subject technology.

At an event or location it can be difficult to determine a population density of an area inside the event or location. For instance trying to find an unoccupied bathroom at a stadium or the shortest line for food at a mall can be a reoccurring problem for a person s at the event or location. Finding the least populated area can be useful for discovering one or more less densely populated areas with respect to the event or location in order to avoid a crowd or a long line. In some configurations a user can opt in to sharing geolocation information based on a current geolocation of the user and or check in activity of the user. In one example the user can check in to a place e.g. restaurant stadium bar grocery store etc. to share the user s geolocation information.

To address the aforementioned issues for determining population density of an area based on the user s current geolocation the subject technology can utilize one or more nearby signals transmitted from one or more devices e.g. a cell phone tablet computer etc. to determine a population density of an area near the user s geolocation. The signals from each device can include unique IDs for identifying the device associated with the ID in some configurations. By way of example mobile devices such as cell phones constantly broadcast a cell signal including a cell phone ID and or other types of signals with unique identifiers e.g. Bluetooth near field communication etc. . These signals in one example can be anonymized to protect any personal information associated with the mobile devices transmitting these signals while still being able associate a device to a respective signal. The subject technology therefore can determine an area s population density based on these anonymized signals by detecting one or more associated devices near the geolocation of the user.

The subject technology detects the aforementioned types of signals from mobile devices in order to map one or more persons to smaller areas such as bathrooms stores and lines based on the user s current geolocation. In one example the subject technology could then determine the amount of persons to the amount of space available at the event or location. Further the subject can provide an electronic map that highlights an area s of high population density and an area s of low population density e.g. to enable a user to determine an available bathroom s or if a place will be crowded .

Additionally population density could be determined by sensors in the environment e.g. from Wi Fi routers or cell repeaters in the area or from sensors built into a mobile device e.g. cell phone . For example if the user s mobile device was monitoring how many other cell phones were competing to communicate with a cell tower the user s device could approximate the number of people near by and transmit this population density information to a server for processing.

Based on the determined population density of the area businesses could use this population density information to track patron population density e.g. a number of visitors . For instance a store could track the amount of traffic experienced within the last few days weeks months or to see if certain promotions or seasons brought higher or lower amounts of population density. In this manner the subject technology can assist a business with managing staff availability and or logistical decisions in order to more efficiently run the business.

In situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users or may make use of personal information the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information e.g. information about a user s social network social actions or activities profession a user s preferences or a user s current location or to control whether and or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example a user s identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user or a user s geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained such as to a city ZIP code or state level so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server. Moreover as described herein demographic related data may be aggregated for one or more groups of users so that an individual user s is not personally identifiable.

The process begins at by receiving a geolocation shared by a user. The shared geolocation is based on a user s current geolocation in one example. In an example in which the user has opted in to sharing location information the user s geolocation is automatically detected in some configurations e.g. via one or more location gathering techniques such as GPS etc. . In another example the user s geolocation is shared responsive to the user s check in activity. As used herein the term check in refers to user activity that allows the user to share his or her current location to other users e.g. in an online social network . For instance location status updates can be provided in a social networking service to enable users to communicate a message associated with an identified geolocation of a user. In the context of a social networking service a check in can be understood as a post associated with a geolocation or place that is typically included in the user s profile stream.

In some configurations the shared geolocation is associated with a physical location such as an identified place a business an airport a metropolitan area a neighborhood a municipality or a tourist attraction etc. The term place refers to a geographic area with definite or indefinite boundaries in one example. The shared geolocation can be associated to other types of areas and still be within the scope of the subject technology. In one example the shared geolocation is associated with an event occurring at a location.

The process at determines an area of interest of the user. In one example the area of interest is determined in part by the geolocation shared by the user. For instance the determined area of interest includes the geolocation of the user. The area of interest comprises a geographic area within a predetermined distance from a detected geolocation of the user. In one example the determined area of interest of the user is associated with a place business or event in one example e.g. the user s geolocation indicates that the user is currently located there or within a predetermined distance near it . The geographic area includes defined or undefined boundaries or an interior space of a structure or building. Different areas and or rooms within the interior space of the building are included in the area of interest in one example. Additionally determining the area of interest of the user is responsive to check in activity of the user in one example.

The process at determines one or more computing devices in proximity to the determined area of interest of the user based on one or more wireless signals transmitted from the one or more computing devices. One or more wireless signals transmitted from the one or more computing devices includes at least one of a cellular signal near field communication signal and short wavelength radio signal. Other types of wireless signals can detected and still be within the scope of the subject technology. Determining the one or more computing devices in proximity to the determined area of interest of the user is based on the associated place business or event e.g. as described above in one example. The one or more wireless signals transmitted from the one or more devices include one or more unique identifiers for associating a respective signal from the one or more wireless signals to a respective computing device among the one or more computing devices. Determining one or more computing devices in proximity to the determined area of interest of the user is further based on a Wi Fi signal or cellular repeater signal detected from the one or more computing devices.

The process at determines a population density of an area near the determined area of interest of the user based on the determined one or more computing devices in proximity to the determined area of interest of the user. Determining the population density of the area near the determined area of interest is based on a threshold distance from the geolocation of the user. Further the population density of the area represents a level of activity by one or more persons. More specifically the population density of the area indicates an estimated number of persons present in the area. Based on the population density of the area the level of activity is at least one of a high medium or low level of activity. With respect to the area a higher population density indicates a higher level of activity while a lower population density indicates a lower level of activity. In order to track potentially changing levels of population density determining the population density of the area near the determined area of interest of the user occurs on a periodic basis in one example.

The process at provides for display an electronic map including the determined population density of the area near the determined area of interest of the user. An example graphical user interface GUI illustrating an electronic map is described in further detail in . The process then ends.

The process at determines a second area of interest of the user. In one example the area of interest is determined in part by the geolocation shared by the user. The process at determines one or more computing devices in proximity to the determined second area of interest of the user based on one or more signals transmitted from the one or more computing devices. As described above the one or more wireless signals transmitted from the one or more computing devices includes at least one of a cellular signal near field communication signal short wavelength radio signal Wi Fi signal cell repeater signal etc.

The process at determines a population density of an area near the determined second area of interest of the user based on the determined one or more computing devices in proximity to the determined second area of interest of the first user.

The process at compares the population density of the area near the determined second area of interest to the population density of the area near the determined area of interest. The process at determines if the population density of second area of interest is lesser or greater population density than population density of the area of interest.

The process at provides a suggestion to the user based on the determination if the second area of interest is lesser or greater population density than the population density of the area of interest. In one example the suggestion is a message that describes a suggested route for the user. For instance the suggestion can be a message such as The area near the bathroom is crowded right now. Please use the alternate bathroom on the other side of the building. In another example the message is a notification indicating high or medium levels of population densities in order to alert the user. Other types of messages can be provided and still be within the scope of the subject technology. The process then ends.

As illustrated in the GUI includes a widget including text display areas and . As used herein the term widget refers to a lightweight application e.g. lightweight in comparison to a full application suite or software package providing a GUI that includes one or more graphical elements used to provide a specific application. In the example GUI the display areas and include information indicating population densities in respective areas illustrated as areas A B and C . For instance each of the display areas and include a respective message showing a population density corresponding to a respective area on an electronic map described in further detail below. As shown in the example GUI the messages are displayed in vertical descending order e.g. from top to bottom based on a level of population density e.g. high medium low . Other ways to display the messages can be provided and still be within the scope of the subject technology.

The GUI includes an electronic map that includes an area of interest as indicated by a dashed circle. The area of interest defines a predetermined proximity in which one or more population density measurements can be made based on different wireless signals. In one example the area of interest is user selectable e.g. via a touch input selection mouse click selection etc. to increase or decrease a distance threshold in which population density measurements are provided. The electronic map includes map location point indicating a geolocation of a user. The electronic map further includes different map areas and shown as areas A B and C . In the example GUI each of the map areas and include respective graphical representations of the population density determined in each of the map areas and . As shown each of the map areas correspond to different areas within an interior space of a building e.g. an airport as shown in the GUI and respective population density measurements are made within the interior space of the building. In this manner the GUI can provide information related to detected populations densities for the building and by extension different rooms and areas within the building .

Other types of graphical representations can be utilized to indicate population density and still be within the scope of the subject technology than the example shown in the example GUI . Further although the example GUI illustrates one area of interest it should be appreciated that more than one area of interest can be shown in the GUI and still be within the scope of the subject technology.

Although the example GUI in includes four different messages or posts any number of messages can be included in the GUI and still be within the scope of the subject technology. As further shown in the GUI the button is provided by the GUI in order to display one or more additional messages.

Additionally although the above description of includes different example graphical elements in the GUI some implementations can include other graphical elements in the GUI and still be within the scope of the subject technology. Further the GUI is not required to include all of the aforementioned graphical elements.

The system can include memory one or more processors and one or more modules stored in memory and configured for execution by the one or more processors. As shown in the system includes several modules for providing different functionality. The system is configured to include a geolocation module an area of interest module wireless signal detection module a population density processing module and a GUI display module .

The geolocation module is configured to receive a geolocation shared by a user. The area of interest module is configured to determine an area of interest of the user in which the area of interest is determined in part by the geolocation shared by the user. The area of interest includes a geographic area within a predetermined distance from the geolocation shared by the user in one example. The wireless signal detection module is configured to determine one or more computing devices in proximity to the determined area of interest of the user based on one or more wireless signals transmitted from the one or more computing devices. The population density processing module is configured to determine a population density of an area near the determined area of interest of the user based on the determined one or more computing devices in proximity to the determined area of interest of the user in which the population density of the area represents a level of activity by one or more persons. The population density of the area indicates an estimated number of persons present in the area in one example. The GUI display module is configured to provide for display an electronic map including the determined population density of the area near the determined area of interest of the user.

In some configurations the geolocation module is further configured to determine a second area of interest of the user. The area of interest module is further configured to determine one or more computing devices in proximity to the determined second area of interest of the user based on one or more signals transmitted from the one or more computing devices. The wireless signal detection module is further configured to determine a population density of an area near the determined second area of interest of the user based on the determined one or more computing devices in proximity to the determined second area of interest of the first user. The population density processing module is further configured to compare the population density of the area near the determined second area of interest to the population density of the area near the determined area of interest determine if the population density of second area of interest is lesser or greater population density than population density of the area of interest and provide a suggestion to the user based on the determination if the second area of interest is lesser or greater population density than the population density of the area of interest.

As further shown in each of the aforementioned modules can be configured to communicate between each other. For instance different data messages API calls and returns can be passed between the different modules in the system .

The system can communicate over a network with a client device . The client device can each be configured to communicate with the aforementioned modules of the system . For instance the client device can transmit a request for determining a population density of an area of interest over the network to the system . The system can then transmit data responsive to the request and other requests over the network to the client device . As further shown in other client device s can communicate over the network with the system in a similar manner.

Many of the above described features and applications are implemented as software processes that are specified as a set of instructions recorded on a non transitory machine readable storage medium also referred to as computer readable medium . When these instructions are executed by one or more processing unit s e.g. one or more processors cores of processors or other processing units they cause the processing unit s to perform the actions indicated in the instructions. Examples of machine readable media include but are not limited to CD ROMs flash drives RAM chips hard drives EPROMs etc. The machine readable media does not include carrier waves and electronic signals passing wirelessly or over wired connections.

In this specification the term software is meant to include firmware residing in read only memory and or applications stored in magnetic storage which can be read into memory for processing by a processor. Also in some implementations multiple software components can be implemented as sub parts of a larger program while remaining distinct software components. In some implementations multiple software subject components can also be implemented as separate programs. Finally any combination of separate programs that together implement a software component s described here is within the scope of the subject technology. In some implementations the software programs when installed to operate on one or more systems define one or more specific machine implementations that execute and perform the operations of the software programs.

A computer program also known as a program software software application script or code can be written in any form of programming language including compiled or interpreted languages declarative or procedural languages and it can be deployed in any form including as a stand alone program or as a module component subroutine object or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program may but need not correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data e.g. one or more scripts stored in a markup language document in a single file dedicated to the program in question or in multiple coordinated files e.g. files that store one or more modules sub programs or portions of code . A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.

Some configurations are implemented as software processes that include one or more application programming interfaces APIs in an environment with calling program code interacting with other program code being called through the one or more interfaces. Various function calls messages or other types of invocations which can include various kinds of parameters can be transferred via the APIs between the calling program and the code being called. In addition an API can provide the calling program code the ability to use data types or classes defined in the API and implemented in the called program code.

One or more APIs may be used in some configurations. An API is an interface implemented by a program code component or hardware component API implementing component that allows a different program code component or hardware component API calling component to access and use one or more functions methods procedures data structures classes and or other services provided by the API implementing component. An API can define one or more parameters that are passed between the API calling component and the API implementing component.

An API allows a developer of an API calling component that could be a third party developer to utilize specified features provided by an API implementing component. There may be one API calling component or there may be more than one such component. An API can be a source code interface that a computing system or program library provides to support requests for services from an application. An operating system OS can have multiple APIs to allow applications running on the OS to call one or more of those APIs and a service such as a program library can have multiple APIs to allow an application that uses the service to call one or more of those APIs. An API can be specified in terms of a programming language that can be interpreted or compiled when an application is built.

In some configurations the API implementing component may provide more than one API each providing a different view of or with different aspects that access different aspects of the functionality implemented by the API implementing component. For example one API of an API implementing component can provide a first set of functions and can be exposed to third party developers and another API of the API implementing component can be hidden not exposed and provide a subset of the first set of functions and also provide another set of functions such as testing or debugging functions which are not in the first set of functions. In other configurations the API implementing component may itself call one or more other components via an underlying API and thus be both an API calling component and an API implementing component.

An API defines the language and parameters that API calling components use when accessing and using specified features of the API implementing component. For example an API calling component accesses the specified features of the API implementing component through one or more API calls or invocations embodied for example by function or method calls exposed by the API and passes data and control information using parameters via the API calls or invocations. The API implementing component may return a value through the API in response to an API call from an API calling component. While the API defines the syntax and result of an API call e.g. how to invoke the API call and what the API call does the API may not reveal how the API call accomplishes the function specified by the API call. Various API calls are transferred via the one or more application programming interfaces between the calling API calling component and an API implementing component. Transferring the API calls may include issuing initiating invoking calling receiving returning or responding to the function calls or messages. In other words transferring can describe actions by either of the API calling component or the API implementing component. The function calls or other invocations of the API may send or receive one or more parameters through a parameter list or other structure. A parameter can be a constant key data structure object object class variable data type pointer array list or a pointer to a function or method or another way to reference a data or other item to be passed via the API.

Furthermore data types or classes may be provided by the API and implemented by the API implementing component. The API calling component therefore can declare variables use pointers to use or instantiate constant values of such types or classes by using definitions provided in the API.

Generally an API can be used to access a service or data provided by the API implementing component or to initiate performance of an operation or computation provided by the API implementing component. By way of example the API implementing component and the API calling component may each be any one of an operating system a library a device driver an API an application program or other module it should be understood that the API implementing component and the API calling component may be the same or different type of module from each other . API implementing components may in some cases be embodied at least in part in firmware microcode or other hardware logic. In some configurations an API may allow a client program to use the services provided by a Software Development Kit SDK library. In other configurations an application or other client program may use an API provided by an Application Framework. In these configurations the application or client program may incorporate calls to functions or methods provided by the SDK and provided by the API or use data types or objects defined in the SDK and provided by the API. An Application Framework may in these configurations provide a main event loop for a program that responds to various events defined by the Framework. The API allows the application to specify the events and the responses to the events using the Application Framework. In some implementations an API call can report to an application the capabilities or state of a hardware device including those related to aspects such as input capabilities and state output capabilities and state processing capability power state storage capacity and state communications capability etc. and the API may be implemented in part by firmware microcode or other low level logic that executes in part on the hardware component.

The API calling component may be a local component i.e. on the same data processing system as the API implementing component or a remote component i.e. on a different data processing system from the API implementing component that communicates with the API implementing component through the API over a network. It should be understood that an API implementing component may also act as an API calling component i.e. it may make API calls to an API exposed by a different API implementing component and an API calling component may also act as an API implementing component by implementing an API that is exposed to a different API calling component.

The API can allow multiple API calling components written in different programming languages to communicate with the API implementing component thus the API may include features for translating calls and returns between the API implementing component and the API calling component . The API however can be implemented in terms of a specific programming language. An API calling component can in one configuration call APIs from different providers such as a set of APIs from an OS provider and another set of APIs from a plug in provider and another set of APIs from another provider e.g. the provider of a software library or creator of the another set of APIs.

The following description describes an example API architecture in which some configurations of the subject technology can be implemented.

It will be appreciated that the API implementing component can include additional functions methods classes data structures and or other features that are not specified through the API and are not available to the API calling component . It should be understood that the API calling component can be on the same system as the API implementing component or can be located remotely and accesses the API implementing component using the API over a network. While illustrates a single API calling component interacting with the API it should be understood that other API calling components which can be written in different languages or the same language than the API calling component can use the API .

The API implementing component the API and the API calling component can be stored in a machine readable medium which includes any mechanism for storing information in a form readable by a machine e.g. a computer or other data processing system . For example a machine readable medium includes magnetic disks optical disks random access memory read only memory flash memory devices etc.

The peripherals interface can be coupled to various sensors and subsystems including a camera subsystem a wireless communication subsystem s audio subsystem and Input Output subsystem . The peripherals interface enables communication between processors and peripherals. The peripherals provide different functionality for the mobile device. Peripherals such as an orientation sensor or an acceleration sensor can be coupled to the peripherals interface to facilitate the orientation and acceleration functions. Additionally the mobile device can include a location sensor to provide different location data. In particular the location sensor can utilize a Global Positioning System GPS to provide different location data such as longitude latitude and altitude.

The camera subsystem can be coupled to one or more optical sensors such as a charged coupled device CCD optical sensor or a complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS optical sensor. The camera subsystem coupled with the sensors can facilitate camera functions such as image and or video data capturing. Wireless communication subsystems can serve to facilitate communication functions. Wireless communication subsystems can include radio frequency receivers and transmitters and optical receivers and transmitters. The aforementioned receivers and transmitters can be implemented to operate over one or more communication networks such as a Long Term Evolution LTE Global System for Mobile Communications GSM network a Wi Fi network Bluetooth network etc. The audio subsystem is coupled to a speaker and a microphone to facilitate voice enabled functions such as voice recognition digital recording etc.

I O subsystem involves the transfer between input output peripheral devices such as a display a touchscreen etc. and the data bus of the processor through the Peripherals Interface. I O subsystem can include a touchscreen controller and other input controllers to facilitate these functions. Touchscreen controller can be coupled to the touchscreen and detect contact and movement on the screen using any of multiple touch sensitivity technologies. Other input controllers can be coupled to other input control devices such as one or more buttons.

Memory interface can be coupled to memory which can include high speed random access memory and or non volatile memory such as flash memory. Memory can store an operating system OS . The OS can include instructions for handling basic system services and for performing hardware dependent tasks.

By way of example memory can also include communication instructions to facilitate communicating with one or more additional devices graphical user interface instructions to facilitate graphic user interface processing image video processing instructions to facilitate image video related processing and functions phone instructions to facilitate phone related processes and functions media exchange and processing instructions to facilitate media communication and processing related processes and functions camera instructions to facilitate camera related processes and functions and video conferencing instructions to facilitate video conferencing processes and functions. The above identified instructions need not be implemented as separate software programs or modules. Various functions of mobile device can be implemented in hardware and or in software including in one or more signal processing and or application specific integrated circuits.

The following description describes an example system in which aspects of the subject technology can be implemented.

The bus collectively represents all system peripheral and chipset buses that communicatively connect the numerous internal devices of the system . For instance the bus communicatively connects the processing unit s with the read only memory the system memory and the storage device .

From these various memory units the processing unit s retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of the subject technology. The processing unit s can be a single processor or a multi core processor in different implementations.

The read only memory ROM stores static data and instructions that are needed by the processing unit s and other modules of the system . The storage device on the other hand is a read and write memory device. This device is a non volatile memory unit that stores instructions and data even when the system is off. Some implementations of the subject technology use a mass storage device such as a magnetic or optical disk and its corresponding disk drive as the storage device .

Other implementations use a removable storage device such as a flash drive a floppy disk and its corresponding disk drive as the storage device . Like the storage device the system memory is a read and write memory device. However unlike storage device the system memory is a volatile read and write memory such a random access memory. The system memory stores some of the instructions and data that the processor needs at runtime. In some implementations the subject technology s processes are stored in the system memory the storage device and or the read only memory . For example the various memory units include instructions for processing multimedia items in accordance with some implementations. From these various memory units the processing unit s retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of some implementations.

The bus also connects to the optional input and output interfaces and . The optional input interface enables the user to communicate information and select commands to the system. The optional input interface can interface with alphanumeric keyboards and pointing devices also called cursor control devices . The optional output interface can provide display images generated by the system . The optional output interface can interface with printers and display devices such as cathode ray tubes CRT or liquid crystal displays LCD . Some implementations can interface with devices such as a touchscreen that functions as both input and output devices.

Finally as shown in bus also couples system to a network interface through a network adapter not shown . In this manner the computer can be a part of a network of computers such as a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN or an Intranet or an interconnected network of networks such as the Internet. Any or all components of system can be used in conjunction with the subject technology.

These functions described above can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry in computer software firmware or hardware. The techniques can be implemented using one or more computer program products. Programmable processors and computers can be included in or packaged as mobile devices. The processes and logic flows can be performed by one or more programmable processors and by one or more programmable logic circuitry. General and special purpose computing devices and storage devices can be interconnected through communication networks.

Some implementations include electronic components such as microprocessors storage and memory that store computer program instructions in a non transitory machine readable or non transitory computer readable medium alternatively referred to as computer readable storage media machine readable media or machine readable storage media . Some examples of such computer readable media include RAM ROM read only compact discs CD ROM recordable compact discs CD R rewritable compact discs CD RW read only digital versatile discs e.g. DVD ROM dual layer DVD ROM a variety of recordable rewritable DVDs e.g. DVD RAM DVD RW DVD RW etc. flash memory e.g. SD cards mini SD cards micro SD cards etc. magnetic and or solid state hard drives read only and recordable Blu Ray discs ultra density optical discs any other optical or magnetic media and floppy disks. The computer readable media can store a computer program that is executable by at least one processing unit and includes sets of instructions for performing various operations. Examples of computer programs or computer code include machine code such as is produced by a compiler and files including higher level code that are executed by a computer an electronic component or a microprocessor using an interpreter.

While the above discussion primarily refers to microprocessor or multi core processors that execute software some implementations are performed by one or more integrated circuits such as application specific integrated circuits ASICs or field programmable gate arrays FPGAs . In some implementations such integrated circuits execute instructions that are stored on the circuit itself.

As used in this specification and any claims of this application the terms computer server processor and memory all refer to electronic or other technological devices. These terms exclude people or groups of people. For the purposes of the specification the terms display or displaying means displaying on an electronic device. As used in this specification and any claims of this application the terms computer readable medium and computer readable media are entirely restricted to tangible physical objects that store information in a form that is readable by a computer. These terms exclude any wireless signals wired download signals and any other ephemeral signals.

To provide for interaction with a user implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a computer having a display device e.g. a CRT cathode ray tube or LCD liquid crystal display monitor for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device e.g. a mouse or a trackball by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well for example feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback e.g. visual feedback auditory feedback or tactile feedback and input from the user can be received in any form including acoustic speech or tactile input. In addition a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used by the user for example by sending web pages to a web browser on a user s client device in response to requests received from the web browser.

Configurations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component e.g. as a data server or that includes a middleware component e.g. an application server or that includes a front end component e.g. a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification or any combination of one or more such back end middleware or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication e.g. a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network LAN and a wide area network WAN an inter network e.g. the Internet and peer to peer networks e.g. ad hoc peer to peer networks .

The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client server relationship to each other. In some configurations a server transmits data e.g. an HTML page to a client device e.g. for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device . Data generated at the client device e.g. a result of the user interaction can be received from the client device at the server.
