Such a module may be a distinct electronic circuit within the device but the present disclosure may not be limited in this regard. In some instances a distinct circuits may include multiple modules e.g. a sensor module may contain multiple sensor like gyro accelerometer etc. but if the OS provides a means for referring to such modules independently then the modules may be considered separate modules and therefore separate power consuming components . Furthermore the above definition of power consuming components is not limited to modules with ON OFF states but may also include modules with multiple states where different states are likely to affect power consumption of the device differently e.g. a CPU may not have ON OFF states but the operating frequency may be used as a signal to correlate how the state of the CPU affects power consumption .

The power monitoring module may provide a list of existing power consuming components may determine what applications are running e.g. from the device s OS and or may provide power consumption information to the power awareness module for example.

The power awareness module may comprise suitable logic circuitry and or code that may be operable to determine power consumption and or related information of the data processing device while one or more of the applications are running on the data processing device . The power awareness module may communicate with the power monitoring module for determining the power consumption information. The power awareness module may utilize one or more counters for determining the power consumption information associated with a particular application such as the application . In this regard the one or more counters may correspond to one or more power consuming components under consideration respectively. In an example for every power consuming component the power awareness module may allocate storage for for example a usage counter for counting a number of applications using the particular power consuming component a state indicator e.g. ON or OFF and a power consumption counter e.g. the counters for each application using or in communication with the power awareness module .

In operation one or more of the applications may be running on the data processing device . Based on a communication from a particular application e.g. the power awareness module may be operable to provide to the particular application power consumption information of the data processing device associated with each of a plurality of application states of the particular application and or information related to the one or more power consuming components . The plurality of application states may comprise an application idle state and one or more application active states. The communication received from the particular application for the power consumption information and or for the information related to the one or more power consuming components may comprise invoking or implementing by the particular application one or more APIs associated with the power awareness module . The power awareness module may be operable to determine the provided power consumption information of the data processing device utilizing one or more counters associated with the particular application . The one or more counters may correspond to the one or more power consuming components respectively. In this regard the one or more counters may be reset based on the communication from the particular application . For example invoking by the particular application one specific API such as the API may cause the power awareness module to provide power consumption information of the data processing device as well as to reset the one or more counters .

In an example the particular application may compute or determine for each of the one or more application active states power consumption information of the particular application based on the provided power consumption information of the data processing device corresponding to the application idle state and to each of the one or more application active states. In such instances the particular application may determine whether the computed power consumption information of the particular application is within power consumption guidelines of the data processing device . In this regard based on the determination the particular application may generate an alert to a user of the data processing device for example. Based on the determination the particular application may also change application settings of the particular application for example.

In one example the provided information related to the one or more power consuming components may comprise component state information of a particular power consuming component in the data processing device a total number of one or more other applications such as the applications that at a specified time are using the particular power consuming component a current power source and or a current battery level indicating an amount of power remaining in the battery. In such instances the particular application may determine based on the provided information whether to perform or to defer an operation which may utilize the particular power consuming component for example.

In another example the communication from the particular application may comprise request information such as a request for notification when the one or more power consuming components in the data processing device become active or being turned ON and a time period that the particular application is willing to wait before using the one or more power consuming components . In such instances the power awareness module may be operable to track the request information received from the particular application along with other request information received from one or more other applications for using the one or more power consuming components . The power awareness module may be operable to determine based on the tracking a schedule for the particular application and for the one or more other applications to use the one or more power consuming components . The power awareness module may then be operable to provide based on the determined schedule a notification to the particular application to use the one or more power consuming components in the data processing device .

In an example operation when the application invokes a first specific API such as the API to register with the power awareness module the power awareness module may assign a handle to the application . The power awareness module may be operable to allocate one or more counters associated with the assigned handle of the application . When the application invokes a second specific API such as the API for obtaining power consumption information and or related information the power awareness module may retrieve power consumption information and or related information from the power monitoring module . The power awareness module may utilize the counters to track and record the power consumption information corresponding to the power consuming components under consideration respectively. Invoking of the API may also cause the power awareness module to reset the counters for subsequent usages.

In step the application may invoke a second specific API such as the API to cause the power awareness module to reset one or more of the counters associated with the handle of the application and to start tracking power consumption information for the application s handle. In step the application waits in an idle state for a time period e.g. a few seconds . The application may invoke again the second specific API to obtain power consumption information of the data processing device from the power awareness module while the application is in the application idle state. The power awareness API may return a measure of the accumulated power consumption during the period of time the application was idle. The application may store this measure as a baseline for a subsequent comparison. In this regard one of the units used for the power consumption information may be percent of battery capacity per day for instance. For example a value of 100 may indicate that a fully charged battery would last a time period e.g. one day at this power consumption rate. A value of 50 may indicate that a fully charged battery would last a different time period e.g. two days at this power consumption rate for example.

In step in instances when the application goes into an application active state e.g. transmitting data over a network the application may invoke the second specific API to cause the power awareness module to reset the one or more counters again and to start tracking power consumption information for the application s handle. In step the application may remain in active state for a given time period e.g. a few seconds . The application may invoke the second specific API to obtain power consumption information of the data processing device from the power awareness module while the application is in the application active state. In step the application may be operable to compute power consumption information of the application in the application active state based on obtained power consumption information of the data processing device corresponding to the application idle state and the application active state. For example the power awareness API may return a measure of the accumulated power consumption during the time period the application was in an active state. The application may use this information to compare against the baseline obtained in step and estimate the impact the application has on power consumption when in the active state. The example functions may proceed to the end step .

Referring to the example flow chart may start at when an application e.g. may invoke a first specific API e.g. API to inquire about the current state of a power consuming component e.g. wireless transceiver . At the application may receive the ON OFF state signal strength and number of other applications using the wireless transceiver at the time. At it may be determined whether the wireless transceiver is ON. If it is ON at data transmission may be performed. If it is OFF at the application e.g. may wait a predetermined period of time. At this point the loop may resume back at .

The example above considers only the ON OFF state of the wireless transceiver . However the disclosure may not be limited in this regard and many other examples may be envisioned where the application e.g. considers other pieces of information to make a power conscious decision of whether it should perform data transmission at a given time or whether it should defer it.

For example even if the wireless transceiver is ON the application may consider the signal strength of the wireless transceiver under the assumption that at low signal strengths the cost in terms of power consumption is higher than at high signal strengths.

The application e.g. may also keep track of the amount of time that has passed since it last used the wireless transceiver for data transmission and may decide to perform the data transmission even if the wireless transceiver is OFF. In this instance the priority for performing data transmission is effectively increasing over time.

The application e.g. may also consider the number of other applications using the wireless transceiver at a given time. If that number is high enough e.g. higher than a threshold number the application may estimate that its own use of the module does not make much of a difference at that time and then may decide to perform the data transmission.

The application e.g. may invoke the power awareness API e.g. to query for the current power source. For example it may determine that if the device is plugged in e.g. via a USB power source expensive operations in terms of power consumption may be allowed and it may decide to perform the data transmission.

The application e.g. may invoke the power awareness API e.g. to query for the current battery level amount of power remaining in the battery . At battery levels below a predetermined threshold the application may decide to defer the data transmission or increase the period of time between attempts to transmit data.

Additionally every time the application e.g. performs data transmission it may follow the procedure described in to keep track of the impact such data transmission is having on power consumption. It may also use that information on subsequent decisions of whether to perform data transmission or defer it.

At the application e.g. may invoke an API e.g. to start measuring power dissipation. In this regard the following functions may take place a retrieve accumulated power dissipation value from the power monitoring module and b store that value and the current time in the data area associated with the given application handle.

At the application e.g. may invoke an API e.g. to report power consumption. In this regard the following functions may take place a retrieve accumulated power dissipation value from the power monitoring module b compare e.g. by subtraction the retrieved accumulated power dissipation value and the retrieved value in step above current value for handle minus start value for handle to determine the power dissipation of the device between the start and current times c store the accumulated power dissipation from step a. above and the current time in the data area associated with the handle and d return the computed value in step b. above and the current time.

At the OS may change the state of a power consuming component M e.g. the change may occur as a side effect of an application call or from the hardware itself e.g. user turns off the ringer with a switch . The power awareness module may then be instructed to record the state for component M.

At an application e.g. X may invoke start or report. In this regard the following functions may be performed a query power monitoring module for a list of power consuming components i.e. the counters from step b for each power consuming component in consideration M the following may be performed b.1 for each application using the power awareness module b.1.1 subtract the application per component counter e.g. counter for M from the global counter for that component. Save the value for return to the application and b.1.2 set the application per component counter e.g. counter to the current global value for M and c return the total dissipation the vector of result values from step b.1.1 and the vector module states to the application.

In step the application may determine whether to perform or to defer an operation which may utilize the power consuming component based on the information provided by the power awareness module . In this regard for example the application may invoke the API to inquire about the current state of the wireless transceiver for WiFi communication. The application may be provided with the ON OFF state signal strength and the number of other applications that are using the wireless transceiver at the specified time. In instances when the wireless transceiver for the WiFi communication is ON the application may perform the data transmission via the wireless transceiver . In instance when the wireless transceiver for the WiFi communication is OFF the application may wait for a determined period of time for example. In other instances even if the wireless transceiver is ON the application may consider the signal strength of the wireless transceiver .

The application may keep track of the amount of time that has passed since the application last used the wireless transceiver for data transmission and may decide to perform the data transmission anyway even if the wireless transceiver is at low signal strength for example. The application may consider the number of other applications that are using the wireless transceiver at the specified time. In instances when that number is high enough the application may estimate that its usage of the wireless transceiver may not make much of a difference at that time and may decide to perform the data transmission for example. In some instances the application may determine that if the power source is a plugged in power source such as for example an USB power source the application may decide to perform the data transmission for example. At battery levels which may be below a determined threshold the application may decide to defer the data transmission or to increase the period of time between attempts to transmit data for example. The example functions may proceed to the end step .

In step the application may receive based on a schedule determined by the power awareness module a notification from the power awareness module to use the one or more power consuming components . In this regard the power awareness module may be operable to track the request for notification from the application along with other requests from one or more other applications for using the one or more power consuming components . The power awareness module may also track environmental conditions e.g. signal strength battery level power source for example. The power awareness module may determine based on the tracking a schedule for the different applications to use the one or more power consuming components . In this regard the power awareness module may use heuristics to compute the schedule for example. The example functions may proceed to the end step .

In a first example scenario each of the applications requests a notification when the one or more power consuming components become active. When the application registers for notification at T 1 minutes the power awareness module may decide that 3 applications are enough to justify turning on the power consuming component . The power awareness module may immediately turn on the power consuming component record that the applications are using the power consuming component notify all the three applications and cancel the notification requests. The applications use the power consuming component and when each of the applications finishes use of the power consuming component each of the applications may indicate this to the power awareness module . When the application registers to receive notification for the power consuming component at T 2 minutes the power awareness module may turn on the power consuming component and notify the applications and

In a second example scenario the application may need simultaneous use of the power consuming components and . In such instances each of the applications requests a notification when the one or more power consuming components become active. The applications may also set times to trigger the power awareness module in instances when their waiting deadlines occur. For example the waiting time of the application expires at T 4 minutes. The application may direct the power awareness module to turn on the power consuming component at T 4 minutes . The power awareness module may turn on the power consuming component record that applications are using the power consuming component notify all the three applications that the power consuming component is available and cancel their notification requests. The applications and make use of the power consuming component

The application may not use the power consuming component until the power consuming component becomes available. Accordingly the application may direct the power awareness module to turn on the power consuming component . The power awareness module may turn on the power consuming component record that the applications and are using the power consuming component notify the applications and cancel their notification requests. When the application is done with using the power consuming components and the application may indicate this to the power awareness module and the power awareness module may turn off the power consuming component for example. When the application is done with using the power consuming component the application may indicate this to the power awareness module and the power awareness module may turn off the power consuming component for example.

In a third example scenario each of the applications requests a notification when the one or more power consuming components become active. The power awareness module may determine that at T 4 minutes it would be a good time for the power consuming components and to be turned on. Accordingly the power awareness module may turn on the power consuming components and at T 4 minutes record that the applications are using the power consuming component and the applications are using the power consuming components notify the applications to proceed as shown by the trigger notification arrow in and cancel their notification requests. The applications make use of the power consuming components and concurrently. When each of the applications is done with using the power consuming component and or the power consuming component each of the applications may indicate this to the power awareness module . In this regard when the power awareness module determines that the last application has stopped using a power consuming component the power awareness module may turn that power consuming component off.

In the fourth example scenario assuming for example that each of the applications may use a power consuming component for 10 seconds and that an overhead of concurrent use of a power consuming component is negligible i.e. the applications may all use the power consuming components during the same 10 seconds and get their works done the power consuming component may only be turned on for a total of 10 seconds at T 4 minutes to be used by the applications . However without the notification to use the power consuming components at T 4 minutes the power consuming component may be turned on at T 0 minutes for 10 seconds again at T 1 minutes for 10 seconds and again at T 2 minutes for 10 seconds for example. Thus without the notification the power consuming component would have been in an ON state for 30 seconds as opposed to 10 seconds with the notification.
