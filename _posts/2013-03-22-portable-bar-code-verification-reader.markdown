The present application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 61 614 707 filed Mar. 23 2012 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety as if fully set forth herein.

This invention relates generally to bar code verification technology and in particular to a method and apparatus for capturing any size bar code both one dimensional and two dimensional bar codes by using a hand held portable device in one embodiment. In one embodiment the bar codes may be specifically designed to follow industry standards for bar code verification conformance such as ISO IEC 15426 1 2006 E and ISO IEC 15426 2 2005 E .

In one embodiment the invention may also be designed to snap into a special platform that can be attached to a table top printer or the like and verify the quality of bar code labels as they are being printed.

The prior art teaches the use of a video camera a lens and a light source combination placed into large enclosures. Portable devices have previously not been possible to make since many bar code labels are greater than 5 wide. This size field of view requires the distance between the lens and the bar code label to be significantly large. Therefore any portable device would have a large footprint and it would be very difficult to verify labels efficiently with such a configuration. An area camera with a single lens cannot capture both small and large bar code labels without changing the camera and or the lens.

Another prior art device uses a line scan video camera a lens and a light source combination placed into a small enclosure. But the process of bar code verification with such a device requires the user to scan 10 different positions across a one dimensional bar code in order to verify the bar code according to industry standards. This is a very slow process and does not account for any of the scans that might pick up a smear or blemish. A line scan camera system alone cannot read a line of bar code data that does not decode. A line scan camera s ability to accurately verify a bar code depends upon a subjective position across the image and a line scan camera bar code verification system alone cannot decode or verify any two dimensional codes as it lacks vertical resolution.

Bar codes are used in a wide range of applications. But when a bar code label does not read or does not read the correct data an avalanche of errors can and will occur causing inventory control issues as well as potentially incorrect pricing. Thus major retail outlet will penalize the printer with a stiff monetary fine for each and every bar code label that did not work properly.

Bar code verification systems are essential in today s world. Today many printing companies spot check for bar code quality as a bar code is being printed. Since portable 1D and 2D bar code verification systems do not exist the printing companies often have to take individual samples of bar code labels from their production line and carry them into their quality inspection rooms then grade the quality of a bar code label. A portable verification device as described below according to the teachings of the present invention would allow them to check bar code quality right on the production line resulting in a valuable savings of time and effort.

In one embodiment of the present invention the user can pull the read head of a portable bar code verification device across a bar code label by using the attached handle. Alternatively the read head can be snapped into a docking station mounted onto for example a printer so that bar code labels can be verified dynamically while the labels are being printed.

While prior art verifiers are limited to grading bar code labels that will fit into their field of view which is equivalent to the size of their imaging sensor with the present invention the width of the bar code does not matter. All labels can be scanned down the image vertically or across the image horizontally making the size of a bar code label generally irrelevant.

In one embodiment of the present invention a contact image sensor integrated with a for example 660 nm red light source may be used in conjunction with an encoder and a strategically placed stabilization roller. This invention will capture the image of any type and any physical size label one dimensional and two dimensional and may send the data to a computer. Multiple barcodes may be captured as well. The present invention may read bar codes of varying sizes such as a bar code label as small as 0.25 or even smaller and as large as 12 inches wide or larger .

The floating head feature allows the user to scan across an uneven surface for instance corrugated cardboard and still be able to effectively collect the video image. This feature acts similar to an old record player that uses a floating needle and cartridge. The floating head feature allows the user to scan a bar code label without damaging the surface of the bar code label and allows the user to scan across sharp object without destroying the sensor.

The CIS may use a flat window element c to protect the sensor s electronics. This flat surface acts to stabilize the depth of focus. The flat surface also may help to create a 45 degree illumination angle from the internal LED s to the label surface as stipulated in for example ISO IEC 15426 1 2006 E and ISO IEC 15426 2 2005 E industry standards for bar code verification conformance standard s geometrical arrangement for a light source with respect to the imaging device.

On each side of the CIS may be two alignment pins elements d . These pins stabilize the up and down motion of the floating CIS head and also help stabilize the front to back tilt of the CIS head.

To each side of the CIS head may be end plates elements e . The end plates are designed to hold the pins elements d in place and allow for vertical movement of the CIS while minimizing horizontal movement.

The end plates elements e are designed to be removed so that the CIS head can easily be replaced and are designed to rest onto the surface of the bar code label being examined. The bottom of these end plates set the maximum surface position of the CIS head.

The end plates elements e may in one embodiment be made of polytetrafluorethylene or similar material so that the surface friction is minimal.

The end plates elements e act as two legs of a triangular support for the entire reader. They may be positioned 0.050 below the main body of the read head. .

In one embodiment a stabilization roller may be used element f and may be located near the rear of the reader. The stabilization roller may be made of a semi rigid rubber. When the roller contacts the surface of a bar code it creates a unique stabilization of the scanning motion. It may be geometrically arranged in a triangular pattern with the two end plates element e . When scanning a bar code it may be important to control swaying or shifting motions. Without the stabilization roller the collected image may become terminally distorted.

In one embodiment the stabilization roller along with the two end plates elements e and CIS are the only parts of the read head structure that make contact with the surface.

The stabilization roller may be positioned 0.050 below the main body of the read head and may use two bearings elements g located on each side of the read head. The stabilization roller may also be connected to an encoder element h .

The encoder element h is a device that creates electric pulses that represent forward or reverse motion. For a 400 pixels per inch Contact Image Sensor CIS the encoder may be required in one embodiment to output 400 pulses per inch. In this way the CIS can be programmed to scan 400 times per inch. The results will cause a linear image to be created.

In various embodiment the encoder is attached to the stabilization roller at one end and there is a handle element i located on top of the read head. The handle may be geometrically positioned to exert pressure equally between the stabilization roller and the end plates. The bottom base of the read head element j may be recessed by 0.100 from the surface of a bar code label. It may also be beveled on each side to minimize contact with potentially raised edges of die cut bar code labels. The upper housing element k may be used to cover the mechanical structure and the upper housing holds the handle element i .

In further embodiments the upper housing element k has an orifice element l which allows the Grade Quality LED Indicator element n located on the main electronic circuit board element m to be seen by the user. All processing for creating a video image may be performed on the main electronic circuit board element m located inside the read head or may be performed in a variety of other ways.

In further embodiments the entire hand held structure may also be placed onto a special platform that is mounted to a printer so that bar code verification can be performed dynamically as the bar code labels are being printed. When necessary the hand held structure can be removed and used statically to grade bar codes. The removal and mounting of the device may also use a snap in place structure so it is easy to grade the quality of bar code labels both statically or dynamically.

In different embodiments the hand held verification reader of the present invention may have a dedicated computer inside to give the user more verification data. The hand held verification reader of the present invention may use a SIM card to save images to be downloaded later for additional verification analysis. Further the hand held verification reader of the present invention may use a memory stick thumb drive to save images to be downloaded later for additional verification analysis.

In various embodiments the hand held verification reader of the present invention may incorporate a monitor that displays additional verification data. The hand held verification reader of the present invention may also transmit video data via the Internet Wi Fi Bluetooth or another communication medium to a local PC for further verification analysis and data storage.

In further embodiments the hand held verification reader of the present invention may be used to read and qualify Braille according to industry standards

In one embodiment the hand held verification reader of the present invention may incorporate a battery pack for portable verification.

The electronic architecture of the present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the block diagrams of as well as the flow diagram of . The invention provides an electronic architecture for image acquisition which is suitable for barcode verification. Specifically the present invention may process the analog video signal of a contact image sensor and format the data for for example USB 2.0 or 3.0 isochronous transfer. In one embodiment of the invention the resulting USB video data may be made available for a Windows PC running the Lumenera Corporation USB drivers for Windows. In another embodiment of the invention the resulting USB video data is made available for a PC running the GNU USB driver libusb in a Windows operating system.

In one embodiment of the present invention with reference to the image acquisition process is driven by a line scan camera circuit board designed and manufactured by the Lumenera Corporation. The Lumenera camera board interfaces directly to a contact image sensor CIS and to a second circuit board designed by Label Vision Systems encoder driver circuit board which relays positional information to the Lumenera camera board by processing the quadrature pulses of an incremental encoder .

The resolution of the CIS may in one embodiment be high enough to follow industry standards for bar code verification. For example a 400 ppi sensor is qualified to read one dimensional code as small as 7 mils dim and a two dimensional code as small as 12 mil dim.

As shown in and the flow diagram of an FPGA in the Lumenera camera board may drive the entire image acquisition logic. In one embodiment the FPGA clocks the contact image sensor CIS up to a maximum frequency of 4800 lines per second the LEDs in the CIS are turned on while a line is being scanned and remain off when idle step . In step the resulting analog video output is passed to an analog to digital converter ADC which presents the digital data to the FPGA . In step the FPGA stores the digital data in memory and subsequently passes it to the USB controller for USB transfer. In step on the receiving end an application running the Lumenera Corporation USB drivers and library can process the data as streaming video. In one embodiment the converted digital image is processed against the Symbology Specification to determine the code and decodes it for processing against the requirements as defined in ISO 15415 or 15416.

The FPGA can activate the general purpose I O s GPIO and adjust the gain in the ADC at any given time in response to a command given to the FPGA by the PC application at . These commands are described in the Lumenera s API Application Programming Interface . In step the GPIO s are used to activate the LED indicator and to control the encoder polarity. The quadrature encoder pulses are processed and sampled by a microcontroller in the circuit board. They are then relayed to the Lumenera camera board and used to clock the CIS .

In one embodiment of the present invention with reference to two microprocessors and run the image acquisition logic. One microprocessor controls the interface to the encoder and CIS while the other microprocessor processes the video data and sends it to a Windows PC over USB protocol.

One microprocessor processes the encoder signals for motion control and respectively clocks the CIS and accompanying LEDs . This microprocessor also provides the control signals to the ADC and the write clock for the FIFO . A second microprocessor provides the read clock to the FIFO collects the digital data and processes it for asynchronous USB transmission using the built in USB host controller. This processor also controls the LED indicator in response to commands sent by the PC application at which communicates to the camera board via the GNU USB driver libusb. Through this interface the PC application at also sends commands to control the gain in the ADC and sets up the encoder polarity.

The present invention has the option to be powered via USB power by an external power supply or any other suitable source.

The present invention has been described above with respect to various embodiments both in hardware and in software. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that these are just sample embodiments and that other suitable embodiments may also be used.
