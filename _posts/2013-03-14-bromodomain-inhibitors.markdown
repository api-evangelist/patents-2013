This present application is a continuation of International PCT Application No. PCT CN2012 086357 filed on Dec. 11 2012 which claims the benefit of priority to International PCT Application No. PCT CN2011 002224 filed on Dec. 30 2011 the teachings of which are each herein incorporated by reference in their entirety

Bromodomains refer to conserved protein structural folds which bind to N acetylated lysine residues that are found in some proteins. The BET family of bromodomain containing proteins is comprised of four members BRD2 BRD3 BRD4 and BRDt . Each member of the BET family employs two bromodomains to recognize N acetylated lysine residues found primarily but not exclusively on the amino terminal tails of histone proteins. These interactions modulate gene expression by recruiting transcription factors to specific genome locations within chromatin. For example histone bound BRD4 recruits the transcription factor P TEFb to promoters resulting in the expression of a subset of genes involved in cell cycle progression Yang et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 28 967 976 2008 . BRD2 and BRD3 also function as transcriptional regulators of growth promoting genes LeRoy et al. Mol. Cell 30 51 60 2008 . BET family members were recently established as being important for the maintenance of several cancer types Zuber et al. Nature 478 524 528 2011 Mertz et al Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci. 108 16669 16674 2011 Delmore et al. Cell 146 1 14 2011 Dawson et al. Nature 478 529 533 2011 . BET family members have also been implicated in mediating acute inflammatory responses through the canonical NF KB pathway Huang et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 29 1375 1387 2009 resulting in the upregulation of genes associated with the production of cytokines Nicodeme et al. Nature 468 1119 1123 2010 . In addition bromodomain function has been implicated in kidney disease Zhang et al. J. Biol. Chem. 287 28840 28851 2012 . BRD2 function has also been linked to a predisposition for dyslipidemia or improper regulation of adipogenesis elevated inflammatory profiles and increased susceptibility to autoimmune diseases Denis Discovery Medicine 10 489 499 2010 . The human immunodeficiency virus utilizes BRD4 to initiate transcription of viral RNA from stably integrated viral DNA Jang et al. Mol. Cell 19 523 534 2005 . BET bromodomain inhibitors have also been shown to reactivate HIV transcription in models of latent T cell infection and latent monocyte infection Banerjee et al J. Leukocyte Biol. doi 10.1189 jlb.0312165 . BRDt has an important role in spermatogenesis Matzuk et al. Cell 150 673 684 2012 . Accordingly there is an ongoing medical need to develop new drugs to treat diseases and indications involving bromodomain function including BET bromodomain function.

If a moiety is described as substituted a non hydrogen radical is in the place of hydrogen radical of any substitutable atom of the moiety. Thus for example a substituted heterocycle moiety is a heterocycle moiety in which at least one non hydrogen radical is in the place of a hydrogen radical on the heterocycle. It should be recognized that if there are more than one substitution on a moiety each non hydrogen radical may be identical or different unless otherwise stated .

If a moiety is described as being optionally substituted the moiety may be either 1 not substituted or 2 substituted. If a moiety is described as being optionally substituted with up to a particular number of non hydrogen radicals that moiety may be either 1 not substituted or 2 substituted by up to that particular number of non hydrogen radicals or by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the moiety whichever is less. Thus for example if a moiety is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non hydrogen radicals then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non hydrogen radicals as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. To illustrate tetrazolyl which has only one substitutable position would be optionally substituted with up to one non hydrogen radical. To illustrate further if an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non hydrogen radicals then a primary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non hydrogen radicals whereas a secondary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to only 1 non hydrogen radical.

This invention also provides for pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier diluent or excipient therefor. The phrase pharmaceutical composition refers to a composition suitable for administration in medical or veterinary use.

The pharmaceutical compositions that comprise a compound of formula I alone or or in combination with a second active pharmaceutical agent may be administered to the subjects orally rectally parenterally intracisternally intravaginally intraperitoneally topically as by powders ointments or drops bucally or as an oral or nasal spray. The term parenterally as used herein refers to modes of administration which include intravenous intramuscular intraperitoneal intrasternal subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion.

The term pharmaceutically acceptable carrier as used herein means a non toxic inert solid semi solid or liquid filler diluent encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as but not limited to lactose glucose and sucrose starches such as but not limited to corn starch and potato starch cellulose and its derivatives such as but not limited to sodium carboxymethyl cellulose ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate powdered tragacanth malt gelatin talc excipients such as but not limited to cocoa butter and suppository waxes oils such as but not limited to peanut oil cottonseed oil safflower oil sesame oil olive oil corn oil and soybean oil glycols such a propylene glycol esters such as but not limited to ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate agar buffering agents such as but not limited to magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide alginic acid pyrogen free water isotonic saline Ringer s solution ethyl alcohol and phosphate buffer solutions as well as other non toxic compatible lubricants such as but not limited to sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate as well as coloring agents releasing agents coating agents sweetening flavoring and perfuming agents preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition according to the judgment of the formulator.
