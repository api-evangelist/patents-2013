This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 499 672 filed Jul. 8 2009 entitled Effects Application Based on Object Clustering and claims the benefit of the U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 193 853 filed on Dec. 30 2008 which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.

The present invention relates generally to the field of media presentations and in particular to authoring rendering viewing exporting and sharing media effects.

Current media presentation applications offer features for creating slides and manually customizing the ways in which a set of slides i.e. a slideshow media presentation is played. Such applications also offer features for attaching themes to slideshows where such themes may affect the appearance and general behavior of the slideshows when played. In addition such applications further offer features such as customizing slide colors customizing transition behavior customizing transition delay and manually adding clip art image audio video files to one or more slides in a slideshow. These applications also permit basic sequential transition forward or backward and from one slide to another in a slideshow containing more than one slide. A user may customize the time that one slide should be viewed prior to the application invoking a transition to another slide which may further have a custom viewing time associated with it as well. However current media presentations applications do not provide a feature for authoring media effects comprising accessing media content analyzing the media content according to meta data media characteristics or other media related data and creating a media content object cluster according to the meta data the media characteristics or the other media related data. Moreover current media presentation applications also do not provide a feature for dynamically profiling a slideshow soundtrack based on various criteria like beats per minute BPM rhythmic strength RS harmonic complexity HC and or root mean square density RMS or RMS strength . Such criteria when profiled intelligently may be further used to select appropriate effects and assemble such effects in useful ways applicable to a slideshow. Further such effects could be customized according to durations in out points and transitions in sync with audio alone or the audio of a video. Finally current media presentation applications do not provide features for automatic as well as user defined authoring rendering exporting and sharing media presentations slideshows in an easily integrated modern platform.

Accordingly the present invention is directed to a system and method for authoring rendering exporting and sharing media effects that substantially obviates one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.

An embodiment of the present invention provides a computer implemented method for authoring media effects comprising accessing media content analyzing the media content according to meta data media characteristics or other media related data and creating a media content object cluster according to the meta data the media characteristics or the other media related data.

Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows and in part will be apparent from the description or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.

To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention as embodied and broadly described a system comprises one or more processors memory one or more programs stored in memory the one or more programs comprising instructions to access media content analyze the media content according to meta data media characteristics or other media related data and create a media content object cluster according to the meta data the media characteristics or the other media related data.

In another aspect a computer readable storage medium stores one or more programs configured for execution by a computer the one or more programs comprising instructions to access media content analyze the media content according to meta data media characteristics or other media related data and create a media content object cluster according to the meta data the media characteristics or the other media related data.

It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.

Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description numerous non limiting specific details are set forth in order to assist in understanding the subject matter presented herein. It will be apparent however to one of ordinary skill in the art that various alternatives may be used without departing from the scope of the present invention and the subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. For example it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the subject matter presented herein can be implemented on any type of standalone system or client server compatible system containing any type of client network server and database elements.

In some embodiments the exemplary embodiment of an application and its features components may be implemented by one or more modules engines reference numerals executed using an exemplary system with a central processing unit CPU and alternatively multiple CPUs memory for storing data e.g. instructions from an operating system or one or more programs e.g. to be fetched by the CPU for execution a display device for displaying the exemplary application using a graphics module to a display screen a network interface card NIC for sending and receiving data over a wired or wireless communications network local storage for storing media content and other data e.g. an operating system the exemplary embodiment of an application other applications etc. and auxiliary device s component s e.g. TV or other display portable storage portable media player etc. which may all be connected via a bus for sending and receiving data according to a frequency e.g. synchronous or asynchronous .

In some embodiments the features components of the application may be described as follows. The document also reference numeral is the top level object of the media presentation slideshow that may be created e.g. steps using the exemplary application . The document is the object that may comprise all of the custom default layers also reference numeral e.g. steps effect containers such as for example those within the effect containers region also reference numeral effects such as for example those within the effect containers also reference numeral gaps or transitions for separating or linking effects respectively also reference numeral slides such as for example the images of or other media content as described above also reference numeral e.g. step frames a document layer effect stack a layer effect slide filter stack a playlist an animation path a song a keyframe which may for example be one dimensional 1D two dimensional 2D or a vector filters a layer effect container effect slide filter stack and any other possible combination of the aforementioned. Moreover a document may contain layers that may be stacked placed one on top of another to provide the media presentation slideshow with an added level of flexibility in what is available for actual display e.g. steps . Accordingly the application supports the presentation of less than all of the available layers. Stacking may involve a process for example of logically associating or linking layers. That is a background layer may be considered the lowest level layer in a stack of layers followed by a foreground layer and a plurality of other foreground layers all of which would be logically associated according to their position from for example background layer or from each other foreground layer. During display play of a document such as for example document the layers would be displayed played according to their respective positions in the stack logical associations . The next feature component is the layers background foreground also reference numeral within a document also reference numeral e.g. steps . Each layer of a stack of layers e.g. aggregated layers steps within a document can be positioned sized and rotated using the exemplary application . Further each layer may also have a custom audio file track or alternatively a set of audio files tracks or other media content associated with it and other layers thus providing a media presentation slideshow with multiple audio files tracks during presentation e.g. steps . Each layer may also contain effect containers like for example those illustrated in the effect containers region e.g. steps which may be linked together in a layer using transitions also reference numeral or separated from one another using gaps or alternatively some other effect separation variable like for example random separation transition or a combination of gaps and transitions etc. e.g. . Transitions which through visual action expression may create the appearance that two effect containers are linked together may be able to provide a rather fluid or alternatively a non fluid experience between effect containers when presenting a media presentation slideshow. For example transitions may be the visual action expression of a page flipping a slide dissolving a slide being pushed along in any direction a cube breaking apart or being assembled a page rolling for the purpose of unveiling hiding contents a puzzle being assembled or disassembled or any other type of visual action expression applied to an effect container or slide and capable of being rendered on a display device. Slides in the exemplary application may be the actual image movie text or other media content that may be within an effect which may be within an effect container e.g. steps . Slides may have frames applied as an added layer e.g. on top where a frame may be a visual element expression such as for example making an image appear as if it was taken using an instant photo camera e.g. Polaroid is part of a filmstrip has a solid dashed shadowed other border surrounding it or other type of frame related visual element expression. Further each slide may have an animation path that may determine which part of a slide image movie text or other media content is actually displayed played similarly an animation path associated with the slide may cause a panning zooming effect to be executed on the image movie text or other media content where the panning zooming may occur within the effect of the slide. As applied to a layer a user may also customize an animation path via the exemplary application to for example smoothly transition a layer s rotation from around zero 0 degrees all the way to three hundred sixty 360 degrees over a default or custom period of time e.g. steps . In some embodiments transitions may have durations associated with them to determine how long the transitions are played. The transition duration may be subtracted directly from the total duration of the effect containers separated divided by the transition. For example when transitioning from an effect container with a three 3 second duration to another effect container with a three 3 second duration that is having a six 6 second total duration using a transition with a one 1 second duration the effect containers may only be played for a total of five 5 seconds i.e. the total six 6 second duration of the effect containers minus the one 1 second transition display play duration leaves five 5 seconds of display play duration for the effect containers .

In some embodiments effect containers may be able to determine the order that images or alternatively other media content associated with a layer e.g. steps are presented during a media presentation slideshow. Such a determination may be based according to characteristics associated with the images or alternatively other media content e.g. steps . The characteristics may comprise a resolution size quality indicator dots per inch frames per second window size bit error rate BER compression type or some other media content characteristic. The exemplary application may execute this process of assembling the layers e.g. steps either manually or according to algorithms processing the characteristics and other layer related data described above . Further with respect to effect containers e.g. a container or group of effects multiple effects may be transitioned as one set into the next effect container. For example effect containers are necessary in order for different text to be displayed on top of different effects. In some embodiments from an implementation viewpoint the effect containers permit the logical physical grouping of different effects and link each of the effects to their respective different text which is to be displayed on top of each respective effect. Each effect container may for example further contain a variable for storing a specific duration for determining how long each of the effects associated with an effect container or alternatively within the effect container are displayed played.

In some embodiments a keyframe which may for example be one dimensional 1D two dimensional 2D or a vector may be used by an animation path to guide or instruct the rate at which animation path should operate. Meaning the higher the value of a keyframe the increased rate the animation path may operate e.g. a faster pan zoom effect or a faster layer rotation and the lower the value of a keyframe the lower rate the animation path may operate at e.g. a slower pan zoom effect or a slower layer rotation . A 1D keyframe may be a keyframe that animates a property that has one value like for example a rotation angle. A 2D keyframe may be a keyframe that animates a property that has more than one value like for example a position x axis point y axis point or a size width length height . And a vector keyframe may be a keyframe that animates a property that has more than two values like for example colors that manipulate the different values of their constituent color components e.g. red green blue alpha .

In some embodiments filters operate as visual elements that are applied to a layer effect container effect or slide. A filter may be for example a shadow blurred image or some other compatible visual element capable of being applied to a layer effect container effect or slide e.g. steps .

In some embodiments a playlist associated with a document may contain a list of songs e.g. steps . The playlist may organize songs such that they are played in a specific order determined manually by a user of the exemplary application or automatically through the exemplary application . An automatic playlist may be created according to song genre file characteristics e.g. type size date etc. or according to the feature for dynamically profiling a slideshow soundtrack based on various criteria like beats per minute BPM rhythmic strength RS harmonic complexity HC and or root mean square density RMS or RMS strength . The songs e.g. a reference to a playlist may be stored in digital format in local storage or on an auxiliary device component that communicates with the system through a communications protocol or standard. The songs may be stored in a single file or other logical physical data aggregator or many files. In addition to songs a playlist may contain other compatible media content like videos with audio content which for example may be parsed from the video file into an individual song audio file or playlist . To associate a playlist song audio file or any compatible media content with a document the user may select it them from the select media content menu and drag the respective playlist song audio file or other compatible media content via the exemplary application into the effect containers region see for example the reference to Drag Audio Here in the exemplary application e.g. steps . Songs may be played in the background while a document is being displayed played or they may alternatively be associated with foreground layers or effects that may be organized on top of another thus enabling the songs to be switched in coordination with the various switching e.g. via gaps or transitions from one layer or effect to another e.g. steps . Further songs may according to a default setting start and stop playing based on the start and stop times that may be given from a media player or media management application. The user of the exemplary application may however define a custom start or stop time via a song or playlist menu option of the application .

In some embodiments the core module may be considered the low level data structure module and it may for example perform routines for representing how a slideshow media presentation document is constructed and contain the necessary information for accurately representing a slideshow media presentation document according to features many of which are described herein e.g. steps . Some of those features may include for example features related to timing e.g. gaps transitions positioning e.g. background layer foreground layer effects of effect containers slides filters text sizing e.g. keyframe animation path as well as their interaction and files e.g. songs playlists .

In some embodiments the producer may be considered the module for creating how a slideshow will look and feel e.g. steps performing several analyses related to media content e.g. images audio video of layers effect containers effects and slides e.g. step and automatically assembling slideshows media presentations according to data that may result from the analyses e.g. steps . The several analyses e.g. step may include analysis of characteristics related to layers effect containers effects and slides. Such characteristics may include for example layer type e.g. background foreground layer number e.g. position in relation to the background most layer number of effect containers length of gaps and transitions type of transitions type of effects number of effects number of slides type of slides document length user preferences e.g. for ordering layers effect containers effects slides audio analyses video analyses or other similar characteristics. After performing the several analyses using for example the producer the resulting data from the several analyses may be processed by the producer the core the renderer the exporter or other module e.g. step . The producer may for example interface with and utilize the application programming interfaces API of frameworks like for example browsers or QuickTime to gather such information as thumbnail data and resolutions for images as well as audio or video durations or other characteristics. The gathered information may then be processed by the producer in accordance with one or more general specific algorithms or other analytical methods and then used by the producer or other module with which the producer may call for example to automatically assemble a slideshow or media presentation document e.g. . The producer may further for example assemble a document via core for play display using the features of renderer by accessing photos and coupling such photos with a style e.g. see description of . In addition the producer may also for example perform audio analysis functions on songs or a set of songs playlist using such analysis like for example beat detection mapping. The producer may also keep track of available styles e.g. effects transitions and frames .

In some embodiments the renderer may be considered the play display module. The renderer may receive slideshow media presentation data from for example the core and producer and may render such data such that it may be sent to a graphics card or other display device or interface e.g. . The renderer may interface with QuickTime media player e.g. the framework of QuickTime media player or another compatible application or framework for audio video decoding. In addition the renderer may also interface with a composer type application for actual rendering e.g. of the slides and the same or another similar application for applying filters .

In some embodiments the exporter may be considered the sharing module. The exporter may for example use renderer to export the slideshow media presentation document to different formats e.g. file formats like those supported by QuickTime or other similar applications. The exporter may for example obtain movie frame type data from renderer and add it to a movie type file. When the exporter is finished retrieving data for each movie the slideshow media presentation document would be available for access and sharing through the exemplary application or other applications that may access or handle the document in its final format.

In some embodiments in steps the producer or other framework module may analyze the media content through meta data by accessing file characteristics encoded data tags XML data or by accessing media characteristics e.g. camera capture device make model or other media related data. For example meta data may be one or more of a time associated with the media content s creation a rating associated with the media content individually or in the aggregate keywords associated with the media content comments associated with the media content a country state province city associated with the media content a longitude latitude associated with the media content or some other readable or extrapolated data.

In some embodiments the producer or other framework module may further analyze the gathered meta data like that described above by comparing and contrasting the similarities and difference that may be prevalent among the meta data while tracking which meta data is associated with which media content. For example the analysis may involve comparing and contrasting the date time associated with the media content textual similarities associated with the media content the places where media content originated or was generated a rating associated with the media content or an order e.g. chronology associated with the media content. According to the results of such analyses the producer or other framework module may create media content object clusters e.g. steps A or more specifically for example slide clusters e.g. A where the results indicate that one or more media content types may be related e.g. A A . Slide clusters may be considered a collection of slides that may be logically grouped according to predefined criteria where the criteria may vary and be defined according to media presentation slideshow styles or properties. For example media content object clusters may be created for media content types where the clusters are time order based e.g. reference numeral A location based keyword based e.g. reference numeral A people based camera based rating based e.g. reference numeral A or according to some other readable or extractable logical grouping e.g. steps reference numeral A see description for . Moreover based on the analyses a link strength e.g. having a value from one 1 to ten 10 may be associated with a cluster in order to indicate how likely the cluster may be useful to the user based on how related the media content associated with such a cluster may be. For example a slide cluster with a link strength value of seven 7 indicates that the media content associated with the cluster is more likely to be closely related than that of a slide cluster with a link strength of two 2 . If the media content has no meta data media characteristics or other media related data that the producer or other framework module may analyze then a slide cluster with a link strength of one 1 may be created and the media content may be sorted chronologically if possible or alternatively in a random order.

In some embodiments slide clusters where media content is sorted chronologically may be used for a media presentation slideshow document e.g. step where for example the purpose is to tell a story. Further slide clusters where media content is sorted according to a keyword burst rate rating or date time etc. may be used for a media presentation where for example the purpose is to illustrate a portfolio of media content e.g. a set of sequential time based images of a wind surfer such as that illustrated in reference numerals or alternatively a collection of images of flowers or a specific location such as that illustrated in reference numerals .

It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.
