The present technology pertains to shared content and more specifically pertains to providing information about shared content.

Online content storage is becoming more popular. People frequently store access or otherwise interact with content stored at online content management systems. Documents pictures music videos directories folders and other types of content items can be stored at online content management systems to be accessed by users of the online content management systems. In some cases a content item can be shared by one user with another user s via an online content management system.

For example a first entity can store a collection s of content items e.g. a directory ies a document s within a directory ies a photo album a media playlist files data etc. at the first entity s account with an online content management system. In other words the first entity can be the owner of the collection s of content items. In one example the first entity i.e. owner can decide to share a content item with one or more other entities also known as recipients via the online content management system. In this example the first entity can also be known as a sharer of the content item. The recipients can choose whether or not to accept the sharing of the content item. In some cases if the recipients accept the sharing of the content item then the recipients can download the content item via the online content management system and the content item can be synced among the sharer e.g. owner account and the recipient accounts. As such if any one of the sharer and or the recipients modifies the shared content item then the modification s made to the shared content item will be updated i.e. reflected take place etc. at each of the sharer account and or the recipient accounts.

In some cases a recipient may have a difficult time deciding whether or not to accept shared content. For example the recipient might not know much about the content item e.g. a directory and or other sub level content items within the content item e.g. files within the directory . The content item might not be sufficiently relevant with respect to the recipient s perspective. In another example the recipient might not know whether accepting and thus downloading the shared content would use up too much memory e.g. storage space hard disk space etc. at the recipient s online content management system account and or computing device. These and other concerns can create challenges for the overall user experience associated with sharing content via online content management systems.

Additional features and advantages of the disclosure will be set forth in the description which follows and in part will be obvious from the description or can be learned by practice of the herein disclosed principles. The features and advantages of the disclosure can be realized and obtained by means of the instruments and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. These and other features of the disclosure will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims or can be learned by the practice of the principles set forth herein.

Disclosed are systems methods and non transitory computer readable storage media for providing information about content shared via an online content management system. In some embodiments a user of the online content management system can store data such as collections of content items e.g. directories files albums playlists etc. at the online content management system. The user can be considered the owner of the collections of content items. The owner can share one or more of his content items with one or more other users such that the content items can be synced among the owner and the other users with whom the content items are shared. In this case it follows that the owner can also be known as the sharer and the one or more other users can also be known as the recipients. 

In one example one or more content items associated with a content management system account of the sharer can be shared with a content management system account of a recipient. The content management system can process the content item to be shared. For example the content management system can analyze one or more content portions of the content item and or other data associated with the content item. The content management system can determine at least some information about the content item based on the processing or analyzing. In one example the content management system can determine one or more properties associated with the content item one or more representations of one or more content portions present in the content item or any combination thereof.

Continuing with the example the content management system can transmit a communication notifying the recipient account that the sharer account has shared the content item with the recipient account. The communication can also include the determined information about the content item which can correspond to the one or more properties of the content item and or the one or more representations of the content portions of the content item. This information can enable the recipient to make an informed decision or at least a relatively better decision regarding whether or not the recipient would likely be interested in the shared content item. If the recipient so chooses the recipient can accept the share invitation and access the shared content item.

It is important to note that the various embodiments and or examples discussed herein are for illustrative purposes only. A person having ordinary skill in the art would recognize various other manners or approaches that can be utilized consistent with the scope of the present disclosure. Various other functions and advantages are described and suggested below as may be provided in accordance with the various embodiments.

Various embodiments of the disclosure are discussed in detail below. While specific implementations are discussed it should be understood that this is done for illustration purposes only. A person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other components and configurations may be used without parting from the spirit and scope of the disclosure.

The disclosed technology addresses the need in the art for providing information about content shared via a content management system. Various embodiments of the disclosed technology can enable a content item associated with a sharer account of the content management system to be shared with a recipient account of the content management system. The content item can be analyzed to determine at least some information about the content item which can include one or more properties associated with the content item one or more representations of one or more content portions present in the content item or any combination thereof. A communication can notify the recipient account that the sharer account has shared the content item with the recipient account. The communication can further comprise the determined information about the content item which can include the one or more properties and or the one or more representations of the content portions. This information can enable the recipient to make a better decision regarding whether or not to accept the share invitation.

With respect to implementing various embodiments of the disclosed technology an exemplary system configuration is shown in wherein electronic devices communicate via a network for purposes of exchanging content and other data. The system can be configured for use on a wide area network such as that illustrated in . However the present principles are applicable to a wide variety of network configurations that facilitate the intercommunication of electronic devices. For example each of the components of system in can be implemented in a localized or distributed fashion in a network.

In system a user can interact with content management system through client devices . . . collectively connected to network by direct and or indirect communication. Content management system can support connections from a variety of different client devices such as desktop computers mobile computers mobile communications devices e.g. mobile phones smart phones tablets smart televisions set top boxes and or any other network enabled computing devices. Client devices can be of varying type capabilities operating systems etc. Furthermore content management system can concurrently accept connections from and interact with multiple client devices .

A user can interact with content management system via a client side application installed on client device . In some embodiments the client side application can include a content management system specific component. For example the component can be a stand alone application one or more application plug ins and or a browser extension. However the user can also interact with content management system via a third party application such as a web browser that resides on client device and is configured to communicate with content management system . In either case the client side application can present a user interface UI for the user to interact with content management system . For example the user can interact with the content management system via a client side application integrated with the file system or via a webpage displayed using a web browser application.

Content management system can make it possible for a user to store content as well as perform a variety of content management tasks such as retrieve modify browse and or share the content. Furthermore content management system can make it possible for a user to access the content from multiple client devices . For example client device can upload content to content management system via network . The content can later be retrieved from content management system using the same client device or some other client device .

To facilitate the various content management services a user can create an account with content management system . The account information can be maintained in user account database . User account database can store profile information for registered users. In some cases the only personal information in the user profile can be a username and or email address. However content management system can also be configured to accept additional user information.

User account database can also include account management information such as account type e.g. free or paid usage information e.g. file edit history maximum storage space authorized storage space used content storage locations security settings personal configuration settings content sharing data etc. Account management module can be configured to update and or obtain user account details in user account database . The account management module can be configured to interact with any number of other modules in content management system .

An account can be used to store content such as digital data documents text files audio files video files etc. from one or more client devices authorized on the account. The content can also include folders or other mechanisms of grouping content items together with different behaviors such as collections playlists albums etc. For example an account can include a public folder that is accessible to any user. The public folder can be assigned a web accessible address. A link to the web accessible address can be used to access the contents of the public folder. In another example an account can include a photos folder that is intended for photos and that provides specific attributes and actions tailored for photos an audio folder that provides the ability to play back audio files and perform other audio related actions or other special purpose folders. An account can also include shared folders or group folders that are linked with and available to multiple user accounts. The permissions for multiple users may be different for a shared folder.

The content can be stored in content storage . Content storage can be a storage device multiple storage devices or a server. Alternatively content storage can be a cloud storage provider or network storage accessible via one or more communications networks. Content management system can hide the complexity and details from client devices so that client devices do not need to know exactly where the content items are being stored by content management system . In one variation content management system can store the content items in the same folder hierarchy as they appear on client device . However content management system can store the content items in its own order arrangement or hierarchy. Content management system can store the content items in a network accessible storage SAN device in a redundant array of inexpensive disks RAID etc. Content storage can store content items using one or more partition types such as FAT FAT32 NTFS EXT2 EXT3 EXT4 ReiserFS BTRFS and so forth.

Content storage can also store metadata describing content items content item types and the relationship of content items to various accounts folders or groups. The metadata for a content item can be stored as part of the content item or can be stored separately. In one variation each content item stored in content storage can be assigned a system wide unique identifier.

Content storage can decrease the amount of storage space required by identifying duplicate files or duplicate segments of files. Instead of storing multiple copies content storage can store a single copy and then use a pointer or other mechanism to link the duplicates to the single copy. Similarly content storage can store files more efficiently as well as provide the ability to undo operations by using a file version control that tracks changes to files different versions of files including diverging version trees and a change history. The change history can include a set of changes that when applied to the original file version produce the changed file version.

Content management system can be configured to support automatic synchronization of content from one or more client devices . The synchronization can be platform agnostic. That is the content can be synchronized across multiple client devices of varying type capabilities operating systems etc. For example client device can include client software which synchronizes via a synchronization module at content management system content in client device s file system with the content in an associated user account. In some cases the client software can synchronize any changes to content in a designated folder and its sub folders such as new deleted modified copied or moved files or folders. The client software can be a separate software application can integrate with an existing content management application in the operating system or some combination thereof. In one example of client software that integrates with an existing content management application a user can manipulate content directly in a local folder while a background process monitors the local folder for changes and synchronizes those changes to content management system . Conversely the background process can identify content that has been updated at content management system and synchronize those changes to the local folder. The client software can provide notifications of synchronization operations and can provide indications of content statuses directly within the content management application. Sometimes client device may not have a network connection available. In this scenario the client software can monitor the linked folder for file changes and queue those changes for later synchronization to content management system when a network connection is available. Similarly a user can manually stop or pause synchronization with content management system .

A user can also view or manipulate content via a web interface generated and served by user interface module . For example the user can navigate in a web browser to a web address provided by content management system . Changes or updates to content in the content storage made through the web interface such as uploading a new version of a file can be propagated back to other client devices associated with the user s account. For example multiple client devices each with their own client software can be associated with a single account and files in the account can be synchronized between each of the multiple client devices .

Content management system can include a communications interface for interfacing with various client devices and can interact with other content and or service providers . . . collectively via an Application Programming Interface API . Certain software applications can access content storage via an API on behalf of a user. For example a software package such as an app on a smartphone or tablet computing device can programmatically make calls directly to content management system when a user provides credentials to read write create delete share or otherwise manipulate content. Similarly the API can allow users to access all or part of content storage through a web site.

Content management system can also include authenticator module which can verify user credentials security tokens API calls specific client devices and so forth to ensure only authorized clients and users can access files. Further content management system can include analytics module module that can track and report on aggregate file operations user actions network usage total storage space used as well as other technology usage or business metrics. A privacy and or security policy can prevent unauthorized access to user data stored with content management system .

Content management system can include sharing module for managing sharing content publicly or privately. Sharing content publicly can include making the content item accessible from any computing device in network communication with content management system . Sharing content privately can include linking a content item in content storage with two or more user accounts so that each user account has access to the content item. The sharing can be performed in a platform agnostic manner. That is the content can be shared across multiple client devices of varying type capabilities operating systems etc. The content can also be shared across varying types of user accounts.

In some embodiments content management system can be configured to maintain a content directory identifying the location of each content item in content storage . The content directory can include a unique content entry for each content item stored in the content storage.

A content entry can include a content path that can be used to identify the location of the content item in a content management system. For example the content path can include the name of the content item and a folder hierarchy associated with the content item. For example the content path can include a folder or path of folders in which the content item is placed as well as the name of the content item. Content management system can use the content path to present the content items in the appropriate folder hierarchy.

A content entry can also include a content pointer that identifies the location of the content item in content storage . For example the content pointer can include the exact storage address of the content item in memory. In some embodiments the content pointer can point to multiple locations each of which contains a portion of the content item.

In addition to a content path and content pointer a content entry can also include a user account identifier that identifies the user account that has access to the content item. In some embodiments multiple user account identifiers can be associated with a single content entry indicating that the content item has shared access by the multiple user accounts.

To share a content item privately sharing module can be configured to add a user account identifier to the content entry associated with the content item thus granting the added user account access to the content item. Sharing module can also be configured to remove user account identifiers from a content entry to restrict a user account s access to the content item.

To share content publicly sharing module can be configured to generate a custom network address such as a uniform resource locator URL which allows any web browser to access the content in content management system without any authentication. To accomplish this sharing module can be configured to include content identification data in the generated URL which can later be used to properly identify and return the requested content item. For example sharing module can be configured to include the user account identifier and the content path in the generated URL. Upon selection of the URL the content identification data included in the URL can be transmitted to content management system which can use the received content identification data to identify the appropriate content entry and return the content item associated with the content entry.

In addition to generating the URL sharing module can also be configured to record that a URL to the content item has been created. In some embodiments the content entry associated with a content item can include a URL flag indicating whether a URL to the content item has been created. For example the URL flag can be a Boolean value initially set to 0 or false to indicate that a URL to the content item has not been created. Sharing module can be configured to change the value of the flag to 1 or true after generating a URL to the content item.

In some embodiments sharing module can also be configured to deactivate a generated URL. For example each content entry can also include a URL active flag indicating whether the content should be returned in response to a request from the generated URL. For example sharing module can be configured to only return a content item requested by a generated link if the URL active flag is set to 1 or true. Thus access to a content item for which a URL has been generated can be easily restricted by changing the value of the URL active flag. This allows a user to restrict access to the shared content item without having to move the content item or delete the generated URL. Likewise sharing module can reactivate the URL by again changing the value of the URL active flag to 1 or true. A user can thus easily restore access to the content item without the need to generate a new URL.

While content management system is presented with specific components it should be understood by one skilled in the art that the architectural configuration of system is simply one possible configuration and that other configurations with more or less components are also possible.

With reference now to shows an exemplary interface through which information about a shared content item can be provided. Exemplary interface can include an interface for an electronic mailing i.e. email system. In the example of User B can sign into User B s account with the email system. The email system can allow User B to send and or receive email messages.

In one example User A of an online content management system e.g. content management system in can send a shared content item invitation to User B via the online content management system. In other words User A can make a request to the online content management system to share one or more of his content items with User B . The online content management system can receive User A s request and cause an email message to be transmitted to an email account associated with User B s content management system account. As shown in the example of email message can be transmitted by the content management system and received by User B s email account. In the example email message can include message content .

Conventional approaches generally notify a recipient user that a file folder has been shared with the recipient. However various embodiments of the present disclosure enable much more detail or additional information to be provided to recipients of the shared content. Continuing with the example of email message content not only includes a message notifying User B that User A has shared a content item with User B via the content management system but message content also provides various kinds of information about the shared content item such as one or more properties or details of the shared content item. For example the various information can include but is not limited to the name of the shared content item e.g. the size of the shared content item e.g. the quantity e.g. of sub level content items if any included within Content Item J the names e.g. of the sub level content items the sizes e.g. of the sub level content items and or the content types e.g. for the sub level content items.

In the example of Content Item J can be a shared directory e.g. folder . Message content can indicate that Content Item K is a sub level content item within Content Item J e.g. a file within a folder . Message content can indicate that Content Item K is 43 KB in size and has a content type e.g. file type file format of document such as a word processing document text or a portable document format PDF . Further Content Item L can be a 1.2 MB image content item within Content Item J . Moreover Content Item M can be a 2.7 MB video content item within Content Item J . Accordingly User B can make an informed decision or at least a relatively better decision regarding whether or not to accept the shared content invitation from User A.

In one example perhaps User A and User B went to an event together and User B might have been expecting media and other files related to the event from User A. Although the shared content item is labeled as Content Item J in this is just for explanatory purposes. In this example shared content item could instead have been be labeled Press Meeting on Jan. 1 2013. Similarly content item could have been named Minutes . Content item could have been called User A User B Photo Likewise content item could have been identified as Press meeting video recording . This and other information can allow User B to better determine how relevant the shared content is with respect to User B . Thus User B can better decide whether or not he should accept and or access the shared content e.g. via button link .

In some embodiments the information about the shared content item can be received or obtained e.g. downloaded at a time when the recipient user accesses e.g. views opens etc. the email message. As such the information about the shared content item provided to the recipient user can be with respect to the most recent version of the shared content item e.g. incorporating any modifications to the shared content item between the time the email message was sent and the time when the recipient user accesses the email message .

In one example User A can invite User B to a shared content item. In this example User A can transmit the invite to the content management system. The content management system can in response send a communication to User B via the client application running on the computing device of User B. Based on the communication the client application can present notification or another indicator to User B. For example notification can include a message indicating that User A has shared a content item with User B. However not only does notification indicate that User A has shared the content item but notification can also provide details or other information about the shared content item.

As shown in notification can provide information including one or more properties of the shared content item. For example notification can specify the name of the sharer User A and the name of the shared content item Content Item J . Notification can also specify Content Item J s creator or author User A and when Content Item J was created or authored May 1 2013 as shown in element . Notification can also state for example who most recently modified Content Item J User C and when May 2 2013 as shown in element . Further notification can indicate one or more user accounts e.g. User A User C User D with which Content Item J has been shared as shown in element . It is also contemplated that notification can provide various other information about the shared content item.

Continuing with the example these pieces of information e.g. etc. can allow User B to better gauge how interested he would be in Content Item J. In some embodiments if User B so chooses he can accept User A s share invite and access Content Item J by interacting with e.g. clicking on hovering over etc. notification . In some embodiments User B can accept the share invite and access Content Item J by interacting with icon which as previously mentioned can be a representation of the client application for the content management system.

In addition to notification of window of can further provide information about shared Content Item J. Furthermore window can provide option to accept or decline the share invitation from User A with respect to Content Item J.

In some embodiments the client application can be running while the computing device is in an active state e.g. powered on logged in not in sleep mode not in hibernation mode etc. and capable of communicating with the content management system e.g. connect to a network such as the Internet . As such notifications can be provided by the client application in real time i.e. within an allowable time period relative to when User A initiates the share invitation via the content management system.

Also in some embodiments when a sharer or other sharing member of a content item revises edits or otherwise modifies the shared content item before a recipient user accepts the share invite the content management system can cause information about the revision edit or modification to be provided to the recipient user. In one example if the sharer or other sharing member adds a new file to a shared directory the size of the shared directory can increase. Information about this size increase can be provided to the recipient user. For example the content management system can cause the information about the size increase to be presented to the recipient user via notification in notification in and or window in . Therefore providing information about shared content items can be a dynamic process for example such that if the recipient user views a notification or window or communication more than once the information provided can change.

In another example a recipient user can be interacting with an email message e.g. message in associated with content shared by a sharer via the content management system. In this example the recipient user can click on a button link etc. e.g. button in within the email message to cause the web browser to execute and navigate to the web interface for the content management system which can display window or otherwise provide information about the shared content to the recipient user.

In a further example the recipient user can interact with an interactive element e.g. button link clickable notification window etc. provided by a client application e.g. represented by icon in represented by icon in and . In this example the interactive element provided by the client application can be associated with the content shared by the sharer via the content management system. The recipient user s interaction with the interactive element can cause the web browser to execute and navigate to the web interface for the content management system which can display window or otherwise provide information about the shared content to the recipient user.

Moreover in some embodiments when a sharer or other sharing member of a content item revises edits or otherwise modifies the shared content item before a recipient user accepts the share invite the content management system can cause information about the revision edit or modification to be provided to the recipient user via the web interface. Therefore providing information about shared content items via the web interface can also be a dynamic real time process.

In some embodiments notification can provide information about the shared content item. Information can allow User B to make a better decision regarding whether or not to access the shared content item by interacting with e.g. clicking on tapping at swiping at etc. notification or with the app for the content management system installed on device . However in some embodiments in order to save display space reduce distraction etc. information about the shared content item need not be displayed within notification and instead can be provided subsequently in response to an interaction with respect to notification .

Referring now to and there can be an exemplary computing device embodiment at which information about a shared content item can be provided. Exemplary computing device embodiment in and can be associated with User B and can implement an app for the content management system. In response to User A s invitation to User B regarding shared Content Item J the app installed on device can provide notification specifying that User A has made the invitation to share Content Item J with User B as shown in . As discussed above in some embodiments information about shared Content Item J need not be presented with notification . Instead User B can interact with notification to cause the app to display interface of . Interface can correspond to a graphical user interface GUI for the app for the content management system. Interface can provide information about the shared content item as well as an option to accept or decline the share invitation.

In addition similar to previous discussions in some embodiments providing information about a shared content item to a recipient user can performed dynamically and or in real time. As such in some cases information about modifications to the shared content item can be provided to the recipient user.

Turning now to shows an exemplary interface through which information about a shared content item can be provided. In exemplary email system interface is shown as an example for illustrative purposes only . A person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that various other interfaces or approaches for providing information about shared content can be utilized as well.

In the example of User B can be logged into his email account which can be associated with his account at the content management system. Exemplary email system interface can receive and present email message at User B s email account. Email message can include message content . Email message content can include a statement indicating that User A has shared a content item with User B . Further message content can provide information about the shared content item Content Item J .

In some embodiments information about a shared content item can include one or more properties details characteristics etc. of the shared content item. In some embodiments the information about the shared content item can include one or more representations of one or more content portions of the shared content item. With reference to Content Item J can include sub level Content Item K sub level Content Item L and sub level Content Item M. In other words Content Item K Content Item L and Content Item M can be shared content items within shared Content Item J. As such information about shared Content Item J can include information about shared sub level Content Items K L and M.

In the example of Content Item K can have at least some text content portions and thus information about Content Item K can include a snippet of text that is present in Content Item K. In other words the snippet of text can correspond to a representation of a text content portion included in Content Item K. The representation of the text content portion e.g. snippet of text for Content Item K can include at least one keyword present within Content Item K. In some embodiments the content management system can analyze Content Item K to identify the at least one keyword or key phrase key characters etc. . For example the content management system can analyze Content Item K to determine a level of relevancy with respect to at least one sequence of characters e.g. key word key phrase etc. present in Content Item K. In other words the content management system can analyze a content item to determine whether or not there are any words phrases and or strings of characters that might be sufficiently relevant e.g. sufficiently important significant useful etc. .

In some embodiments the content management system can take into consideration the uniqueness of a particular word or phrase string of characters etc. with respect to other words phrases etc. in the content item. Additionally or alternatively the content management system can take into consideration how often a particular word or phrase string etc. appears with respect to content items associated with a particular user. Moreover the content management system can take into consideration whether or not a particular word is a proper noun highlighted bolded underlined italicized or otherwise emphasized. A person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize various other factors and or approaches to identifying key words phrases or characters within a content item. Based on these analyzes separately or in combination and or other considerations the content management system can identify at least one sequence of characters e.g. key word key phrase etc. when the level of relevancy with respect to the at least one sequence of characters at least meets a relevancy threshold.

Referring back to the example involving shared Content Item K the content management system can identify the key phrase ABC Company as being likely sufficiently relevant. The key phrase ABC Company can be provided as information about shared Content Item K. In some instances the at least one keyword can be emphasized. Further in some instances the at least one key word phrase etc. can be provided in conjunction with one or more surrounding words or characters in the context of the at least one keyword. As such a content portion representation e.g. snippet of text for shared Content Item K can be . . . and ABC Company sales are . . . . The content portion representation can enable User B to make a better decision regarding whether or not to accept the share invitation from User A.

In some embodiments the content portion representation e.g. snippet of text that is provided or displayed to the recipient user can correspond to a recently edited text portion. For example if the sharer or other sharing member of a content item adds a sentence to a text portion of the content item then the added sentence or at least a portion thereof can be included in the content portion representation and be presented or displayed.

In another example Content Item L can be an image content item or can include at least an image content portion. As such information about Content Item L can include an image representation of the image content present in Content Item L. As shown in the image representation for Content Item L can correspond to a thumbnail image. In a further example Content Item M can be a video content item or can include at least a video content portion. Thus information about Content Item M can include a video representation of the video content present in Content Item M. In some cases the video representation for Content Item M can correspond to a down sampled video portion or other sampled animation e.g. GIF image of the full length video content of Content Item M.

Although not shown in there can be other suitable representations for other content types. For example when a content item or content portion is associated with audio an audio sample can be used as the representation for the audio content.

It is also contemplated that the information about the shared content item can include one or more properties details about the shared content item one or more content portions of the shared content item and or other data about the shared content item. In other words the information about the shared content item can include properties of the shared content item content portions of the shared content item data representations of the shared content item or any combination thereof.

At step exemplary method can analyze the content item to determine at least one of a property or a representation of a content portion associated with the content item.

In some embodiments the communication can indicate that the sharer account has requested to share the content item with the at least one recipient account. Then method can enable the at least one of the property or the representation of the content portion to be included in the communication to the at least one recipient account at step . The at least one of the property or the representation can enable the at least one recipient account to make a better decision regarding whether to accept or decline the shared content item.

At step exemplary method can analyze the one or more content items to determine information about the one or more content items. The information can include at least one of a property or a representation of a content portion associated with the one or more content items. Step can include transmitting to the second account a communication including the information about the one or more content items. In some embodiments the communication can also indicate that the first account has requested to share the one or more content items with the second account.

At step method can receive at the second account information about the one or more content items. The information can include at least one of a property or a representation of a content portion associated with the one or more content items. Step can include presenting at the second account the notification of the request and the information including the at least one of the property or the representation of the content portion. Furthermore in some embodiments method can also present an option to access the one or more content items being shared with the second account.

In some embodiments information about one or more shared content items includes one or more properties of the shared content items. This can include at least one of an identifier for an author of each content item of the one or more shared content items data indicating when each content item was created an identifier for a last modifier of each content item data indicating when each content item was last modified a identifier for each content item a size of each content item an identifier for another account with which the one or more content items are shared a quantity of one or more sub level content items within each content item an identifier for each sub level content item of the one or more sub level content items a size for each sub level content item a content type for each sub level content item an identifier for an author of each sub level content item data indicating when each sub level content item was created an identifier for a last modifier of each sub level content item or data indicating when each sub level content item was last modified.

In some embodiments an option for the recipient user to download a local version of the shared content item can be presented. The local version can be a copy of the shared content item that is not synced among the shared members. Accordingly modifications by the recipient user to the local version will not be updated or reflected with respect to the shared content item at the accounts of the other sharing members e.g. the sharer and other recipients . Similarly modifications to the shared content item by the other sharing members will not be updated or reflected with respect to the local version.

Furthermore in some embodiments if the recipient user chooses to download a local version of the shared content item the recipient user can select which of the sub level content items within the shared content item to download as local copies.

Various embodiments of the present technology can also implement a determination of a level of relevancy for shared content. In one example a relevancy score for a shared content item can be calculated. The relevancy score can indicate how relevant the shared content item will likely be with respect to the recipient user. The relevancy score can be calculated for example based on analyzing content portions of the content item data about the recipient user activity of other recipient users of the content item etc. In some cases the relevancy score can be included in the information about the shared content item.
