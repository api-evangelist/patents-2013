These and other features will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.

It should be understood at the outset that although illustrative implementations of one or more embodiments are illustrated below the disclosed systems and methods may be implemented using any number of techniques whether currently known or in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations drawings and techniques illustrated below but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.

The present disclosure teaches an application for user notification executing on a portable electronic device that displays several types of notifications when any one of a plurality of different types of events occur. The notification application may display notifications about events in small temporary windows and in notification screens listing multiple events. Events may be associated with incoming communications of various types and with messages generated internally by the portable electronic device. When the portable electronic device receives a text message or instant message for example the notification application may display an announcement transiently in a small window within the display of the portable electronic device. The most recently received external communication or internally generated message may be briefly displayed when the user navigates away from an application within which the user had been working when the text or instant message was received or the next time the portable electronic device is powered on or otherwise activated.

The notification application also presents a message associated with external communications and internally generated messages in the notification screen that provides a chronological or other listing of external communications and internally generated messages that have not yet been opened or accessed by the user. Messages may continue to be presented in the notification screen until the message is highlighted accessed opened or otherwise acted upon by a user of the portable electronic device which may be referred to in some contexts as actioning the message and the subject message may be said to have been actioned. In some cases the underlying application associated with the message may be invoked and activated by selecting the message for example by highlighting the message and or clicking on the message. Once a message has been accessed viewed and or actioned this message may not be presented in the notification screen in subsequent times the notification screen is opened.

Events may comprise communications coming to the portable electronic device from sources external to the portable electronic device including telephone voice mail messages text messages instant messages electronic mail messages and notifications from social networking sites. Events comprising internally generated messages may comprise messages about missed phone calls messages generated by a calendaring application internal messages advising that an application has completed executing a task or the application has failed and messages about hardware status for example. The notification application may list prioritize and group messages associated with external communications and internally generated messages in a variety of manners.

The present disclosure teaches the transient presentation of an announcement advising the user of the most recent external communication or internal event occurring on the portable electronic device. Such announcements presented transiently and additional external communications and internal messages are placed in the notification screen that may be viewed as a front end for most or all new communication and other event notification activity. Messages appearing in the notification screen may provide access to the messages through their applications. Opening a message in the notification screen about an instant message for example may result in the instant message application activating on the portable electronic device and causing the instant message to be displayed for the user s review and response or deletion. In alternative embodiments instead of the single most recent external communication or internal event being announced the most recent two or three such items could be announced or the communications or events that occurred within the last five minutes ten minutes or other time period could be announced. In yet another alternative embodiment the communications or events that occurred since the user began using a particular application could be announced.

Turning now to a system of mobile device user interface notification management is described. The system comprises portable electronic devices notification applications notification screens an electronic mail server an electronic mail database a voice mail server a voice mail database a base transceiver station and a network .

The portable electronic devices may be one of a mobile phone a personal digital assistant PDA and a media player. The portable electronic device comprises a radio transceiver that transmits and receives based on at least one of a code division multiple access CDMA technology a global system for mobile communication GSM technology a long term evolution LTE technology and a worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX technology.

The notification application executes on the portable electronic device and temporarily presents announcements on a home page or other screen of the portable electronic device and also posts the announcements as messages in the notification screen . The announcements are generated and displayed when the user of the portable electronic device navigates away from an open application or powers on or otherwise activates the portable electronic device . An announcement briefly describes the most recent external communication or internal message received before the user navigated away from the open application or activated the portable electronic device . External communications may comprise the receipt of a telephone voice mail message an electronic mail message a text message an instant message and other types of incoming communications. Events also may be generated within the portable electronic device and may be associated with calendaring application and hardware events or occurrences. The notification application may present the announcement immediately upon occurrence of the event or wait until the user returns to the home page or navigates away from the application in which the user was engaged when the event occurred. The notification screen in which announcements are posted as messages lists external communications and internally generated messages that have not yet been acted upon or actioned by the user. Once actioned the messages may remain saved in their own application folders but no longer appear in the notification screen .

The portable electronic device may receive a plurality of external communications and internally generated messages during a period of time that a user is working in an application or the portable electronic device is powered off. The notification application may present as an announcement only the most recently received item at the time the user navigates away from the application or powers on the portable electronic device . While the notification application may place most or all received messages in the notification screen only the most recently received message is displayed as an announcement. Events listed as messages in the notification screen include events displayed in announcements. There may be nothing that distinguishes a message initially displayed as an announcement from all other messages displayed in the notification screen other than that an event displayed as an announcement was by coincidence the most recent event to occur before the user navigated away from an application.

The notification application may present announcements in a small message window that remains visible for a short period for example ten seconds while the home page of the portable electronic device is presented or the user navigates away from or exits an application or ends a telephone call. The announcement is intended to notify the user of the most recent external communication or internally generated message. The present disclosure teaches the notification screen as a list of pending messages or potential action items that have yet to be accessed and includes messages that were earlier displayed as announcements.

The notification screen may list messages associated with some events individually such as missed telephone calls text messages and instant messages. The notification screen may list other messages describing events in groups such as electronic mail messages and announcements from social networking Internet sites and other sources. Messages for events segregated into such group listings may be confined to the bottom of the viewable area of the notification screen . The notification application retains messages in the notification screen until the messages are accessed. The present disclosure teaches messages opened from within the notification screen or opened from within their own applications not being presented in the notification screen thereafter but with the messages remaining available within their own application functionality. The notification application presents external communications and internally generated messages that have yet to be highlighted accessed or actioned from within the notification screen or from within their own underlying applications. Other than presenting these unaccessed messages and providing the ability to access these messages the notification application may not interact with the underlying applications. Once accessed these messages do not again appear in subsequent presentations of the notification screen . In an alternative embodiment instant messages may not be listed individually but may instead be grouped together in a manner similar to that described for electronic mail messages and social networking notices.

The notification application comprises the receiving component that receives information about external communications and internally generated messages. The receiving component may poll applications executing on the portable electronic device or elsewhere to learn of the receipt of external communications such as the receipt of a text message for example. The receiving component may be provided advice of each external communication while the external communication item is being placed into its own application inbox or when the notification screen is being invoked. The notification application may poll the applications for unactioned events either periodically or at the time the notification screen is invoked for presentation. External communications may comprise telephone voice mail messages text messages simple message service SMS messages instant messaging messages multimedia messaging service MMS messages picture messages push to talk PTT messages and electronic mail messages. External communications may also comprise incoming transmissions from social networking Internet sites and other social networking sources. Such incoming social networking transmissions may be personally directed messages from the sender to the user of the portable electronic device or they may be general distribution messages from the sender to a plurality of portable electronic devices . The present disclosure teaches in some embodiments different methods of handling of the various types of social networking messages that a portable electronic device may receive. Social networking messages that are directed personally to the user of the portable electronic device may be treated as individually received messages as are for example instant messages and text messages. Social networking messages that are general distribution messages or announcements sent to the portable electronic device and a plurality of other recipients may be grouped collectively and displayed as a single item in the notifications screen in a manner similar to the treatment of electronic mail messages.

The receiving component also takes delivery of events that are generated internally by the portable electronic device . Such events may comprise messages that an incoming telephone call was missed without the caller leaving a voice mail message. Such events may comprise messages from a calendaring or other application executing on the portable electronic device . Such events may comprise hardware related messages that the battery power is low or that a component is failing for example. A communication item may comprise both internal and external elements. An application or other item of software may be downloading from the Internet and when finished a component internal to the portable electronic device may notify the receiving component . When a caller to the portable electronic device hangs up without leaving a message as noted above the notice to the receiving component about the missed call may be generated internally even though the precipitating event occurred externally.

The present disclosure may not provide for the receiving component intercepting intervening in or altering the actions of an underlying communications application executing on the portable electronic device other than causing the received external communication to be opened when the user selects the corresponding message in the notification screen . The receiving component may monitor the radio transceiver and other components of the portable electronic device for signals indicating the occurrence of externally originating communications events as well as internally occurring events. The receiving component may regularly poll applications for unactioned events. The notification application may interact with application programming interfaces API of the text messaging and voice mail applications for example that permit the receiving component to cause the incoming communications items to be opened upon the user s action. The receiving component may detect from the radio transceiver that a text message was received for example. The receiving component may contact the text messaging application executing on the portable electronic device and establish a link to the newly received text message allowing the receiving component to cause the text message to be opened upon user action. The receiving component may not intercept the incoming text message or otherwise interfere with its movement but may rather allow it to be received by the text messaging application and stored in the application s inbox as it normally would.

The notification application interacts with the text messaging application for example to receive the information it needs to create the announcement if appropriate as well as create the message that will be displayed in the notification screen . Incoming text messages electronic mail messages and other inbound messages are received and stored in their application inboxes not in a file associated with the notification application . The present disclosure teaches the notification application functioning in an information providing and message opening role. The service provided to the user is to make the user aware that an external communication or internal event has taken place.

The notification application also comprises the presentation component that presents the most recently received external communication item or internally generated message in an announcement comprising one or two lines. The announcement may be displayed for a predefined time duration of less than ten seconds. The present disclosure teaches the presentation of this announcement when the user of the portable electronic device navigates away from an application the user is currently using. Navigating away from an application may comprise the user exiting the application entirely minimizing the application in a graphical user interface GUI of the portable electronic device or opening an additional application. If the user is engaged in a telephone call on the portable electronic device navigating away may comprise the telephone call ending. The presentation component may maintain a file containing a chronological queue of external communications and internally generated messages received during the user s application session. When the user navigates away from the current application the presentation component may access the file and draw the most recently received external communication or internal message. The presentation component presents the announcement of the external communication or internal message for a duration of less than ten seconds. The information presented may comprise the type of message received the sender and the date and time received. In an embodiment the user may position a finger or electronic pointer over the announcement to prevent it from automatically disappearing and therefore be able to examine the announcement for a longer period. In an embodiment the user may be able to click on tap on or otherwise take action to activate and open the announcement.

In addition to displaying the announcement upon detecting that the user has navigated away from an application the presentation component may display the announcement upon detecting that the portable electronic device has just been powered on or brought out of a dormant or inactive state. In this circumstance the presentation component may display as an announcement the last external communication or internal message received before the portable electronic device was powered off or entered the dormant state. In an embodiment when the portable electronic device is powered on or is brought out of the dormant state the notification application may wait a predefined amount of time to permit the portable electronic device to announce itself on the network wherein external communications waiting out on the network as well as pending internally generated messages may be received by the receiving component . The notification application then may display the most recently received external communication or internal message as an announcement as described. In an embodiment the presentation component may not present the announcement until the user returns to the home screen or panel or other predefined screens of the portable electronic device .

In addition to displaying the most recently received external communication or internal message the presentation component also presents unactioned or unaccessed external communications and internal messages in the notification screen . The presentation component presents these unactioned or unaccessed messages whether received during the user s most recent application session during previous application sessions or while the portable electronic device may have been powered off or otherwise inactive. The present disclosure teaches the presentation component posting such messages for event items in chronological order with the most recently received unactioned or unaccessed message at the top of the notification screen . A message may describe the type of external communication for example a text message the identity of the sender and the date and time of the external communication i.e. when the message was received. The message presented also may provide a signal or other indication if the message is urgent or if some kind of response is imminently needed by the sender. The message also may include a photograph of the sender or another image or personalized information placed into the message by the sender. A photograph of the sender other image or other personalized information also may be associated with the sender s contact information that may be saved on the portable electronic device .

The presentation component may present messages in the notification screen for each individual missed phone call voice mail message text message and instant message received. Multiple messages of these types received from the same sender are listed individually. The presentation component may also create a single entry in the notification screen for each internally generated message received. The presentation component by contrast may create a single entry in the notification screen for a plurality of electronic mail messages received regardless of the sender. The presentation component also may create a single entry in the notification screen for a plurality of general distribution messages received from social networking sites. The notification screen displays a single line item containing electronic mail messages and contains another line item containing general distribution messages received from social networking sites. These line items may resemble individual messages in appearance in the notification screen but instead may display the number of individual electronic mail messages or social networking messages contained within the line items and also may display the date time and sender of the most recent message contained within. The present disclosure teaches the individual presentation of external communications and internal messages meant for the user of the portable electronic device personally. By gathering received electronic mail messages and social networking site distribution messages in single entries in the notification screen the present disclosure may suggest a lower prioritization for such messages.

The notification screen may be accessed from the home screen or other screen upon action by the user. In an embodiment the user may use a pointing device or finger to touch a lip or slight protrusion from a menu bar in the portable electronic device to cause the notification screen to appear. Each time the user invokes the notification screen the notification screen lists external communications and internal messages received since the previous time the notification screen was invoked for presentation. The notification screen also displays older messages that had been displayed in the immediately previous notification screen that were not accessed during that previous invocation and remained unactioned or unaccessed. In some embodiments the notification application could age out messages that have not been accessed for a predetermined period of time. The notification application could also phase out old but unactioned messages as a threshold total number of received messages is reached. Messages that had been displayed in previously presented notification screen that the user accessed during an earlier session do not appear in the current notification screen . Messages that are unactioned or unaccessed may continue to be displayed in the notification screen until they are accessed. What was displayed previously but not accessed is continually displayed in notification screen until accessed. Once accessed messages may not appear in subsequent notification screen . External communications and internal messages that are received after the closure of a notification screen and accessed from within their own applications before the notification screen is next invoked may not appear in the next or subsequent notification screen . Because those external communications and internal messages have been accessed they may not be displayed in the notification screen the next time it is invoked. Such messages that are received and accessed from within their own applications between invocations of the notification screen may never be displayed in an invocation of the notification screen . While the presentation component may present messages in the notification screen in reverse chronological order with the most recently received message appearing at the top of the list and without regard to the type of messages displayed in an embodiment the presentation component may present the messages using chronological ordering or a different ordering or arrangement method.

As noted the presentation component may present electronic mail messages in a single item in the notification screen instead of individually as is the case for text messages instant messages and other incoming transmissions as previously described. The presentation component also groups incoming general social networking announcements in a similar manner in a single notification screen item. In an embodiment the present disclosure teaches the placement of the single notification screen listings associated with the grouped electronic mail items and the grouped social networking items at the bottom of the displayed portion of the notification screen below a scrollable list of individually displayed messages. Even though the full listing of the messages in the notification screen may be longer than can be displayed in a single view of the notification screen and hence not possible to be all viewed at once the two items for the grouped electronic mail items and the grouped social networking items may remain persistently at the bottom of the viewable portion of the notification screen . The two items remain in the same place no matter the portion of the notification screen in which the user may be scrolling.

The portable electronic device is substantially similar to the portable electronic device in feature and functionality. The notification application executes on the portable electronic device and comprises the receiving component and the presentation component and are substantially alike components of similar name resident on the portable electronic device .

Turning now to two sample views of the notification screen are presented to illustrate the actions of the presentation component with regard to the notification screen . depicts a first screen view and a second screen view of the notification screen presented on the portable electronic device . The first screen view and the second screen view depict chronologically successive views of the notification screen of the portable electronic device . A user of the portable electronic device may navigate away from a first application in which the user has been working for a period of time and access the first screen view . The first screen view may contain messages that were received since the last time the user examined the notification screen and may contain older unactioned messages existing prior to the user s previous viewing of the notification screen in the first screen view .

The first screen view contains a plurality of different types of messages displayed in the order in which they were received. As noted electronic mail messages and social networking site announcements are grouped collectively in single entries that persistently remain at the bottom of the displayed portion of notification screen . Each of the single entries may display the total number of electronic mail messages and social networking site announcements contained within each entry. Upon accessing the notification screen and examining the first screen view the user observes two messages received since the last time the notification screen was presented as well as five messages that appeared in the previous notification screen that the user did not select. Moments before accessing the first screen view the user may have seen an announcement advising of the receipt of Text Message 3 because that message is the most recently received external communication or internal message. The discussion of will assume that while examining the first screen view of the notification screen the user clicks on or otherwise accesses only Text Message 2 Missed Call 1 and Instant Message 1 leaving the other posted messages untouched and not yet viewed. The user closes the first screen view . The user then begins accessing a second application on the portable electronic device .

Continuing discussion of the user may later navigate away from the second application be presented an announcement of the most recent external communication or internal message received and then open the notification screen again this time depicted as the second screen view . The second screen view shows that Text Message 2 Missed Call 1 and Instant Message 1 are no longer present and at the top are two new messages Voicemail Message 2 and Text Message 4. The items that had been shown in the first screen view as new Text Message 3 and Instant Message 2 that are displayed again in the second screen view because they were not accessed during the earlier session are now marked as previous in the second screen view . Newly received items are placed at the top of the notification screen . If the listing of messages exceeds the viewing area of the notification screen the user may scroll down and view the listing of the oldest messages at the bottom of the scrollable list that still await initial user access. The ordering of the messages in with the older messages having the lower numbers and the newer messages having the higher numbers has been depicted in such a manner for discussion purposes. Embodiments of the present disclosure may number and sequence messages in the notification screen in a plurality of different manners. Shortly after a user of the portable electronic device navigated away from the second application the presentation component would have displayed an announcement showing Voicemail Message 2 because that external communication was the most recently occurring event at the time. The placement of messages into the first screen view and the second screen view and the determination of message location and ordering after notification screens are closed may constitute stateful behavior by the notification application .

The placement of the words new and previous next to messages in is for discussion and demonstration purposes. In an embodiment messages displayed in the notification screen may not be accompanied by the words new or previous. The items in the first screen view and the second screen view for electronic mail messages and social networking notices display the quantities of each type of message presently waiting to be accessed.

The electronic mail server may process electronic mail messages received from a plurality of senders for example the portable electronic device that may send an electronic mail message to the portable electronic device as well as from other sending components not shown in . The electronic mail database is associated with the electronic mail server and may store electronic mail messages received by the portable electronic devices . When an electronic mail message is received by the portable electronic device the electronic mail message may be stored in the electronic mail inbox associated with the portable electronic device that may reside in the electronic mail database .

The voice mail server may process telephone voice mail messages received from a plurality of callers. When a caller initiates a call to the portable electronic device and the user of the portable electronic device does not answer the caller may leave a voice mail message for the user. The voice mail message may be managed by the voice mail server and stored in the voice mail database that is associated with the voice mail server . When the user of the portable electronic device later navigates away from the current application in which the user has been working after seeing an announcement containing information about the most recently received external communication or internal message the user may then access the notification screen . The user will see in the notification screen an item for the voice mail message. If the user clicks on or otherwise selects the voice mail message a network session may be initiated with the voice mail server and the voice mail message may be retrieved from the voice mail database and played on the portable electronic device .

The base transceiver station may be any of a cellular wireless base station for example a Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Global System for Mobile Communications GSM Universal Mobile Communications System UMTS and or Long term Evolution LTE cellular wireless base station a World wide Interoperable Microwave Access WiMAX base station a WiFi access point a femtocell or other wireless access devices. While depicts only one base transceiver station in an embodiment a plurality of base transceiver stations may be existent and in operation.

The network promotes communication between the components of the system . The network may be any communication network including a public data network PDN a public switched telephone network PSTN a private network and or a combination.

The present disclosure also teaches the use of a call log that may supplement the notification screen . Missed phone calls and received voice mail messages are listed individually in the notification screen even missed phone calls and received voice mail messages from the same sender. The call log may supplement the notification screen by grouping missed phone calls and received voice mail messages by sender and by date. The call log may be accessed from the user interface of the portable electronic device .

The present disclosure also teaches a third form of notification in addition to the announcement and the notification screen that may be a hybrid of the two notification methods and present recent messages in a while you were out type of format. When a user of the portable electronic device navigates away from an application a temporary screen window or pane may appear and display the last few recent messages received. This display may be configurable by the user to show only a certain type of messages or only messages received from specific senders.

Turning now to and a method of presenting information about events on a portable electronic device is provided. Beginning at block information about a first event is stored in a memory of the portable electronic device .

At block information about a second event is stored in the memory wherein the information about the second event is stored in the memory after the information about the first event is stored in the memory. At block when a user of an application that is presented on the display of the portable electronic device navigates away from the application a message is presented about the second event on the display. Block describes the display of the announcement of the second event because the second event is the most recent event to occur on the portable electronic device prior to the user navigating away from the application.

At block the announcement of the second event is removed from the display after being presented for a predetermined time period for example about ten seconds. At block a first notification screen is presented on the display of the portable electronic device at a first time. The first notification screen comprises a first list of entries associated with a plurality of events the first list comprising a first entry associated with the first event a second entry associated with the second event an entry for each missed call among the plurality of events an entry for each pending text message among the plurality of events an entry for each pending instant message among the plurality of events a single entry for a plurality of emails among the plurality of events and a single entry for a plurality of update messages from a social networking facility among the plurality of events.

At block the portable electronic device receives a response input associated with the first event after the first time and before a second later time. The response input may comprise the user of the portable electronic device selecting the entry in the first notification screen for the first event by using a finger or pointing device to highlight and open the message in the notification screen associated with the first event. This allows the user to view the first event and respond to delete store or otherwise manage the first event.

At block the portable electronic device receives a response input associated with the second event after the first time and before the second time. As with the actions at block the response input may comprise the user of the portable electronic device selecting the entry in the first notification screen for the second event by using a finger or pointing device to highlight and open the message in the notification screen associated with the second event. This allows the user to view the second event as well as respond to delete store or otherwise manage it.

Blocks and comprise the user causing a new or first notification screen to be opened in the display and selecting and opening the messages associated with the first and second events. Those two events had taken place after the previous time the user had opened the notification screen so they appeared as new events in the first notification screen as described at block .

At block a second notification screen is presented on the display at the second time. The second notification screen comprises a second list of entries associated with a plurality of events comprising an entry for each missed call among the plurality of events an entry for each pending text message among the plurality of events an entry for each pending instant message among the plurality of events a single entry for a plurality of emails among the plurality of events and a single entry for a plurality of update messages from a social networking facility among the plurality of events.

Continuing at block the second notification screen does not comprise an entry for the first event nor does it comprise an entry for the second event. Those two events do not appear in the second notification screen because the user of the portable electronic device selected them earlier as described at blocks and during the presentation of the first notification screen . Because the first and second events were already selected and opened the present disclosure teaches that they do not appear in the second or later notification screen .

The mobile device includes a display and a touch sensitive surface and or keys for input by a user. The mobile device may present options for the user to select controls for the user to actuate and or cursors or other indicators for the user to direct. The mobile device may further accept data entry from the user including numbers to dial or various parameter values for configuring the operation of the handset. The mobile device may further execute one or more software or firmware applications in response to user commands. These applications may configure the mobile device to perform various customized functions in response to user interaction. Additionally the mobile device may be programmed and or configured over the air for example from a wireless base station a wireless access point or a peer mobile device .

The mobile device may execute a web browser application which enables the display to show a web page. The web page may be obtained via wireless communications with a base transceiver station BTS a wireless network access node a peer mobile device or any other wireless communication network or system. While a single base transceiver station is illustrated it is understood that the wireless communication system may comprise additional base transceiver stations. In some instances the mobile device may be in communication with multiple base transceiver stations at the same time. The base transceiver station or wireless network access node is coupled to a wired network such as the Internet. Via the wireless link and the wired network the mobile device has access to information on various servers such as a server . The server may provide content that may be shown on the display . Alternately the mobile device may access the base transceiver station through a peer mobile device acting as an intermediary in a relay type or hop type of connection.

The DSP or some other form of controller or central processing unit operates to control the various components of the mobile device in accordance with embedded software or firmware stored in memory or stored in memory contained within the DSP itself. In addition to the embedded software or firmware the DSP may execute other applications stored in the memory or made available via information carrier media such as portable data storage media like the removable memory card or via wired or wireless network communications. The application software may comprise a compiled set of machine readable instructions that configure the DSP to provide the desired functionality or the application software may be high level software instructions to be processed by an interpreter or compiler to indirectly configure the DSP .

The antenna and front end unit may be provided to convert between wireless signals and electrical signals enabling the mobile device to send and receive information from a radio access network RAN or some other available wireless communications network or from a peer mobile device . In an embodiment the antenna and front end unit may include multiple antennas to support beam forming and or multiple input multiple output MIMO operations. As is known to those skilled in the art MIMO operations may provide spatial diversity which can be used to overcome difficult channel conditions and or increase channel throughput. The antenna and front end unit may include antenna tuning and or impedance matching components RF power amplifiers and or low noise amplifiers.

The RF transceiver provides frequency shifting converting received RF signals to baseband and converting baseband transmit signals to RF. In some descriptions a radio transceiver or RF transceiver may be understood to include other signal processing functionality such as modulation demodulation coding decoding interleaving deinterleaving spreading despreading inverse fast Fourier transforming IFFT fast Fourier transforming FFT cyclic prefix appending removal and other signal processing functions. For the purposes of clarity the description here separates the description of this signal processing from the RF and or radio stage and conceptually allocates that signal processing to the analog baseband processing unit and or the DSP or other central processing unit. In some embodiments the RF transceiver portions of the antenna and front end and the analog baseband processing unit may be combined in one or more processing units and or application specific integrated circuits ASICs .

The analog baseband processing unit may provide various analog processing of inputs and outputs for example analog processing of inputs from the microphone and the headset port and outputs to the earpiece speaker and the headset port . To that end the analog baseband processing unit may have ports for connecting to the built in microphone and the earpiece speaker that enable the mobile device to be used as a mobile phone. The analog baseband processing unit may further include a port for connecting to a headset or other hands free microphone and speaker configuration. The analog baseband processing unit may provide digital to analog conversion in one signal direction and analog to digital conversion in the opposing signal direction. In some embodiments at least some of the functionality of the analog baseband processing unit may be provided by digital processing components for example by the DSP or by other central processing units.

The DSP may perform modulation demodulation coding decoding interleaving deinterleaving spreading despreading inverse fast Fourier transforming IFFT fast Fourier transforming FFT cyclic prefix appending removal and other signal processing functions associated with wireless communications. In an embodiment for example in a code division multiple access CDMA technology application for a transmitter function the DSP may perform modulation coding interleaving and spreading and for a receiver function the DSP may perform despreading deinterleaving decoding and demodulation. In another embodiment for example in an orthogonal frequency division multiplex access OFDMA technology application for the transmitter function the DSP may perform modulation coding interleaving inverse fast Fourier transforming and cyclic prefix appending and for a receiver function the DSP may perform cyclic prefix removal fast Fourier transforming deinterleaving decoding and demodulation. In other wireless technology applications yet other signal processing functions and combinations of signal processing functions may be performed by the DSP .

The DSP may communicate with a wireless network via the analog baseband processing unit . In some embodiments the communication may provide Internet connectivity enabling a user to gain access to content on the Internet and to send and receive e mail or text messages. The input output interface interconnects the DSP and various memories and interfaces. The memory and the removable memory card may provide software and data to configure the operation of the DSP . Among the interfaces may be the USB port and the infrared port . The USB port may enable the mobile device to function as a peripheral device to exchange information with a personal computer or other computer system. The infrared port and other optional ports such as a Bluetooth interface or an IEEE 802.11 compliant wireless interface may enable the mobile device to communicate wirelessly with other nearby handsets and or wireless base stations.

The input output interface may further connect the DSP to the vibrator that when triggered causes the mobile device to vibrate. The vibrator may serve as a mechanism for silently alerting the user to any of various events such as an incoming call a new text message and an appointment reminder.

The keypad couples to the DSP via the interface to provide one mechanism for the user to make selections enter information and otherwise provide input to the mobile device . Another input mechanism may be the touch screen LCD which may also display text and or graphics to the user. The touch screen LCD controller couples the DSP to the touch screen LCD .

The CCD camera enables the mobile device to take digital pictures. The DSP communicates with the CCD camera via the camera controller . The GPS sensor is coupled to the DSP to decode global positioning system signals thereby enabling the mobile device to determine its position. In another embodiment a camera operating according to a technology other than charge coupled device cameras may be employed. Various other peripherals may also be included to provide additional functions e.g. radio and television reception.

It is understood that by programming and or loading executable instructions onto the computer system at least one of the CPU the RAM and the ROM are changed transforming the computer system in part into a particular machine or apparatus having the novel functionality taught by the present disclosure. It is fundamental to the electrical engineering and software engineering arts that functionality that can be implemented by loading executable software into a computer can be converted to a hardware implementation by well known design rules. Decisions between implementing a concept in software versus hardware typically hinge on considerations of stability of the design and numbers of units to be produced rather than any issues involved in translating from the software domain to the hardware domain. Generally a design that is still subject to frequent change may be preferred to be implemented in software because re spinning a hardware implementation is more expensive than re spinning a software design. Generally a design that is stable that will be produced in large volume may be preferred to be implemented in hardware for example in an application specific integrated circuit ASIC because for large production runs the hardware implementation may be less expensive than the software implementation. Often a design may be developed and tested in a software form and later transformed by well known design rules to an equivalent hardware implementation in an application specific integrated circuit that hardwires the instructions of the software. In the same manner as a machine controlled by a new ASIC is a particular machine or apparatus likewise a computer that has been programmed and or loaded with executable instructions may be viewed as a particular machine or apparatus.

The secondary storage is typically comprised of one or more disk drives or tape drives and is used for non volatile storage of data and as an over flow data storage device if RAM is not large enough to hold all working data. Secondary storage may be used to store programs which are loaded into RAM when such programs are selected for execution. The ROM is used to store instructions and perhaps data which are read during program execution. ROM is a non volatile memory device which typically has a small memory capacity relative to the larger memory capacity of secondary storage . The RAM is used to store volatile data and perhaps to store instructions. Access to both ROM and RAM is typically faster than to secondary storage . The secondary storage the RAM and the ROM may be referred to in some contexts as non transitory storage or non transitory computer readable media.

Such information which may include data or instructions to be executed using processor for example may be received from and outputted to the network for example in the form of a computer data baseband signal or signal embodied in a carrier wave. The baseband signal or signal embodied in the carrier wave generated by the network connectivity devices may propagate in or on the surface of electrical conductors in coaxial cables in waveguides in an optical conduit for example an optical fiber or in the air or free space. The information contained in the baseband signal or signal embedded in the carrier wave may be ordered according to different sequences as may be desirable for either processing or generating the information or transmitting or receiving the information. The baseband signal or signal embedded in the carrier wave or other types of signals currently used or hereafter developed may be generated according to several methods well known to one skilled in the art. The baseband signal and or signal embedded in the carrier wave may be referred to in some contexts as a transitory signal.

Thus while instructions may be discussed as executed by a processor the instructions may be executed simultaneously serially or otherwise executed by one or multiple processors. Instructions codes computer programs scripts and or data which may be accessed from the secondary storage for example hard drive floppy disk optical disk and other from the ROM and the RAM may be referred to in some contexts as non transitory instructions or non transitory information.
