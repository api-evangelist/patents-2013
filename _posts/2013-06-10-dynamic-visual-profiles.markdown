Embodiments generally relate to intelligent agents. More particularly embodiments relate to the use of dynamic visual profiles to enhance real time recommendations from intelligent agents.

Software based intelligent agents may be used to retrieve recommendations for restaurants and other activities. In such a case a user of a handheld device may speak or type a request that is captured and processed by an intelligent agent running on the handheld device wherein the agent may use hidden selection criteria to generate a recommendation in response to the request.

Turning now to a set of screenshots is shown for a device . The device may be a computing device such as for example a smart phone smart tablet personal digital assistant PDA mobile Internet device MID convertible tablet notebook computer desktop computer smart television and so forth wherein the device may generally present various interfaces to a user via a display such as for example a touch screen liquid crystal display LCD and so forth. In the illustrated example a communication interface may enable a real time conversation such as a text messaging e.g. short messaging service SMS conversation an instant messaging IM conversation and so forth to take place between two or more individuals. As will be discussed in greater detail the conversation may also be a voice and or video conversation such as a cellular call and or video conferencing call between multiple individuals. In the illustrated example the user e.g. first user Me of the device conducts a chat conversation with another individual e.g. second user Doug about their plans for the weekend. The conversation may also take place between more than two users individuals.

One or more phrases in the conversation in the communication interface may be identified and used to generate a visual profile wherein the visual profile may include various images that are associated with the identified phrases. In the illustrated example images of a bicycle a city skyline a television TV show poster multiple movie studio logos a shoe and a microscope are all displayed in the visual profile based on phrases detected in conversations held by the user of the device . As will be discussed in greater detail the images may have corresponding metadata that describes the content of the images and facilitates the matching of phrases to related image content. Accordingly the visual profile may be closely tailored to the personality and needs of the user of the device .

In one example each conversation that a user has with different individuals may result in the generation of a different visual profile. For example if Sally and Doug are communicating with one another a first visual profile may be generated for that conversation. When Mark joins Sally and Doug a second visual profile may be generated.

The user may issue a recommendation request by for example selecting a share option from the communication interface wherein upon receiving the recommendation request the device may be configured to generate a real time recommendation based on the visual profile . For example the real time recommendation might contain a listing of movies produced by a particular movie studio e.g. Studio A mentioned in the conversation in the communication interface . Additionally the recommended movies may match one or more interests reflected in the visual profile e.g. cycling science particular movie genres and or actors and so forth . Thus the illustrated approach uses both the conversation in the communication interface and the visual profile to generate real time recommendations which may significantly enhance the level of customization to the particular user and effectiveness of the recommendations. Moreover by presenting the visual profile to the user the illustrated approach enables the user to understand the basis for the real time recommendations.

Indeed demonstrate that the user may modify the contents of the visual profile to more accurately reflect the user s likes and dislikes. For example the user might select a particular item in the visual profile for deletion if the item does not reflect the user s tastes and or preferences. In such a case the user may issue a deletion request by selecting a delete option which causes the device to delete the item from the visual profile . Additionally the user may assign a certain sentiment to a particular item in the visual profile . In such a case the user might touch manipulate a slider bar to make a sentiment designation e.g. hot cold that causes the selected sentiment to be assigned to the item . Thus the illustrated approach enables the user to control the content of the visual profile and therefore control the basis of the real time recommendations to the user of the device .

Turning now to a method of generating visual profiles is shown. The method may be implemented in a computing device as a set of logic instructions and or firmware stored in a machine or computer readable medium such as random access memory RAM read only memory ROM programmable ROM PROM flash memory etc. in configurable logic such as for example programmable logic arrays PLAs field programmable gate arrays FPGAs complex programmable logic devices CPLDs in fixed functionality logic hardware using circuit technology such as for example application specific integrated circuit ASIC complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS or transistor transistor logic TTL technology or any combination thereof. For example computer program code to carry out operations shown in the method may be written in any combination of one or more programming languages including an object oriented programming language such as C or the like and conventional procedural programming languages such as the C programming language or similar programming languages. Moreover the method may be implemented using any of the aforementioned circuit technologies.

Illustrated processing block provides for identifying one or more phrases in a conversation between a first user and a second user. The conversation may be a text based conversation such as for example an SMS and or IM conversation a voice based conversation a video based conversation and so forth. In the case of a voice and or video based conversation speech recognition technology may be used to identify the phrases in block . Thus as the users participate in the conversation the content of the conversation may be parsed into one two and three word phrases which may then be stemmed for the removal of stop words such as although before and therefore.

The identified phrases may be validated at block against a natural language corpus. In one example the term frequency inverse document frequency TF IDF may be calculated for each phrase. Generally the TF IDF value may increase proportionally to the number of times a phrase appears in the conversation but is offset by the frequency of the phrase in the corpus which may help to control for the fact that some phrases are generally more common than others. Thus the TF IDF approach may ensure that selected phrases are used regularly by the conversation participants relative to the population at large. Any phrases having a TF IDF value above a certain threshold may be processed further at block to identify one or more social networking pages associated with the phrases. For example the Graph API application programming interface from Facebook may facilitate the identification of social networking pages for various phrases such as band names television shows sports teams etc. Thus the social networking approach may facilitate the selection of phrases that have been validated by society at large.

Illustrated block extracts one or more images from the social networking pages wherein the extracted images may be incorporated into a visual profile for the first user at block . Thus the utterance of the phrase Studio A in a conversation might result in the logo from that particular studio being extracted from the studio s social networking page and added to a visual profile such as for example the visual profile . Similarly the occurrence of the phrase New York skyline in a conversation may result in a photo of the New York City skyline being extracted from the city s social networking page and added to a visual profile such as for example the visual profile .

The method may also provide for presenting the visual profile to the first user receiving input from the first user and modifying the visual profile based on the input. If the input includes a deletion request modifying the visual profile may include deleting one or more items such as the item from the visual profile in response to the deletion request. If on the other hand the input includes a sentiment designation made via an interface such as a slider bar modifying the visual profile may include associating the sentiment designation with one or more items in the visual profile. Indeed the sentiment designation may enable the refinement of results through negation e.g. I want to find a bar that is the opposite of a biker bar .

Illustrated block uses the visual profile of a conversation between the first user and the second user and or other visual profiles of other conversations a group profile associated with multiple users and so forth to select a real time recommendation from the set of candidate recommendations. Thus the visual profile may act as a filter to identify real time recommendations which may be presented to the user at block .

Turning now to a logic architecture is shown in which real time recommendations may be generated based on visual profiles and user conversations. The logic architecture may generally be implemented in a computing device such as for example the device and may involve one or more aspects of the method and or the method already discussed. In the illustrated example a conversation module identifies one or more phrases in a conversation between a first user and a second user and a profile module generates a first visual profile based on the one or more phrases. Additionally a recommendation module may generate a real time recommendation based on the visual profile.

In one example the profile module includes an image unit to use the one or more phrases to obtain one or more images and incorporate the one or more images into the first visual profile and a validation unit to validate the one or more phrases against a natural language corpus. The validation unit may also identify one or more social networking pages associated with the one or more phrases wherein the image unit may extract the one or more images from the one or more social networking pages. Additionally the illustrated logic architecture includes a user interface UI that presents the first visual profile to the first user and receives input from the first user wherein the profile module may modify the first visual profile based on the input. In one example if the input includes a deletion request the profile module includes a deletion unit to delete one or more items from the first visual profile in response to the deletion request. If on the other hand the input includes a sentiment designation the profile module may include a sentiment unit that associates the sentiment designation with one or more items in the first visual profile.

Moreover the profile module may identify metadata associated with a second visual profile for another conversation and or user wherein the real time recommendation is generated further based on the metadata associated with the second visual profile. The illustrated profile module may also share metadata associated with the first visual profile with one or more additional users and formulate group profiles in response to input from the first user.

For example additional processing element s may include additional processors s that are the same as a first processor additional processor s that are heterogeneous or asymmetric to processor a first processor accelerators such as e.g. graphics accelerators or digital signal processing DSP units field programmable gate arrays or any other processing element. There can be a variety of differences between the processing elements in terms of a spectrum of metrics of merit including architectural micro architectural thermal power consumption characteristics and the like. These differences may effectively manifest themselves as asymmetry and heterogeneity amongst the processing elements . For at least one embodiment the various processing elements may reside in the same die package.
