The present Application for Patent is a continuation of patent application Ser. No. 12 376 745 entitled PROCESSING OF A MOBILE TERMINATED DATA OVER SIGNALING MESSAGE filed Feb. 6 2009 pending which is a national stage application of PCT Patent Application No. PCT US2007 079847 filed Sep. 28 2007 which claims priority to Provisional Application No. 60 827 427 entitled METHOD TO PREPARE FOR ORIGINATION BASED UPON RECEIPT OF A MOBILE TERMINATED DATA OVER SIGNALING MESSAGE filed Sep. 28 2006 each assigned to the assignee hereof and each hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.

The present invention generally relates to communications in a wireless environment. More particularly the invention relates to message processing in an access terminal in a wireless communication system.

Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations including a first generation analog wireless phone service 1G a second generation 2G digital wireless phone service including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks and a third generation 3G high speed data Internet capable wireless service. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use including Cellular and Personal Communications Service PCS systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System AMPS and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Time Division Multiple Access TDMA the Global System for Mobile access GSM variation of TDMA and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.

The method for providing CDMA mobile communications was standardized in the United States by the Telecommunications Industry Association Electronic Industries Association in TIA EIA IS 95 A entitled Mobile Station Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System referred to herein as IS 95. Combined AMPS CDMA systems are described in TIA EIA Standard IS 98. Other communications systems are described in the IMT 2000 UM or International Mobile Telecommunications System 2000 Universal Mobile Telecommunications System standards covering what are referred to as wideband CDMA WCDMA CDMA2000 such as CDMA2000 1xEV DO standards for example or TD SCDMA.

In wireless communication systems mobile stations handsets or access terminals receive signals from fixed position base stations also referred to as cell sites or cells that support communication links or service within particular geographic regions adjacent to or surrounding the base stations. Conventionally each mobile station monitors a control channel that can be used to exchange messages between the mobile station and the base station. The control channel is used to transmit system overhead messages whereas traffic channels are conventionally used for substantive communication e.g. voice and data to and from the mobile station. For example the control channel can be used to establish traffic channels control power levels and the like as is known in the art. Generally when a control channel signal has been received by the mobile station communications modem and is being processed by the mobile station the mobile station performs power management by lowering or shutting down power to a communication modem antenna transmitter and or receiver. While this conserves power to the mobile station it may cause problems for delay sensitive applications that will have to wait for the power startup cycle after processing a response to the control channel signal. Therefore system engineers may face a trade off between power conservation and poor responsiveness.

Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are directed to a systems and methods for message processing in an access terminal in a wireless communication system.

Accordingly an embodiment of the invention can include a method comprising detecting a data over signaling DoS message at an access terminal and delaying a sleep state at the access terminal for a predetermined time after detection of the DoS message.

Another embodiment can include an apparatus comprising logic configured to detect a data over signaling DoS message at an access terminal and logic configured to delay a sleep state at the access terminal for a predetermined time after detection of the DoS message.

Another embodiment can include a system comprising means for detecting a data over signaling DoS message at an access terminal and means for delaying a sleep state at the access terminal for a predetermined time after detection of the DoS message.

Another embodiment can include a computer readable media embodying a method for processing messages at an access terminal the method comprising detecting a data over signaling DoS message at the access terminal and delaying a sleep state at the access terminal for a predetermined time after detection of the DoS message.

Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally well known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of embodiments of the invention.

The word exemplary is used herein to mean serving as an example instance or illustration. Any embodiment described herein as exemplary is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise the term embodiments of the invention does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature advantage or mode of operation. Also as used herein the terms mobile station mobile terminal handset access terminal AT wireless device and the like are used interchangeably. The terms sleep and start up as used herein to mean the power management of shutting down all or partial power to the mobile station s modem antenna transmitter and or receiver modules. An AT that is in the sleep mode or sleep state does not monitor the Control Channel or any over the air messages that are transmitted in the network.

Further many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by for example elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits e.g. application specific integrated circuits ASICs by program instructions being executed by one or more processors or by a combination of both. Additionally these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in a number of different forms all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition for each of the embodiments described herein the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as for example logic configured to perform the described action.

A High Data Rate HDR subscriber station referred to herein as an access terminal AT may be mobile or stationary and may communicate with one or more HDR base stations referred to herein as modem pool transceivers MPTs or base stations BS . An access terminal transmits and receives data packets through one or more modem pool transceivers to an HDR base station controller referred to as a modem pool controller MPC base station controller and or mobile switching center MSC . Modem pool transceivers and modem pool controllers are parts of a network called an access network. An access network transports data packets between multiple access terminals. The access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the access network such as a corporate intranet or the Internet and may transport data packets between each access terminal and such outside networks. An access terminal that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is called an active access terminal and is said to be in a traffic state. An access terminal that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is said to be in a connection setup state. An access terminal may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel for example using fiber optic or coaxial cables. An access terminal may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card compact flash external or internal modem or wireless or wireline phone. The communication link through which the access terminal sends signals to the modem pool transceiver is called a reverse link or traffic channel. The communication link through which a modem pool transceiver sends signals to an access terminal is called a forward link or traffic channel. As used herein the term traffic channel can refer to either a forward or reverse traffic channel.

Referring back to the components of the wireless system and interrelation of the elements of embodiments of the invention are not limited to the configuration illustrated. System is merely exemplary and can include any system that allows remote access terminals such as wireless client computing devices to communicate over the air between and among each other and or between and among components connected via the air interface and RAN including without limitation wireless network carrier the Internet and or other remote servers.

The RAN processes and routes messages conventionally sent as data packets sent to a MPC MSC . The carrier network may communicate with the MPC MSC by a network the Internet and or a public switched telephone network PSTN . Alternatively the MPC MSC may connect directly to the Internet or external network. Conventionally the network or Internet connection between the carrier network and the MPC MSC transfers data and the PSTN transfers voice information. The MPC MSC can be connected to multiple base stations BS or modem pool transceivers MPT . In a similar manner to the carrier network the MPC MSC is conventionally connected to the MPT BS by a network the Internet and or PSTN for data transfer and or voice information. The MPT BS can broadcast data messages wirelessly to the access terminals such as cellular telephone . The MPT BS MPC MSC and other components may form the RAN as is known in the art. However alternate configurations may also be used and the invention is not limited to the configuration illustrated.

Referring to the access terminal here a wireless device such as a cellular telephone has a platform that can receive and execute software applications data and or commands transmitted from the RAN that may ultimately come from the carrier network the Internet and or other remote servers and networks. The platform can include a transceiver operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other processor microprocessor logic circuit or other data processing device. The ASIC or other processor executes the application programming interface API layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory of the wireless device. The memory can be comprised of read only or random access memory RAM and ROM EEPROM flash cards or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform also can include a local database that can hold applications not actively used in memory . The local database is conventionally a flash memory cell but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art such as magnetic media EEPROM optical media tape soft or hard disk or the like. The internal platform components can also be operably coupled to external devices such as antenna display push to talk button and keypad among other components as is known in the art.

Accordingly an embodiment of the invention can include an access terminal including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example ASIC memory API and local database may all be used cooperatively to load store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively the functionality may be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore the features of the access terminal in are to be considered merely illustrative and embodiments of the invention are not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.

Accordingly an embodiment of the invention may include an access terminal comprising logic configured to detect a DoS message and logic configured to delay the access terminal from entering a sleep state based on the detection of the DoS message. As discussed above the logic can be embodied in any combination of software and or hardware configured to perform the described functions. For example an application operating on access terminal may include all the logic elements discussed above. Alternatively an application may only contain selected logic elements that interact with one or more other resident applications and or hardware elements e.g. API layer processor ASIC memory and the like containing the remaining logic to perform the functionality describe herein.

The wireless communication between the access terminal and the RAN can be based on different technologies such as code division multiple access CDMA time division multiple access TDMA frequency division multiple access FDMA the Global System for Mobile Communications GSM or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. The data communication is conventionally between the access terminal MPT BS and MPC MSC . The MPC MSC can be connected to multiple data networks such as the carrier network PSTN the Internet a virtual private network and the like thus allowing the access terminal access to a broader communication network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art voice transmission and or data can be transmitted to the access terminals from the RAN.

Since wireless devices are conventionally resource limited in terms of power it is advantageous to set the wireless device s communication modem transceiver and related transmission components into a low power idle state or sleep mode as is known in the art. Conventionally these sleep states can occur even after a control channel or traffic channel message is received from the RAN.

Some systems permit messages including data that may be directed for a specific application and or processing at the access terminal. For example a data over signaling DoS message can be sent by the RAN for use by the access terminal. However even when an access terminal receives a signal such as a DoS message it may go into a sleep state between the time the message is received at the access terminal and the time that an application responds after processing the data from the signal.

For example the 1xEV DO standard allows for delivery of data without the need for bringing up a traffic channel using the Data Over Signaling DoS protocol. Certain high priority applications including group communications Push to Talk PTT applications may use the DoS protocol. For example at PTT system may use a DoS message to initiate a call. Accordingly embodiments of the invention allow the access terminal receiving a DoS message to stay awake in preparation for responding to the DoS message transmitting another DoS message in response to the original DoS message or for returning messages to indicate delivery of messages and the like as discussed in further below.

Referring to a system diagram is illustrated in accordance with embodiments of the invention. An application server can be coupled to packet data serving node PDSN which can function in cooperation with the BSC to receive the message from application server decode the message and forward the appropriate directions to BTSs e.g. and for transmission to one or more access terminals e.g. and . The paging is conventionally generated from the RAN and may be sent from multiple BTSs to identify the targeted access terminal. Likewise the RAN may process a DoS message that was directed to a specific access terminal e.g. .

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that conventionally many elements of the wireless infrastructure work cooperatively to provide services to and from the access terminals. Further the functionality of each of the various elements may be relocated to other elements operably connected to the wireless system without changing the overall functionality. Therefore the invention is not limited to the illustrated configuration. Further the discussion of system elements that may contain the functions of embodiments of the invention is merely for illustrative purposes and should not be construed to limit the embodiments of the invention to the discussed configurations.

Referring to when the DoS message is received at the access terminal the message is first processed at the physical layer and then forwarded to the medium access MAC layer . At the MAC layer the message is decoded to check if it is a DoS message . If the message contains a DoS packet a start sleep delay timer can be initiated that prevents the access terminal from entering a sleep state via sleep delay logic and timer . Preventing the access terminal from entering a sleep state can lead to considerable savings for delay sensitive applications such as group communication applications. In conventional systems the delay between decoding of the DoS packet the receipt of the DoS message at the application layer and application layer response to the communication contained in the packet may cause the access terminal to enter a sleep state which can further delay the ultimate processing and response to the DoS message. However by setting the sleep delay timer the access terminal is prevented from entering a sleep state for a limited time e.g. 50 ms. which prevents additional processing response delays due to the access terminal entering the sleep state and then waking up again. Further upon receipt of multiple DoS messages the time limit can be reset to ensure sufficient time for processing response to the DoS message. However those skilled in the art will appreciate that extending the time limit for delaying the sleep state impacts the battery life of the access terminal and should be set according to the expected processing response delays.

As illustrated in the DoS message can be passed to an application layer from the MAC layer for further processing as is known in the art. In some embodiments DoS packets may be ignored based upon types of DoS packets the number of DoS packets received within a time period whether the application is active or loaded or other type of filtering capability based on the environment of the AT e.g. low battery . Further alternate paths are illustrated from the MAC layer to the application layer to emphasize that embodiments of the invention are not limited to communication between the layers as illustrated and discussed herein.

The application layer may contain applications processes that can use the data contained in the DoS message. Further the application layer may have applications processes that operate independently or in cooperation with other applications processes in the application layer . For example as illustrated in a run time environment e.g. QUALCOMM s Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless BREW may be present that can host a variety of client applications and serve as a platform to allow a consistent interface e.g. via APIs to the features of the access terminal . One of the client applications can include group communication logic e.g. QUALCOMM s QChat for initializing and receiving group communication calls. When responding to the DoS message there will be a processing time e.g. the time for the application to process the DoS message and respond at the application layer . Upon completion of the processing time of the application the sleep delay timer can be reset and the application can take control of the sleep functions e.g. preventing allowing the access terminal to enter the sleep state . Another embodiment may simply signal the sleep delay logic and timer which will then determine when and if to reset the timer which may be dependent on other events in the AT. In yet another embodiment the sleep delay logic and timer may independently decide when and if to reset the timer based on profiles and configuration data regardless of the application layer requests. Accordingly it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that system designers may implement various strategies for improved responsiveness upon receipt of DoS messages using embodiments of the invention while still including system specific design considerations.

As noted above embodiments of the invention can reduce the delays in delay sensitive applications. A group communication system is an example of a delay sensitive system that can take advantage of reduced connection times offered by the embodiments disclosed herein. The group communication system may also be known as a push to talk PTT system a net broadcast service NBS a dispatch system or a point to multi point communication system. Conventionally a group of access terminal users can communicate with one another using an access terminal assigned to each group member. The term group member denotes a group of access terminal users authorized to communicate with each other. Although group communication systems PTT systems may be considered to be among several members the system is not limited to this configuration and can apply to communication between individual devices on a one to one basis.

The group may operate over an existing communications system without requiring substantial changes to the existing infrastructure. Thus a controller and users may operate in any system capable of transmitting and receiving packet information using Internet protocol IP such as a Code Division Multiple Access CDMA system a Time Division Multiple Access TDMA system a Global System for Mobile Communications GSM system satellite communication systems combinations of land line and wireless systems and the like.

Group members may communicate with each other using an assigned access terminal such as ATs and . The ATs may be wireline or wireless devices such as terrestrial wireless telephones wireline telephones having push to talk capability satellite telephones equipped with push to talk functionality laptop or desktop computers paging devices or any combination thereof. Furthermore each AT may be able to send and receive information in either a secure mode or a non secure clear mode. It should be understood that reference to an access terminal AT is not intended to be limited to the illustrated or enumerated examples and may encompass other devices that have the capability to transmit and receive packet information in accordance with the Internet Protocol IP .

When a group member wishes to transmit information to other members of the group the member may request the transmission privilege by pressing a push to talk button or key e.g. in on an AT which generates a request formatted for transmission over a distributed network. For example AT may generate a request to be transmitted over the air to one or more MPTs or base stations . A MPC MSC which may include a well known inter working function IWF packet data serving node PDSN or packet control function PCF for processing data packets may exist between MPT BS and the distributed network. However the requests may also be transmitted through the public switched telephone network PSTN to a carrier network . The carrier network may receive the request and provide it to distributed network .

Referring to one or more group communication servers can monitor traffic of the group communication system through its connection to distributed network. Since group communication server can be connected to the distributed network through a variety of wired and wireless interfaces geographic proximity to group participants is not necessary. Conventionally a group communication server controls communications between the wireless devices of set group members ATs in a PTT system. The wireless network illustrated is merely exemplary and can include any system whereby remote modules communicate over the air between and among each other and or between and among components of a wireless network including without limitation wireless network carriers and or servers. A series of group communication servers can be connected to a group communication server LAN .

The group communication server s can be connected to a wireless service provider s packet data service node PDSN such as PSDN shown here resident on a carrier network . Each PSDN can interface with a base station controller of a base station through a packet control function PCF . The PCF may be located in the base station . The carrier network controls messages generally in the form of data packets sent to a MSC . The MSC can be connected to one or more base stations . In a similar manner to the carrier network the MSC is conventionally connected to the BTS by both the network and or Internet for data transfer and PSTN for voice information. The BTS ultimately broadcasts and receives messages wirelessly to and from the wireless ATs such as cellular telephones as is well known in the art. Accordingly the details of a group communication system will not be further discussed.

In view of the foregoing those skilled in the art will appreciate that embodiments of the invention may be singular devices or include many components. For example at least one embodiment of the invention may include an apparatus including logic configured to detect a data over signaling DoS message at an access terminal and logic configured to delay a sleep state at the access terminal for a predetermined time after detection of the DoS message. At this level the apparatus may be the access terminal itself. However embodiments of the invention are not limited to only this aspect as the apparatus may further include an access network that transmits the DoS message to the access terminal over an air interface. Still further the apparatus may include a group communication server and the DoS message can be generated in response to a message from the group communication server to the access network requesting communication with the access terminal. Accordingly embodiments of the invention can encompass both the individual elements and a system for group communication as discussed in the foregoing.

Those of skill in the art will appreciate that information and signals may be represented using any of a variety of different technologies and techniques. For example data instructions commands information signals bits symbols and chips that may be referenced throughout the above description may be represented by voltages currents electromagnetic waves magnetic fields or particles optical fields or particles or any combination thereof.

Further those of skill in the art will appreciate that the various illustrative logical blocks modules circuits and algorithm steps described in connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented as electronic hardware computer software or combinations of both. To clearly illustrate this interchangeability of hardware and software various illustrative components blocks modules circuits and steps have been described above generally in terms of their functionality. Whether such functionality is implemented as hardware or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system. Skilled artisans may implement the described functionality in varying ways for each particular application but such implementation decisions should not be interpreted as causing a departure from the scope of the present invention.

The various illustrative logical blocks modules and circuits described in connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented or performed with a general purpose processor a digital signal processor DSP an application specific integrated circuit ASIC a field programmable gate array FPGA or other programmable logic device discrete gate or transistor logic discrete hardware components or any combination thereof designed to perform the functions described herein. A general purpose processor may be a microprocessor but in the alternative the processor may be any conventional processor controller microcontroller or state machine. A processor may also be implemented as a combination of computing devices e.g. a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor a plurality of microprocessors one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a DSP core or any other such configuration.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that embodiments of the invention include methods for performing the functions processes sequences and or algorithms described herein. For example referring to an embodiment of the invention may include a method including detecting a data over signaling DoS message at an access terminal and delaying a sleep state at the access terminal for a predetermined time upon detection of the DoS message. Further the process of delaying the sleep state can include many variations such as those discussed herein and embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific features of the sleep state delay function.

For example the delaying the sleep state can include activating a sleep timer and preventing the sleep state while the sleep delay timer is active e.g. not timed out . However other considerations may alter the duration of the sleep state delay and or initiation of the sleep state. For example the sleep delay timer may be reset deactivated after an application receives the DoS message . As discussed above once an application has received the DoS message it can reset deactivate the sleep delay timer and or disable the sleep state entirely as designated by the system designers.

Alternatively if an application does not take control of the sleep delay process and a subsequent DoS message is received the sleep delay timer may be restarted to allow the predetermined time e.g. 50 ms to elapse for the subsequent DoS message. This will provide the opportunity for an application to receive and process the subsequent DoS message regardless of how close the system is to timing out from the previous DoS message.

Additionally as discussed in the foregoing a packet can be received at a physical layer and then decoded at a medium access MAC layer to detect if it contains the DoS message. The DoS message can be forwarded to the application layer for further processing by an application e.g. PTT . The sleep delay allows time for the application to receive and process the DoS message before the access terminal enters a sleep state which could further delay the response to processing of the DoS message. However the sleep state delay can be limited e.g. timed out to prevent excessive batter drain even if the application does not respond.

The methods sequences and or algorithms described in connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be embodied directly in hardware in a software module executed by a processor or in a combination of the two. A software module may reside in RAM memory flash memory ROM memory EPROM memory EEPROM memory registers hard disk a removable disk a CD ROM or any other form of storage medium known in the art. An exemplary storage medium is coupled to the processor such that the processor can read information from and write information to the storage medium. In the alternative the storage medium may be integral to the processor. The processor and the storage medium may reside in an ASIC. The ASIC may reside in a user terminal e.g. access terminal . In the alternative the processor and the storage medium may reside as discrete components in a user terminal.

Accordingly an embodiment of the invention can include a computer readable media embodying methods to perform the functionalities described herein. For example an embodiment can include a computer readable media embodying a method for processing messages at an access terminal the method comprising detecting a data over signaling DoS message at an access terminal and delaying a sleep state at the access terminal for a predetermined time after detection of the DoS message. Other embodiments can include a system comprising means for detecting a data over signaling DoS message at an access terminal and means for delaying a sleep state at the access terminal for a predetermined time after detection of the DoS message. Accordingly the invention is not limited to the illustrated examples and any means for performing the functionalities sequence of actions and or algorithms described herein are included in embodiments of the invention.

While the foregoing disclosure shows illustrative embodiments of the invention it should be noted that various changes and modifications could be made herein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. The functions steps and or actions of the method claims in accordance with the embodiments of the invention described herein need not be performed in any particular order. Furthermore although elements of the invention may be described or claimed in the singular the plural is contemplated unless limitation to the singular is explicitly stated.
