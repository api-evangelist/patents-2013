Compared with the prior art the disclosure has advantages. In the disclosure the geographic candidate word matching with the coded character string and the geographic position information is recommended to the user according to comprehensive influence on the candidate word from the inputted coded character string and the geographic position information corresponding to the coded character string. Furthermore the geographic candidate word is obtained by retrieving in the geographic word stock of the geographic area in which the geographic position information is located and the geographic word stock of the geographic area is used for storing the coded character string and the corresponding geographic word. Therefore the geographic candidate word of the geographic area in which the user is located can be recommended according to the geographic position information that is the candidate word required by the user can be displayed in an inputting process and therefore the intelligence of input methods can be improved and complexity of inputting of the user can be reduced.

Furthermore in the disclosure when an association degree of the application program environment information and the geographic position matches with the preset association degree conditions an input requirement of the user on the geographic candidate word is confirmed and a function of the input method for recommending the user with the geographic candidate word of the geographic area in which the user is located can be activated. The disclosure is additionally provided with a function of judging input requirements of the user and can recommend the geographic candidate word of the geographic area in which the user is located according to the geographic position information. Accordingly embodiments of this disclosure can display the candidate word required by the user in a inputting process so as to be capable of improving the intelligence of input methods.

This Summary is not intended to identify all key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used alone as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

The disclosure is described below with reference to the accompanying drawings and embodiments in detail in order to make the purpose characteristics and advantages of this disclosure more clear.

Under current technologies input contents associated with geographic position information cannot be intelligently provided for users. For example a user downloads a Hangzhou City of China dialect packet and then inputs zsj to seek a candidate word of Zhangshengji i.e. a restaurant name when shopping in a mall in No. 701 Fuchun Road Jianggan District of Hangzhou. However a geographic name of Zhusanjiao i.e. Pearl River Delta would be displayed under current technologies providing no benefit to the user. As a result the user has to precisely typing the whole spelling of Zhangshengji to obtain the candidate word of Zhangshengji therefore increasing complexity of inputting.

At a computing device e.g. a user device or a server may receive a coded character string from a user. At the computing device may collect geographic position information corresponding to the coded character string. At the computing device may determine a geographic area in which the geographic position information is located.

At the computing device may retrieve and or obtain a geographic candidate word corresponding to the coded character string according to a geographic word stock of the determined geographic area. In these instances the geographic word stock of the geographic area is used for storing the coded character string and a corresponding geographic word according to the geographic area. At the computing device may display the geographic candidate word.

The disclosure can be applied to various scenes of input contents associated with the geographic positions according to requirements of users. For example a user needs to tell friends about a name of a market when shopping in the market of Dongcheng District of Beijing. The user may input e.g. type a coded character string of dfxtd in a short message service SMS window so that a geographic word of Dongfangxintiandi in the geographic area in which the user is located is automatically recommended according to the user s geographic position information.

For another example the user sees a restaurant of Zhangshengji and wants to search for reviews of the restaurant when shopping in a mall in No. 701 Fuchun Road Jianggan District of Hangzhou. The user may type zsj in dianping.com and then a geographic word of the Zhangshengji in the geographic area in which the user is located may be automatically recommended according to the user s geographic position information.

For yet another example the user needs to search locations of some scenic spots when touring in Lijiang to search Ishh in a map. As a result a geographic word of Lashihai in the geographic area in which the user is located is automatically recommended according to the user s geographic position information.

In general a desired input method not only understands users input content but also grasps their intent and then provides various options based on the input content and intent. However using current technologies the candidate word is limited in two aspects namely a geographic name and a dialect. Therefore influence of a geographic position in which the user is located on the input requirements of the user may not be considered. In addition the input requirements of the user cannot be intelligently known and thus a candidate word desired by the user may not be displayed.

To intelligently know input requirements of a user embodiments of this disclosure recommend a geographic candidate word to the user according to comprehensive influence of an inputted coded character string and the geographic position information corresponding to the coded character string. The geographic candidate word matches with the coded character string and the geographic position information. Furthermore the geographic candidate word is obtained by retrieving in a geographic word stock of a geographic area in which the geographic position information is located. The geographic word stock of the geographic area may store the coded character string and the corresponding geographic word. Therefore in the disclosure the geographic candidate word of the geographic area in which the user is located according to the geographic position information can be recommended. The candidate word desired by the user can be displayed in the input process and the intelligence of the input method can be improved.

The geographic position information corresponding to a coded character string may be geographic position information of a user when the user inputs the coded character string. In some embodiments the corresponding geographic position information can be collected according to the Internet Protocol IP address the mobile device Global Positioning System GPS or the mobile network of a user based on a coded character string of the user. The disclosure does not limit a method for collecting the geographic position information corresponding to the coded character string.

The disclosure provides a method for determining the geographic area in which the geographic position is located. In some embodiments a geographic position information range e.g. a longitude and latitude range of the geographic area can be pre stored. The geographic position information is matched with the pre stored geographic position range of the geographic area. For example if the longitude of the existing geographic position information is larger than an initial value of the GPS longitude of the pre stored geographic area and the longitude of the existing geographic position information is smaller than an end value of the GPS longitude of the pre stored geographic area and the latitude of the existing geographic position information is larger than an initial value of the GPS latitude of the pre stored geographic area and the latitude of the existing geographic position information is smaller than an end value of the GPS latitude of the pre stored geographic area then the geographic area of the existing geographic position information can be determined to be successfully matched with the pre stored geographic area.

In some embodiments the geographic area can be queried in various geographic service websites according to the geographic information. In sum the disclosure does not limit the method for determining the geographic area in which the geographic position is located. Those skilled in the art can regulate the fine granularity of a geographic area according to actual requirements. For example the fine granularity of the geographic area can include a province city district street community and the like for a city and the fine granularity of the geographic area can include a province city county town village and the like for a country.

In some embodiments the geographic word stock of the geographic area may store a coded character string and a corresponding geographic word according to a geographic area. Therefore the mapping relationship of the coded character string and the geographic word can be established and be saved in a corresponding geographic word stock.

Table 1 shows an example of the disclosure of a storage structure of the geographic word stock of the geographic area and describes the geographic word stock of the urban area of Hangzhou. The corresponding storage structure specifically can include the coded character string and the geographic word.

In some embodiments if the coded character string inputted by the user is zsj and the user is determined to be located in the urban area of Hangzhou according to the geographic position information in which the user is located the candidate word of Zhangshengji corresponding to the coded character string can be obtained by retrieving in the geographic word stock of the urban area of Hangzhou. Under current technologies the user will obtain the candidate word of Zhangshengji by inputting the whole spelling of zhangshengji . However this disclosure can effectively reduce the complexity of an input of a user as compared with the current technologies.

In some embodiments the geographic word stock of the geographic area can be constructed various ways. For example a computing device may count a utilization frequency of a geographic word in a geographic area and collect the geographic word of which the counting result meets the preset utilization frequency conditions. The computing device may then store the collected geographic word and the corresponding coded character string in the geographic word stock of the geographic area.

Generally the higher a utilization frequency of a geographic word in a geographic area is the higher an association degree of a personal or object name corresponding to the geographic word and the geographic area is. Thus the personal or object name corresponding to the geographic word is widely utilized. In some instances the personal or object name becomes one of the signs of the geographic area under some conditions. For example the association degrees of the Dongfangxintiandi and the Dongcheng District of Beijing the Zhangshengji and the Hangzhou and the Lashihai and the Lijiang in the application scenes are high. For another example the association degree of the Jinguigui Street and the Gui Street of Beijing is high and the like.

In some embodiments when a utilization frequency is matched with a corresponding preset utilization frequency condition the corresponding geographic word may be collected and saved in a geographic word stock of a corresponding geographic area. The corresponding preset utilization frequency condition includes a condition matching with a counted object the geographic word in the geographic area in this disclosure a specifically utilized counting method and or a counting environment and the like. Generally a ratio of utilization times of a counted object to the utilization times of all counted objects in a counting environment is taken as a corresponding utilization frequency.

In some embodiments a computing device may obtain a geographic word in a geographic area by searching the geographic word of the geographic area from Internet information according to geographic position category i.e. Solution A1 . In some embodiments the computing device may obtain a geographic word in a geographic area by recording a displayed trigging condition word when a user inputs the triggering condition word and displays on a screen i.e. Solution A2 . In these instances the triggering condition word is a preset geographic word of the geographic area according to the geographic position category.

In some embodiments geographic position categories may be configured. For example the geographic position categories can include one or more of the following categories business areas restaurants clubs hotels supermarkets theatres scenic spots schools banks and gymnasiums.

If the geographic word and corresponding geographic position information are in a restaurant category in Zhongguancun District restaurants in Zhongguancun District can be searched on the website such as dianping.com and or meishi.qq.com. If the geographic word is in a business area category in the Dongcheng District of Beijing business areas in Dongcheng District of Beijing can be searched on a website associated with the business area or map searching service websites.

In some embodiments some recording triggering conditions can be configured in a client of the input method and are used for recording and triggering. For example the client is provided with a module for storing triggering condition words and triggering the input method to record a displayed word when the displayed word inputted by the user is matched with the module.

In some embodiments users can preset geographic words in a geographic area to be as triggering condition words according to the geographic position category. The disclosure does not limit a specific triggering condition word presetting method.

In some embodiments the geographic word in the geographic area is obtained according to history input words of the users of the input method so that the geographic words stored in the geographic word of the geographic area can be matched with users habits and the geographic candidate word recommended to the users can be also matched with the habits of the most of the users in the geographic area. Therefore intelligence of the input method can be further improved.

For example A B C and D are residents in Mudanyuan district. Each of A B and C inputs e.g. typing a coded character string of jbchw in the Mudanyuan District to mean Jiangbianchengwai . However if a word stock of another user D does not store the word of Jiangbianchengwai the candidate word of Jiangbianchengwai can be also recommended to the D when the D inputs the coded character string of jbchw in the Mudanyuan district according to this disclosure.

In some embodiments when the Solution A and or the Solution A are is utilized an counting environment of a utilization frequency can include environments corresponding to one or more of geographic position categories relative to the Solution A environments corresponding to one or more of geographic position categories relative to the Solution A or environments corresponding to one or more of geographic position categories relative to the Solution A and the Solution A.

For example in the Solution A the geographic word of Jiangbianchengwai in the Mudanyuan District is obtained. Thus when the utilization frequency of the Jiangbianchengwai is counted the inputting times of the Jiangbianchengwai of the user of the input method can be taken as the numerator. The times of one or more of corresponding geographic words in the all geographic position categories obtained by the Solution A can be also taken as the denominator. In addition the times of one or more of corresponding geographic words in the all geographic position categories obtained by the Solution A and the Solution A can be taken as the denominator. This disclosure does not limit specific counting environments of the utilization frequency.

Furthermore corresponding to the utilized counting manner the corresponding preset utilization frequency conditions can be used for judging the degree of the utilization frequency. For example an embodiment of a preset utilization frequency condition is that the utilization frequency is larger than 0.05 and the like.

In some embodiments a computing device may retrieve a geographic candidate word corresponding to a coded character string according to a determined geographic word stock of a geographic region. The computing device may retrieve the geographic candidate word corresponding to the coded character string from the geographic word stock of the determined geographic area of a client. In these instances the computing device may transmit the coded character string and the geographic position information to a server terminal which is used for retrieving the geographic candidate word corresponding to the coded character string from the geographic word stock of the determined geographic area.

In some embodiments the computing device may further analyze an attribute of a geographic position of an unmatched displayed character when the displayed character or phrase inputted by the user is not matched with the geographic word stock of the determined geographic area. Then the computing device may synchronize the unmatched character serving as a geographic word into the geographic word stock of the corresponding geographic area of each client terminal when the attribute of the geographic position is analyzed to be matched with the preset geographic position attribution conditions.

In some embodiments a computing device may analyze the attribute of the geographic position of the unmatched character by collecting the corresponding geographic position information of the unmatched character. The computing device may then determine the corresponding geographic position range of the geographic position information and count the frequency of the unmatched character within the corresponding geographic position range. If the counted frequency is matched with the preset geographic position attribute conditions for example the frequency is larger than a threshold of 0.2 the computing device may determine that the unmatched character is a geographic word and synchronize the geographic word to the geographic word stock of the corresponding geographic area of each client terminal.

In some embodiments the client or the server terminal can be used for carrying out an operation of analyzing an attribute of a geographic position of an unmatched character. For example when the client terminal determines that the displayed character of the user is not matched with the geographic word stock of the determined geographic area the client terminal can select to carry out the operation of analyzing the attribute of the geographic position of the unmatched character. The client terminal may transmit the unmatched character as a geographic word into the server terminal when the analyzed attribute of the geographic position is matched with a preset geographic position attribute condition. Then the server terminal carries out a corresponding synchronization operation.

In some embodiments when the client terminal determines that the displayed character of the user is not matched with a geographic word stock of a determined geographic area the client terminal can select to transmit the unmatched character into the server terminal. Then the server terminal carries out corresponding analysis and synchronization operations. In sum the disclosure aims to enable all clients to use the newest geographic word stock of the geographic area so that the geographic word stock of the geographic area can catch up changes of personal or object names of a certain geographic area. For example when a new restaurant of Waipojia is opened in the certain geographic area users in the geographic area can enjoy a corresponding geographic word recommending service of this restaurant and can immediately enjoy the intelligence of the input method.

In some embodiments a geographic word stock of a geographic area can be further used for storing a coded character string the corresponding geographic position information of the geographic area and the corresponding geographic word. A computing device may retrieve a geographic candidate word corresponding to the coded character string and the geographic position information according to the geographic word stock of the determined geographic area.

Table 2 shows an embodiment of the disclosure of a storage structure of the geographic word stock of the geographic area and describes the geographic word stock of the urban area of Hangzhou. In some embodiments the corresponding storage structure can include the coded character string the geographic word a GPS longitude start field a GPS longitude end field a GPS latitude start field a GPS latitude end field and or the like. In these instances a GPS longitude and latitude range formed by the GPS longitude start field the GPS longitude end field the GPS latitude start field and the GPS latitude end field are used for showing the geographic position information.

In one embodiment of the disclosure if the coded character string inputted by the user is zsj the corresponding geographic position information of the coded character string is east longitude of 120.19424 and northern latitude of 30.26383. Therefore the geographic position information is determined to belong to the urban area of Hangzhou. To obtain a geographic candidate word corresponding to the coded character string and the geographic position information a computing device may respectively match the coded character string of zsj and the geographic position information of east longitude of 120.19424 northern latitude of 30.26383 with corresponding fields of the geographic word stock.

For example the geographic position information matching conditions can include the current geographic position information longitude that is larger than an initial value of the GPS longitude in the geographic word stock the current geographic position information longitude is smaller than an end value of the GPS longitude in the geographic word stock the current geographic position information latitude is larger than an initial value of the GPS latitude in the geographic word stock and the current geographic position information latitude is smaller than an end value of the GPS latitude in the geographic word stock.

The current geographic position information e.g. east longitude of 120.194245 northern latitude of 30.26383 can be judged to be within the longitude and latitude range of the geographic word of Zhangshengji east longitude of 120.19423

The coded character string of zsj is also matched with the coded character string of the geographic word stock and thus the geographic word of Zhangshengji is matched. Therefore under the current technologies the user can obtain the candiate word of Zhangshengji only if inputting the whole spelling of Zhangshengji. However embodiments of this disclosure have advantages of capability of effectively reducing the complexity of an input of a user as compared to the current technologies.

In some embodiments a geographic word stock of a geographic area can be constructed by counting a utilization frequency of the geographic word in the geographic area and collecting the geographic word of which the utilization frequency meets a corresponding preset utilization frequency condition according to a counting result. In addition the collected geographic word the corresponding geographic position information and the corresponding coded character string in the geographic word stock of the geographic area may be stored.

In some embodiments a computing device may obtain the geographic word in the geographic area and the corresponding geographic position information via various solutions. For example the computing device may collect the geographic word of the geographic area and the corresponding geographic position information from Internet information according to a geographic position category i.e. Solution B . The computing device may collect the geographic position information of a triggering condition word when the user inputs the triggering condition word and displays the triggering condition word and record the displayed triggering condition word wherein the triggering condition word is a preset geographic word of the geographic area according to the geographic position category i.e. Solution B .

Embodiments of this disclosure include two geographic word stocks of the geographic area 1 for storing the coded character string and the corresponding geographic word according to the geographic area and 2 for storing the coded character string the corresponding geographic position information of the geographic area and the corresponding geographic word. Regarding these geographic word stocks the coded character string is taken as an index in the first geographic word stock and the coded character string and the geographic position information are taken as the index in the second geographic word stock.

In addition those skilled in the art can respectively configure the fine granularity of the corresponding geographic area according to any one of the two geographic word stocks of the geographic areas and the disclosure does not limit the specific use manners.

At the computing device may retrieve a geographic candidate word corresponding to the coded character string according to a geographic word stock of the determined geographic area when the association degree of the application program environment information and the geographic position meets preset association degree conditions. In some instances the geographic word stock of the geographic area is used for storing the coded character string and the corresponding geographic word according to the geographic area. At the computing device may display the geographic candidate word.

In some embodiments the geographic candidate word of the geographic area in which the user is located is recommended to the user under a suitable occasion. In these instances when an association degree of the application program environment information and the geographic position is matched with the preset association degree conditions the computing device may activate a function of the input method for recommending the geographic candidate word of the geographic area in which the user is located to the user. However when the association degree of the application program environment information and the geographic position is not matched with the preset association degree conditions the recommending function is not activated.

Host programs and boarding programs are concepts in the technical field and are described in principle. A host program can be configured to provide software environment namely host environment in which the boarding program needs to survive under the computer environment. And the host environment can further dynamically download a Dynamic Link Library DLL provided by the boarding program so as to dynamically load external functions. In some embodiments the DLL provided by the boarding program can include an input method editor linkage library e.g. SogouPy.ime stored under c windows system32 and the like provided by an input method.

In an operating system such as Windows UNIX and Linux as the host program each application program can select whether the input method is opened or not and a program handle is transferred to the input method when the input method is opened. For the input method the application program environment information of the current application program can be obtained according to the program handle. For example the input method may invoke GetModuleFilename to find out a program path name of C ProgramFiles MicrosoftOffice OFFICE11 WINWORD.EXE during an operation so as to determine that the corresponding application program environment information is WinWord.exe that is the current coded string is inputted in MICROSOFT WORD .

In some embodiments users can collect some application programs that need to use the input method and can pre configure an association degree of the application program and the geographic position. Therefore the association degree of the application program and the geographic position are mainly applied to showing a probability of the association of character input in the application program and the geographic position. If the association degree of the application program and the geographic position is lower the association degree of the character input in the application program and the geographic position is judged to be lower so that the probability of the user in input requirements of the geographic word is judged to be lower. Therefore the significance of recommendation of the geographic word of the geographic area in which the user is located to the user is low. Otherwise if the association degree of the application program and the geographic position is higher the probability of the association of the character input in the application program and the geographic position is higher so that the probability of the user in the input requirements of the geographic word is larger. Therefore the candidate word required by the user can be recommended to the user in the input process from the geographic words of the geographic area in which the user is located and the intelligence of the input method can be improved.

An association degree of the application program and the geographic position may be pre configured. In some embodiments an application program using the input method can be classified. For example categories of the application program using the input method can include a map application periphery search mobile phone browser general search micro blog shopping type instant communication window game operating system tool and the like.

Table 3 shows an embodiment of the disclosure of the association degree of the category of the application program using the input method and the corresponding geographic position.

In some embodiments an association degree of the application program and the geographic position can be judged by utilizing a preset association degree condition. The preset association degree condition can utilize a quantum condition and can also utilize a grade condition. For example the association degree of the application program and the geographic position is larger than 0.3 and the grade condition is that the association degree of the application program and the geographic position is intermediate or high.
