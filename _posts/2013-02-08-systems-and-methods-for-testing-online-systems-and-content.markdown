This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 597 156 filed Feb. 9 2012 the entire disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present disclosure generally relates to the field of computerized data processing and monitoring techniques. More particularly and without limitation the disclosure relates to computer implemented methods and systems for generating data associated with web pages and web content and for analyzing the generated data to ensure compliance with online privacy regulations.

Online advertising has become a billion dollar industry in today s digital content driven economy. The portability of digital content using mobile computing devices such as smart phones and media players has expanded the reach of online advertisers beyond traditional personal computer users. Advertisers and publishers of online content however desire accurate estimates of the performance of advertisements such as the performance of a particular advertisement associated with a specific location on a website in order to ensure effective ad placement.

Many advertisers and publishers of online content may therefore implement ad tracking systems or methods to monitor consumer behavior and generate accurate demographic profiles of consumers that view specific web sites and respond to certain advertisements. For example advertisers and publishers of online content may utilize tracking or browser cookies that collect information on a consumer s browsing habits which enable the targeting of specific advertisements and online content to the consumer based on his or her browsing habits.

With the growing volume of daily Internet traffic many consumers now view of the presence of such tracking and monitoring techniques as a threat to their privacy and security. Due to this reaction governmental entities and self regulatory bodies now require advertisers and publishers of online content to protect consumer privacy by complying with various restrictions on their tracking and monitoring activities. For example advertisers and publishers of online content may be required to provide consumers with an opportunity to opt out of behavioral monitoring and tracking activity to limit data collection on sites geared to children and to limit sharing of collected data with third parties. However the increasing of content available across the Internet and the increasing number of web pages makes it increasingly difficult for advertisers and publishers of online content to cost effectively monitor their compliance with these privacy and security policies.

In view of the foregoing there is a need for improved systems and methods for ensuring the compliance of an advertiser or content provider with governmental and self regulatory privacy and security policies. There is also a need for improved systems and methods for monitoring the performance of opt out systems required under these privacy regulations. Such systems and methods may be implemented in computer based environments such as the Internet and network environments that provide online content and or services to users.

Communications network may represent any form or medium of digital data communication. Examples of communication network include a local area network LAN a wireless LAN e.g. a WiFi network a wireless Metropolitan Area Network MAN that connects multiple wireless LANs a wide area network WAN e.g. the Internet and a dial up connection e.g. using a V.90 protocol or a V.92 protocol . In the embodiments described herein the Internet may include any publicly accessible network or networks interconnected via one or more communication protocols including but not limited to hypertext transfer protocol HTTP and transmission control protocol internet protocol TCP IP . Moreover communications network may also include one or more mobile device networks such as a GSM network or a PCS network that allow mobile devices such as client device to send and receive data via applicable communications protocols including those described above.

User workstation may include for example a personal computer a laptop a handheld computer a personal digital assistant PDA a mobile device a single server or a component thereof or any other computing platform capable of executing a web browser e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer Apple Safari and Mozilla Firefox and receiving cookies storing cookies and or facilitating state management. Although only a single user workstation is illustrated in environment may include a plurality of such user workstations each of which is associated with a different or unique user.

A user at user workstation may choose to opt out from having his or her usage patterns and web preferences collected for purposes of targeted or behavioral advertising programs implemented by for example advertising system . As further described below the user may opt out to maintain his or her privacy by enrolling in an opt out system such as opt out system . In an embodiment the opt out system may prevent the user from being part of one or more advertising systems targeted advertising programs and also prevent user workstation from receiving associated targeting or tracking cookies from advertising system .

Advertising system may include a personal computer a single server or a component thereof multiple servers arranged as part of an integrated or distributed system a server farm a network of servers etc. Advertising system may correspond to or be part of one or more advertising networks that provide online advertising. Advertising system may include one or more servers or components for transmitting and receiving cookies and additionally or alternatively facilitating state management. Additionally advertising system may include one or more servers or components for delivering online advertisements such a plurality servers that are part of a content delivery network. While only a single advertising system is illustrated in it will be appreciated that the exemplary environment may including a plurality of advertising systems that are owned or operated by one or more entities. Further there may be one or more opt out systems wherein each opt out system is associated with one or more advertising systems that use cookies and any additional or alternative state management mechanism e.g. HTML5 .

Advertising system may be configured to transmit targeting or tracking cookies to user workstations of users that have not opted out from receiving such cookies. These and other types of cookies may be transmitted when a user visits and browses one or more websites in for example an advertising network. As described above cookies stored on non opted out users workstations may allow the advertising system to track online usage and user preferences to transmit targeted advertising. In contrast for users that have elected to opt out from such cookies no such targeting or tracking cookies may be utilized and as a result a user s workstation of an opt out user may only receive general or non targeted advertisements.

To opt out from receiving targeting or tracking cookies from one or more advertising systems a user may execute a web browser e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer Apple Safari or Mozilla Firefox on user workstation . Through browser the user may navigate to a website associated with opt out system . Once connected through network the website of opt out system may be displayed to the user in browser including web pages with various opt out options.

By way of example the user may select elements on pages of the website displayed in browser to opt out from receiving targeted advertisements from one or more advertising systems . For instance a list of different advertising systems or networks may be displayed to the user in browser . Additionally or optionally each listed advertising system or network may have a corresponding status. The status may indicate what kind of cookie e.g. active cookie opt out cookie no cookie if any user workstation has previously received and stored. Based on the list the user may elect to opt out user workstation for one or more advertising systems that use targeting or tracking cookies.

Based on the opt out options selected by a user opt out system may then send instructions to advertising system to cause advertising system to create and send an opt out cookie to user workstation . In response advertising system may create and send an opt out cookie to user workstation . Opt out system may then display a message to the user in browser whether user workstation was successfully opted out from each advertising system or network that the user selected.

The disclosed embodiments are not limited to such exemplary opt out techniques. In a further embodiment and in response to the opt out options selected by the user opt out system may delete tracking information associated with the user. Opt out system may then replace the deleted tracking information with opt out information e.g. an opt out cookie or flag which may be visible to and respected by advertising system . As described above opt out system may then display a message to the user in browser indicating whether user workstation was successfully opted out from the selected advertising system or network.

After user workstation receives an opt out cookie from an advertising system the advertising system may not be able to track the activities of user workstation when a user visits a website in the advertising network s associated with advertising system i.e. advertising system does not collect data identifying the user s activity . In additional embodiments the receipt of the opt out cookie by user workstation may enable advertising system to collect information identifying the activities of the user and generate corresponding profiles while preventing advertising server from providing targeted advertisements to the user.

Whenever browser visits a website in the advertising network of advertising system user workstation may send a request such as for a banner ad or other file to advertising system . Along with the request browser will transmit any previously stored cookies associated with advertising system . If user workstation has an opt out cookie corresponding to the advertising network of advertising system the opt out cookie e.g. with a value of optout will be transmitted back to the advertising system . Advertising system may determine based on the opt out cookie that user workstation has opted out of targeted advertising programs and therefore determine not to use targeting or tracking cookies to track any activity or behavior of the user of user workstation . As a result only untargeted ads may be transmitted to user workstation .

Test system may include a personal computer a single server or a component thereof multiple servers arranged as part of an integrated or distributed system a server farm a network of multiple servers etc. Test system may also be adapted to run or emulate different workstations and operating systems as well as web browsers e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer Apple Safari Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome . When implemented test system may automatically test whether an opt out system operates properly and in accordance with the privacy preferences of the user at user workstation . Among other things test system may send requests to opt out system and advertising system through network . Test system may also receive streams from opt out system and advertising system through network . In such embodiments the received streams may represent network protocol information transmitted between devices across network which includes but is not limited to HTTP or HTTPS messages.

Consistent with embodiments of the present disclosure test system may run a series of different tests periodically or at a predetermined interval e.g. every hour . Settings of test system may be configured before each test or series of different tests to simulate and analyze for example certain environmental conditions. Environmental conditions may include but are not limited to different privacy settings different browsers variations in computer host files e.g. that may manage DNS settings the presence of different anti spyware software changing locations of test system different existing cookies present on test system and modifications of Uniform Resource Locator URL and header values such as user agent or do not track DNT signals.

Consistent with embodiments of the present disclosure test system may simulate new environmental conditions after a series of different tests are completed. In addition test system may repeat or rerun the series of different tests with the new environmental conditions. Test system may also simulate a plurality of different environmental conditions during each interval and run a series of different tests for each one of the environmental conditions.

In running a series of different tests test system may test that one or more opt out system are functioning properly. As described above each opt out system may allow a user to opt out from receiving targeted advertising and associated cookies from one or more advertising systems . Testing opt out system may ensure among other things that a user can access and successfully complete or enroll in the opt out process and that each of the opt out portals or systems e.g. opt out system are in mutual agreement regarding the opt out status of the user e.g. that of the opt out systems or networks does not report the user is being tracked while another of the opt out systems or networks reports the user is opted out .

To conduct a test of opt out system test system may send one or more requests to opt out system . Each request may represent one or more requests in the form that a browser would send to opt out system . In other words test system may emulate requests from the browser of a user who is trying to opt out through a website associated with opt out system . Parameters of a request may differ based on the test and the environmental conditions. Among other things a test may check that the website of opt out system is functioning check that web pages e.g. opt out pages privacy policy page opt out links pages etc. of the website are operating properly check that links between the web pages of the website are operating properly check that necessary elements to selectively opt out from various advertising networks or systems are present on the related web pages and check that if a user were to select any elements e.g. an element to opt out from an advertising network that the opt out system would respond appropriately.

Test system may receive a stream back from opt out system in response to the request s transmitted from test system . A stream may include one or more files a text string a character a numerical value a code etc. Streams may be generated by opt out system after processing requests received from test system . Test system may receive multiple individual streams in response to a single request. The number of streams received by test system from each opt out system may vary based on the number of requests that are transmitted. In one embodiment test system may selectively receive or process only the streams test system needs to determine an outcome of a test. Selectively receiving a stream may include determining whether the stream is necessary to determine the outcome of the test and receiving or processing the stream only when the determination is positive.

Test system may analyze a stream to identify relevant content within the stream that is desired to determine the outcome of a test. Test system may perform any desired analysis and or measurement of the identified content to determine the outcome of a test. For example test system may determine that a website web page associated with opt out system is functioning when a stream is received in the form of a specific response such as an HTTP 200 OK result code which indicates individually or with information provided in the response that the HTTP request has succeeded.

In accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure test system may perform one or more tests as part of a series of different tests to determine whether opt out system or advertising system properly recognizes the cookies stored on test system . Test system may create or may cause to be created e.g. through the generation of an appropriate instruction or command different types of cookies e.g. advertising network cookie opt out cookie no cookie . Test system may send a request to opt out system for opt out system to identify the types of cookies stored on test system . Test system may receive a stream from opt out system including identification of a type of cookie stored on test system for a particular advertising network or advertising system . Test system may also test whether opt out system correctly identifies the type of cookies stored on test system on a website associated with opt out system . Test system may further test that the correct indicator for identifying a type of cookie is properly displayed or otherwise indicated on a website associated with opt out system . In accordance with an embodiment test system may test that the indicator is properly displayed by running a checksum on an image file of the indicator or by applying one or more pattern or image recognition algorithms to the image file.

In accordance with additional embodiments test system may perform one or more tests to determine whether opt out system properly interacts with each corresponding advertising system . Test system may also perform one or more tests to determine whether each advertising system is responding correctly to the interaction with opt out system . To perform a test relating to the interaction of opt out system and an advertising system test system may send a request for opt out system to prompt an advertising system to run a script. Thereafter the advertising system may run the script to create an opt out cookie and send the opt out cookie to test system . The request simulates a selection by a user to opt out test system from the advertising network associated with the advertising system .

In additional embodiments opt out system may be configured to generate as opt out cookie which may be recognized and respected by advertising system . In such embodiments to perform the test relating to the interaction of opt out system and an advertising system test system may send an additional request for opt out system to run a script to create the opt out cookie and send the opt out cookie to test system .

Test system may send a request to opt out system to test that only the advertising systems corresponding to advertising networks that are selected for the opt out process and that are prompted to create opt out cookies e.g. if a user selects to opt out only out of receiving cookies from a particular advertising network only the advertising system corresponding to that advertising network is prompted to run a script to create an opt out cookie . Test system may send a request to an advertising system to test that the correct script is called to create a cookie. The advertising system may then run a script to create an opt out cookie for test system in response to a prompt or instruction from opt out system or alternatively opt out system may generate the opt out cookie in response to a request from test system .

In accordance with yet additional embodiments test system may then run tests to determine that test system receives a proper opt out cookie from each advertising system based on the requests that test system sent to opt out system . After each advertising system creates the opt out cookie and sends the opt out cookie to the test system test system may analyze the cookie to determine that values of the cookie are correct. For example test system may run a test to determine that the lifespan of the opt out cookie is consistent with predetermined guidelines e.g. no shorter than 3 or 5 years . Test system may run other tests to determine that other values associated with an opt out cookie are correct such as there is no unique ID parameter to track the cookie or personal information related to the user all ID values are set to a dummy value e.g. representing an opt out value tracking value is set to a predetermined tracking value for opt out cookies e.g. 0 etc. Test system may also perform tests based on the type or form of opt out cookie e.g. an HTTP cookie or a Flash cookie . Test system may also run tests to determine whether other cookies besides opt out cookies transmitted from advertising system have proper values. For example test system may run a test to determine that the lifespan of an ad cookie is no longer than a predetermined amount of time.

Test system may run tests to determine whether the opt out cookie received from an advertising system is set correctly on test system depending on what if any cookie corresponding to the advertising system is stored on test system see e.g. the exemplary embodiment of . Test system may repeat tests to determine whether opt out system correctly identifies the type of cookie e.g. opt out on test system and that opt out system displays the correct indicator on the website of opt out system .

According to still further embodiments test system may test whether an opt out cookie set on test system functions properly. Test system may send a request to a website that is connected directly or indirectly to an advertising network corresponding to an advertising system . To perform the test test system may send a request directly to the advertising system . The advertising system may respond to the request from test system . Test system may run a test to determine whether an opt out cookie is transmitted to the advertising system with or in response to the request.

After test system determines an outcome of one or more individual tests test system may generate a report based on the outcome of each test. Test system may log the report in a database or in another form on for example an internal storage of test system or a storage device external to test system . Additionally or alternatively test system may transmit a report through email or other suitable communication means. Reports may be sent to owners or operators of an opt out system or advertising network or system. Additionally or alternatively reports may be transmitted to a third party or members of a specific action group associated with an advertising network or advertising system . The members of a specific action group may include one or more persons responsible for fixing any failures identified in a report for a particular test. Test system may also transmit such reports when problems or failures are identified by the outcome of a test i.e. the outcome of the test is negative .

In accordance with additional embodiments test system may wait until all tests within a series of different tests are completed in an interval before generating one or more reports. Test system may then organize the information from the reports into different emails for specific entities or action groups. Test system may also organize emails for individual members of the specific action groups that compile information from reports based on an individual member s membership in different action groups. Test system may determine a level of seriousness of any failures or problems identified within a series of different tests. The level of seriousness may be based on the number of problems identified and for what specific tests the problems are identified. When a levels of seriousness is above a predetermined threshold test system may send an alert email to for example a privacy group or a specific individual e.g. a high level manager who is not a member of any specific action group.

Test system may use configuration system to perform an automated healing procedure to fix any failures or problems that are detected during any tests. As noted above problems may be detected when the outcome of a test is negative. Test system may convert troubleshooting information in one or more of the generated reports into machine readable instructions. Test system may transmit the machine readable instructions to configuration system . Alternatively test system may first compile the machine readable instructions and then send the compiled machine readable instructions to configuration system .

Configuration system may communicate with each one of test system advertising system and or opt out system either directly or through network .

When the received cookie is supposed to be an opt out cookie based on the request originally sent by test system to opt out system test system may analyze whether the values in the cookie are proper for an opt out cookie.

At step test system may determine whether the received cookie is properly set on test system . After step is complete test system may repeat steps and for subsequent tests. For example for an alternative test test system may prompt advertising system to either send an opt out cookie to test system or request a normal cookie from test system . After all tests are complete test system may restart at step . At step test system may re configure the settings of test system to set new environmental conditions. After the new environmental conditions are set test system may repeat steps and .

At step configuration system may reboot at least one server or set of servers of opt out system and advertising system . In the description of steps and opt out system and advertising system may refer to only one individual physical server or set of servers that is responsible for the detected problem the individual physical server s may be described by troubleshooting information . Alternatively multiple individual physical systems may comprise opt out system and cookie system . Rebooting a server may include first shutting the server down and then powering the server back up. Instead of or in addition to step configuration system may optionally alert test system to re execute one or more tests of opt out system . Configuration system may alert test system to only re execute a subset of tests to determine whether a previously discovered problem has been corrected. If test system determines based on an outcome of a re executed test that a problem has not been corrected by rebooting at step configuration system may optionally proceed with step after repeating steps and and skipping step .

At step configuration system may optionally reconfigure at least one server or set of servers of opt out system and advertising system . Reconfiguring a server or set of servers may include pushing down the most up to date configuration the on the server s . Reconfiguring may also include rebooting the server s after the most up to date configuration file is pushed down. After step configuration system may alert test system to re execute one or more tests of opt out system . If test system determines based on an outcome of a re executed test that a problem has not been corrected by reconfiguring at step configuration system may proceed with step after repeating steps and and skipping steps and .

At step configuration system may optionally reformat at least one server or set of servers of opt out system and advertising system . After step configuration system may alert test system to re execute one or more tests of opt out system if test system determines based on an outcome of a re executed test that a problem has not been corrected by reformatting at step configuration system may proceed with step after repeating steps and and skipping steps and .

At step configuration system may determine whether there is at least one other individual physical server that correctly performs the same role as the individual physical server responsible for a detected problem. For example there may be at least one other server when opt out system is comprised of two individual physical servers where one individual physical server is responsible for the problem and the other individual physical server correctly performs the same role. If there is at least one other server configuration system may remove the individual physical server responsible for the problem from rotation. Removing the individual physical server from rotation may not allow the server to act as part of opt out system . If there is no other server that correctly performs the same purpose automated healing may not be successful when the problem is not corrected after steps and . The problem may not be corrected until someone for example from the specific action group resolves the problem in response to an alert through email with a report .

Test system may also be configured to have a cookie corresponding to advertising system before a test is conducted by test system . Test system may receive an opt out cookie corresponding to advertising system . Test system may determine that test system properly overrides the advertising system cookie with the opt out cookie by deleting the advertising system cookie and setting the opt out cookie.

Test system may also be configured to already have an opt out cookie for advertising system set on test system before a test is conducted by test system . Test system may receive another opt out cookie for advertising system . Test system may determine that test system already has an existing opt out cookie that the opt out cookie is not overridden that test system does not need the newly received opt out cookie and that the existing opt out cookie continues to be properly set.

Using the exemplary embodiments outlined above a test system e.g. test system of may monitor a compliance of an opt out system e.g. opt out system of with one or more user specified opt out preferences and further with one or more requirements imposed on web sites and advertising systems.

Job server then determines in step whether additional tabulated task requests and or additional polling information require matching fulfillment and delegation. If such additional tabulated task requests and polling information exist then exemplary method passes back to step and job manager server continues to receive task requests match task requests to available agents based on received polling information and delegate the matched task requests to the available agents. In such embodiments job manager server may continuously receive task requests from input sources may continuously receive polling information from web scanning server testing server and miscellaneous job server and may continuously delegate received tasks requests with corresponding available agents of web scanning server testing server and miscellaneous job server . If however job manager server determines in step that no additional tabulated task requests and polling information exist then exemplary method is complete in step .

In the embodiments described above job manager server may delegate a request to collect forensic data associated with an advertiser a content provider or an electronic retailer to an agent of web scanning server e.g. one or more of agents and . For example job manager server may received a request to scan a group of websites hosted by web server and may subsequently receive polling information indicating that agent of web scanning server is available for scanning purposes. In such an embodiment job manager server may dispatch configuration information for the received scan request to web scanning server for execution by the agent as described below in reference to .

For example as described above web scanning server may transmit polling information across communications network to job manager server indicating that agent is available to perform a scan. In response to the transmission of the polling data in step web scanning server may receive configuration information from job manager server specifying the requested scan and identifying an object of the scan e.g. a website a group of websites or one or more graphical user interfaces e.g. web based or mobile interface . For example the received configuration information may identify the websites and graphical user interfaces by Internet Protocol IP address by domain name by Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP address or by any additional or alternate identifier apparent to one of skill in the art and appropriate to web scanning server .

In step and upon receipt of the configuration information agent of web scanning server scans the requested object and generates corresponding forensic data. For example agent may generate an automated browser interface to access the requested website group of websites or graphical user interfaces and in step may subsequently scan the accessed website group of websites or graphical user interfaces to identify forensic data. In such embodiments agent may represent a web crawler executed by web scanning server to scan the requested website group of websites or graphical user interfaces.

In step web scanning server may collected the forensic data generated by agent during the scan of the requested website group of websites or graphical user interfaces. For example the collected forensic data may include but is not limited to cache and script files data streams generated by and or transmitted to the accessed website group of websites or graphical user interfaces locally stored objects LSOs associated with the accessed website group of websites or graphical user interfaces e.g. cookies Flash cookies HTML5 storage Silverlight storage advanced browser caching information device fingerprinting history sniffing and or other instances of nonstandard tracking not associated with a privacy policy screenshots of rendered content information indicative of system failure and information indicative of unexpected changes or unauthorized access to an integrity of a file system e.g. due to malicious content .

Further in such embodiments the forensic data may also include information that web scanning server determines would enable a third party to identify a user of the accessed websites or graphical user interfaces. Such identifying information may include but is not limited to account identifiers associated with the user e.g. Facebook and social network identifiers auction site identifiers identifiers associated with content providers and identifiers associated with electronic commerce portals email addresses photographs mailing or physical addresses e.g. street city state and zip code fine geo location information e.g. latitude and longitude IP addresses e.g. Internet and intranet addresses IPv4 addresses and IPv6 addresses mobile device identifiers Media Access Control MAC addresses associated with the user birthday information gender marital status phone number first and last name MD5 hashes and base64 encoding of identifiers an education and or employment history a shopping purchase history or information and a search history. Further in additional embodiments the collected forensic data may identify instances of data leakage where account data is passed to third parties i.e. either deliberately via explicit HTTP call or redirect or inadvertently via exposure in the HTTP referrer .

The forensic data collected in step may also identify data that web scanning server determines would be sensitive and thus protected from disclosure by a user. Such sensitive information may include but is not limited to financial identifiers and account numbers of the user the user s social security number medical conditions of the user the user s religious affiliation the user s sexual preference and any password or passwords that enable the user to log into the accessed website or group of websites.

Furthermore while scanning the requested websites or graphical user interfaces in step agent may determine whether advertising identifiers share storage or domain space with personal information or alternatively are associated with a common storage mechanism e.g. cookies or HTML5 . Furthermore agent may detect zombie cookies e.g. PII and non PII tracking cookies that respawn and or cross device tracking techniques by maintaining historical record of tracking identifiers. For example after clearing tracking state agent may detect if identifiers reappear after interacting with the same sites or parties on the same device i.e. zombie cookies or different devices i.e. cross device tracking techniques .

Further in an additional embodiment agent may emulate a mobile device and scan portions of a graphical user interface provided by an online application store in step e.g. iTunes the Apple App Store and Google Play . In such an embodiment agent may detect a presence or a function of the privacy policy in the applications store and to determine that the privacy policy is accessible prior to downloading and installing an application. Further while emulating a mobile device agent may collect identifiers and personal data e.g. a device identifier personally identifiable information PII address book information text messages photos phone calls fine geo location information for parties associated with the application and or the mobile device in step .

Referring back to web scanning server may format the collected forensic information in step and may store the formatted forensic data within a forensic repository e.g. forensic repository of in step . For example in step web scanning server may format the collected forensic data as string of raw text in tab delimited format in comma delimited format Lightweight Directory Access Protocol LDAP format or in any additional or alternate format consistent with forensic repository . In step web scanning server may transmit a confirmation of the completion of the requested scan across communications network and exemplary method is complete in step .

As described above in reference to and upon receipt of the confirmation from web scanning server job manager server may generate a report indicating the completion of the requested scan and additionally or alternatively a portion of the forensic data associated with the requested scan. In such embodiments the generated report may be transmitted to the input source and additionally or alternatively may be disseminated to multiple parties associated with an email list or published on a web page e.g. within an intranet .

In the embodiments described above job manager server may also delegate a request to perform an analytical operation on forensic data associated with a website a group of websites or a graphical user interface e.g. web based or mobile interface to an available agent of testing server e.g. agent of . For example job manager server may receive a request from an input source to perform an analytical operation on the forensic data associated with an advertiser a content provider or an electronic retailer and may receive polling information indicating that agent is available to analyze the forensic data. Job manager server may then dispatch configuration information identifying the received request for analysis to testing server for execution by agent as described below in reference to .

For example as described above testing server may transmit polling information across communications network to job manager server indicating that agent is available to conduct tests. In response to the transmission of the polling data in step testing server may receive configuration information identifying a requested analytical operation to be performed on forensic data associated with a website e.g. www.aol.com a group of websites e.g. all websites associated with the AOL domain a graphical user interface e.g. web based or mobile an individual user e.g. information associated with user1 aol.com a specific user device e.g. information associated with a corresponding MAC address combinations thereof or any additional or alternate portion of the stored forensic data accessible to and identifiable by agent .

In step and upon receipt of the information identifying the analytical operation agent accesses forensic repository and identifies the forensic data associated with the requested analytical operation. In an embodiment and as described above the forensic data may be identified and isolated within forensic repository using any portion of the confirmation information associated with the requested analytical operation e.g. information identifying a website or group of websites an individual user or a specific user device.

In step agent may perform the requested analytical operation on the identified and isolated forensic data. In an embodiment the requested analytical operation may process the forensic data associated with one or more websites and graphical user interfaces to determine a level of compliance with one or more of the following 

Further in step agent may also identify potential vulnerabilities in the privacy and security afforded by the websites and graphical user interfaces based on a general tracking hygiene within the identified forensic data. For example in step agent may process the forensic data to identify non standard tracking techniques e.g. HTML5 storage e tags Flash cookies Silverlight web cache history sniffing fingerprinting not currently disclosed by the privacy policy of the website or graphical user interface to detect instances of data leakage where account data is passed to third parties to detect the presence of personal account information or sensitive in cookies or local storage and to detect if advertising identifiers share storage space domain space or storage mechanisms with personal information or are present in the same storage method. Agent may in such embodiments also detect zombie cookies cross device mapping techniques non HTTP traffic requests e.g. UDP non port 80 TCP and or DNS cname masquerades e.g. the use of first party sub domains that have DNS records belonging to unaffiliated third parties . Further for forensic data associated with video players or video content agent may also determine whether video information e.g. title and content is inadvertently shared and or leaked to third parties.

Additionally agent may process the forensic data to identify potential vulnerabilities induced by mobile devices in step . For example agent may emulate a mobile device to identify the presence and function of a privacy policy within an application store accessible to the mobile device e.g. iTunes the Apple App Store or Google Play to determine whether short notice mechanisms and or consent checks are rendered before an use of an obtained application and to ensure that corresponding opt out mechanisms function appropriately and effectively halt data collection and or targeting.

In order to analyze the forensic data for potential privacy vulnerabilities in step agent may perform one or more types of specific analytical operations on the identified forensic data. In an embodiment the specific tests may correspond to specific types of data within the identified forensic data and include but are not limited to hyperlink tests image tests LSO tests cookie tests and page tests.

For example when the forensic data includes a hyperlink agent may perform a hyperlink test on the forensic data in step to check the hyperlink for appropriate text e.g. an appropriate Privacy Policy a working target i.e. that the hyperlink target is not broken and points directly to the appropriate destination and the hyperlink is visible and clickable e.g. not covered or buried under other elements . Further when the forensic data includes an image call e.g. an Ad Choices icon agent may perform an image test on the forensic data in step to ensure that an image associated with the image call is visible e.g. not covered or buried under other elements and that the image call returns successfully and with an appropriate image e.g. that a checksum matches a known good image or through an application of an appropriate pattern recognition algorithm .

When the forensic data includes a LSO e.g. a tracking cookie the LSO may be analyzed in step to determine the presence or specific types of prohibited data e.g. personal or sensitive information to identify whether the LSO has expired and or to determine whether the LSO has been physically written to a local storage device and returned during a subsequent call e.g. the transmission of a HTTP request . However the number of specific steps of a test applied to a particular LSO within the forensic data may vary based on the LSO type e.g. whether the LSO is a tracking cookie whether the value of the LSO is encoded in Flash whether the LSO is included within an SQLite database or whether the LSO references a digital fingerprint .

Additionally when the forensic data includes an image or rendered content associated with a particular web page agent may perform an page test on the forensic data in step to determine whether HTML or Javascript code corresponding to the image includes specified content values in the form of HTML tags or text controls e.g. an opt out button or an I agree checkbox elements or code necessary to perform a function or display an opt out feature. In such embodiments agent may leverage optical character and pattern recognition techniques to detect the presence of the specified elements and values within the image.

Referring back to upon completion of the analytical operation on identified forensic data by agent testing server may format the output of the requested test in step and then transmit the formatted output to job manager server in step . Exemplary method is then complete in step .

As described above upon completion of the requested analytical operation job manager server may generate a report indicating the completion of the requested analytical operation which may include at least a portion of the output of the analytical operation. The generated report may then be transmitted to the input source and additionally or alternatively may be disseminated to multiple parties associated with an email list or published on a web based intranet e.g. as a web page . In such embodiments the generated report may indicate a level of compliance with one or more privacy regulations set forth by U.S. authorities foreign government and self regulatory organizations as described above.

In the embodiments described above agents and of testing server may analyze and conduct tests on specific portions of forensic data within forensic repository e.g. as part of step of to ensure the compliance of a specific advertising or content provider network e.g. those provided by AOL with guidelines set forth by self regulatory organizations e.g. NIA DAA and IAB with standards organization e.g. W3C with U.S. state and federal privacy laws and with privacy laws within the European Union. In such embodiments agents and may conduct regional and organizational specific tests on portions of the forensic data portions to ensure compliance with privacy and security regulations and consent mechanisms.

For example to comply with privacy regulations in California agents and may analyze portions of the forensic data corresponding to the network to ensure that each page owned and operated by the network includes a link to a current privacy policy which itself must include working links to the DAA the NAI and or an operational behavioral advertising opt out. In such embodiments the test performed by agents and may ensure concurrency among privacy policies on the web pages associated with the network including co branded web sites and sites not controlled by the network s content management service CMS and to detect when an outdated privacy policy is presented to a user.

Furthermore each of the self regulatory organizations e.g. the DAA the NIA and the IAB require that the network provide its users with an opt out function that upon execution halts behavioral advertising targeted to the users. In order to ensure compliance among web pages and sites owned and operated by the advertising or content provider network agents and may analyze cookies HTTP calls and server responses within corresponding portions of the forensic data to ensure that the user s opt out preference is stored persistently and not overwritten and respected by future interactions with advertising servers. Agents and may further ensure that the forensic data portion accurately reports whether or not the user is currently being tracked opted in not being tracked opted out or has no tracking state all cookies empty . In such embodiments the reported opt out state reported to the input source by job manager server e.g. via a corresponding graphical user interface or web page may reflect the content of a persistent opt out cookie.

To ensure further compliance with the opt out function agents and may examine corresponding portions of the forensic data to ensure that each opt out mechanism functions identically and consistently regardless of origin opt out portal i.e. all portals should be in complete agreement with regards to the user s current opt out state . Furthermore upon execution of a successful opt out request agents and and additionally or alternatively agents and may surf the network with the opt out preference enabled and look for instances where behavioral advertising occurs or the opt out preference is inappropriately rescinded overwitten. At the conclusion of the surf session the opt out portal will be revisited to ensure that the current opt out state is still accurately reported.

The embodiments described above also enable agents and of testing server to ensure that an advertising or content provider network complies with both the technical and policy protocols of the Do Not Track specification proposed by the World Wide Web Consortium W3C . For example upon enablement of a Do Not Track DNT signal e.g. enabling an HTTP header with the value of DNT 1 agents and may analyze forensic data corresponding to the advertising or content provider network to ensure that the network properly acknowledges the user s intent not to be tracked and as such that no behavioral advertising or information sharing with third party entities occurs. Further upon enablement of a tracking exception i.e. request to track despite the DNT signal agents and may analyze forensic data corresponding to the advertising or content provider network to ensure that normal tracking resumes. Additionally upon revocation of the tracking exception agents and may analyze forensic data corresponding to the advertising or content provider network to ensure that the network respects the initial DNT signal.

In additional embodiments and may analyze forensic data corresponding to an advertising or content provider network to ensure that the advertising or content provider network complies with the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act COPPA which prohibits websites intended for children under thirteen from collecting data absent parental consent. For example agents and may test the forensic data to ensure that parental control and consent mechanisms are available and properly functioning may scan the forensic data to identify known code tags pixels or calls that enable behavioral advertising or geo location algorithms may identify pages associated with preteen login credentials that enable the collection or sharing of specific account information and or may scan portions of the forensic data associated with emulated mobile applications for sharing or use of device identifiers for secondary purposes.

Agents and of testing server may also analyze forensic data corresponding to an advertising or content provider network to ensure compliance with EU privacy regulations. In such embodiments agents and may scan portions of the forensic data associated with EU specific websites to ensure that notice consent and choice mechanisms are served and rendered appropriately.
