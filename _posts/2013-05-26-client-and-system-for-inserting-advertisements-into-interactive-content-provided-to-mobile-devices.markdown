This patent application makes reference to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 985 702 entitled QUESTIONNAIRE NETWORK FOR MOBILE HANDSETS filed on Nov. 10 2004. The complete subject matter of the above referenced United States patent application is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This patent application makes reference to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 530 175 entitled QUESTIONNAIRE NETWORK FOR MOBILE HANDSETS AND A TRADING SYSTEM FOR CONTRACTS ON USER COMMITMENTS TO ANSWER QUESTIONNAIRES filed on Dec. 17 2003. The complete subject matter of the above referenced United States Provisional patent application is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates generally to the interactions between mobile handset and it s a server within a network and more specifically to the ability to create and send interactive advertisements to a mobile handset and receive user responses.

Electronic devices such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants PDA s often contain small screens with very limited viewing area. They are constrained in terms of how much information can be displayed and in terms of user interaction capabilities. The keyboards on cell phones for example are not conducive for user data entry and only brief user inputs can be solicited from a user without annoying the user.

In a PC based access to a website often Internet advertisements and presented to a user. For example an image and accompanying text for an advertisement is displayed with a link to a web page or to some additional product information. If a user clicks the advertisement those links are exercised and the webpages are displayed. Unfortunately these webpages are annoying to some users and websites block such advertisements. Often users block them in their browsers especially those that are popup ads. However such Internet websites and popup ads are not useful or convenient or appropriate for mobile advertisements wherein a mobile user with a mobile phone is not likely to either receive or conveniently review such Internet based advertisement. Therefore creating appropriate mobile advertisements for mobile phones is not easy. Internet webpages that provide advertisements are usually not appropriate for mobile phone users for several reasons.

In addition some mobile advertisements prompt user to purchase a product and take them to a shopping cart for sales. The shopping carts and associated webpages prompt users for shipping address billing address credit card information etc. These webpages with shopping carts are neither appropriate for mobile phones nor convenient for a user who might want to purchase the advertised product. The whole process of prompting necessary information from a user using a mobile phone is inconvenient due to the inability of the user to enter a large amount of text conveniently using the small keys of a mobile phone and due to small screens on such devices. Internet advertisement based sales completion process provided by websites to a typical user are not convenient and often incompatible with small form factor devices such as mobile phones and PDAs. The user can neither conveniently read browse through the advertisements presented nor provide detailed shipping billing and other information needed to compete sales via the user s mobile phone.

Information access from typical Internet based websites using mobile devices are quite often unsatisfactory and not useful due to several factors not least of which is the multi media and graphics rich format in which most Internet websites are designed. In addition Internet websites tend to be and made available with a lot of graphics and prone towards needless verbosity of text. A mobile phone with a small screen is not a good candidate for viewing such complicated and graphics rich with graphics flash screens video components etc. content imagine a webpage being presented to a user that has a music component a whole a page of text over 3 KB of text and three large diagrams and a table of information all on the same webpage. Such a multi media webpage is very typical and is obviously unsuitable for access using a mobile device such as a small cell phone.

User interaction in real time such as those provided for a user using a PC on the Internet are often not possible for a user using a cell phone. For example the amount of textual information presented to a user cannot be a full page of textual information that is typically made available to a PC. Graphical information also cannot be large and too many graphical images should not be on the same webpage. A typical website provides a rich multi media experience that has several graphical images large amounts of text tables etc. The same website when accessed from a cell phone would not only be unreadable due to its large amount of text graphics and even video but also frustrating due to the nature of web sites the design of websites often being multi media based predominantly providing large multi media web pages full of text graphics flash based and even containing videos . Often webpages on the Internet provide detailed information to a user while soliciting inputs from a user. Thus there is a problem in presenting a mobile user with information in order to solicit user input when the user is using a cell phone. Soliciting user input from a user when the user is using a cell phone rather than a PC is a big problem.

Mobile devices such as a cell phone are therefore devices for which traditional websites are ill prepared to provide information. In addition surveys or questionnaires that are created for Internet based access via a PC are not appropriate for cell phone access. Asking one or more detailed questions with information on how to answer them is possible on a web page that is accessed from a PC. However the same web page would be unsuitable unmanageable and difficult to browse and navigate on a cell phone with a small LCD screen and small keyboard for user input.

There is often a need to present a user with a list of items and be able to determine which of those items interest the user. For example the list of items could be a list of camcorders or a list of houses for sale. There are no easy ways to do this if the user is using a mobile device. In fact if an MMS email is sent to the user with all the items each item may include graphics text etc. the user has to in the first place subscribe to the expensive MMS service. Secondly he has to be able to receive MMS service on his device. Thirdly after receiving an email with all those items the user has to browse them and send an email back from the device to show which items he is interested in. The email response would require the user to include the entire MMS message or significant portions thereof with his comments incorporated in order to provide the context for the response showing selective interest. This inclusion of received multi media text would make the email response quite large unnecessarily large . On the other hand if the user were to not include significant portions of the received mail in his response his responses may be read out of context or be associated with the wrong context. Thus information solicited from a user via a email response is cumbersome despite being expensive and email response from mobile being a painful experience and inadequate.

Surveys cannot currently be sent to mobile devices easily as responding to surveys on a mobile device is not easy due to the large amounts of text accompanying each question and the limitations of a small screen that are not appropriate to review large amounts of text. Also most surveys require some text entry something very inconvenient for most people who use mobile phones.

Further limitations and disadvantages of conventional and traditional approaches will become apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art through comparison of such systems with the present invention as set forth in the remainder of the present application with reference to the drawings.

The present invention is directed to apparatus and methods of operation that are further described in the following Brief Description of the Drawings the Detailed Description of the Invention and the claims. Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention made with reference to the accompanying drawings.

The network comprises the interactive media creator the plurality of mobile devices and a distribution server . The network also comprises a user profile database a user targeting server an advertisement pricing server an advertisement inserting server and an user response tracking server all communicatively coupled to the distribution server via the network which may be a public or private communication network a wireless network a cellular network a LAN or the Internet. Some of the plurality of mobile devices are cell phones PDAs and various hand held devices while others may be laptops small PCs computers etc. The display of interactive media in a recipient mobile device requires the use of a corresponding client component such as a Qello or QClient component from Vaudiofone that can display render interactive media components one component or item at a time. For example a multi item user interest survey is displayed one item at a time. A multi product list is displayed one product at a time. A list of real estate on sale is displayed one house or property at a time with accompanying text graphics and audio components. In general the client component in the mobile devices are capable of playing audio assisted interactive media on the mobile device or a PC where it is installed.

When the interactive media received for display by the mobile devices is a list of products the user is presented with the list of products in a list of panels one product item in general in each panel with accompanying text graphics and audio information. Supplementary information for each product in the form of textual audio and graphic content is also provided. As the user views each product from the list of products the user can read the textual information see the graphics and listen to the audio information provided. Additional details can be retrieved in the form of supplementary information provided. When a user views any product in the set of products provided during one user session the user can show interest in one or more products select them for trials etc. In addition an offer to purchase some of the products is provided which the user can exercise to purchase them. The user is provided an opportunity to purchase a product for example using a radio button that prompts user to purchase . At the end of the viewing process end of a session typically the user s responses are sent to the distribution server which processes them. If the server detects that the user has selected the purchase option for any product it initiates an approval request for a sales transaction to be conducted with one or more merchants businesses. For seeking user approval for the purchase of the product using a user billing and shipping information previously provided by an user during a registration process a user profile is accessed that is available to the server.

The user profile typically provided by a user during a registration process that is stored in the user profile database provides a shared secret such as a PIN in addition to a billing account a billing address and a shipping address. For example employing the user s mobile device specifically via the client software in the mobile device the user is prompted for a PIN number to authenticate the user as part of an approval process for a purchase initiated by the user. The PIN number or some other code previously registered by user provided by a user is securely communicated to the distribution server for example over an SSL connection. Then the distribution server verifies the PIN with the help of information retrieved from the user profile database as necessary and on successful verification conducts one or more sales transactions sends an invoice to the user via the mobile device . It also sends him an email to the user confirming the purchase which may be received and viewed by the user of his mobile device or on some other laptop PC computer. In addition the distribution server employs a billing account provided by the user during a previous registration process to conduct the sales transaction such a billing account typically comprising a credit card number an expiry date security code etc. that is stored in the user profile database .

In one embodiment of the present invention the interactive media being displayed to the user in a list of products comprises a prompt to user to make an appointment . For example if an individual product comprises a real estate instance such as a house for sale the user can make an appointment to see the house. The associated product item real estate on sale for example comprises a radio button with descriptive text comprising the phrase make an appointment that can be selected by a user to make a request for an appointment to see the house. If the user selects that radio button associated with the individual product on display in the appropriate panel from the product list to make an appointment the distribution server processes the request for an appointment and creates a calendar entry in the distribution server . A copy of the calendar entry is sent to the user using the client of the mobile device an email or an SMS facility. In a related embodiment a questionnaire is sent to the user on his mobile device to prompt the user to select one of several available appointment schedule slots the response provided by user being used to setup an appointment. In another related embodiment the user is prompted with an audio query with accompanying multiple choice text that aids the user in selection of an appointment schedule. The user s response is received and processed by the distribution server and a calendar entry or an invitation to attend a meeting is sent to the user via the client an email or an SMS notification as appropriate . In a related embodiment the client in the mobile device prompts the user to enter a security code when the user s response to the list of products or list of real estate entries comprises a response indicating interest in making an appointment for visiting one at least one of the real estate property for sale. The user enters a security code such as a PIN code that has been previously established out of band and subsequently made available to the distribution server .

To target users that are appropriate for an ad the distribution server uses one or more targeting strategies techniques provided by the user targeting server . For example in one technique the price paid by a user for his residence is determined from publicly available online sources or from databases provided by or accessible by the user targeting server then the minimum monthly payments for a 30 year mortgage could be other reasonable mortgage terms too is determined and subsequently a minimum monthly household salary for that user residence is determined The minimum monthly household salary is correlated and adjusted to the average household income in that city neighborhood as appropriate. Then the phone number of that residence is stored with an entry to the computed minimum monthly household salary for that household. The computed minimum monthly household salary is used to determine if a user is an appropriate target for a specific advertisement placed by the ad creator for example . The computed minimum monthly household salary is not used if the user has provided a salary amount or a salary range in the user profile that is typically created by the user during a registration process and stored for subsequent access in the user profile database .

When an ad creator creates an advertisement or a series of advertisements each advertisement comprises a product entry that is displayed in a product panel with accompanying text graphics and audio components and sometimes with a video clip too. The advertisements with such product entries is therefore an interactive media. The client software gets the interactive media that are rendered displayed for the user wherein the user is often able to interact and provide responses to prompts select one or more of a multiple choice set etc.

Other forms of interactive media such as questionnaires audio guided activities AGA user interest surveys etc. can also be displayed by the mobile devices employing the client software respectively. The client also supports insertion and display of advertisement during display of the interactive media. For example the client can insert an advertisement for a vacation plan during the display of a hotel experience survey to a user such an advertisement forwarded to the user s mobile device by the distribution server based on for example the targeting by a specific advertiser advertisement creator or some such entity or based on targeting logic at the distribution server. In a different scenario during the display of a questionnaire or the display of an AGA the client inserts an advertisement first if provided before the actual interactive media is rendered. In the client such as the Qello client if the recipient device displays the provided adhoc questionnaire or an AGA towards the end of such display an advertisement is played whichever advertisement happens to be inserted into the associated interactive media by the distribution server .

In one embodiment the advertisement is preloaded onto device in lazy mode and used with next user interaction viewing of content. The advertisement inserted can be based on category of questionnaire or AGA being sent to user. It may be provided by the vendor of questionnaire AGA or by a different advertiser.

An advertisement can be inserted at beginning at the end or at any intermediary position step of an interactive media. The advertisement can be in audio form video form streaming media form etc. or a combination thereof. They can be provided as an individual item among n items of an interactive media such as an individual entry among N questions of a questionnaire as a step albeit extra or dummy step in a N step AGA etc. They can be inserted by the client software in the mobile devices respectively or by the distribution server with the help of the advertisement inserting server .

The ad creator is used by a product manufacturer advertising agency etc. to create an advertisement and upload it to the distribution server for dissemination. It can also be used by them to select from a list of recipients with the help of the user targeting server . Alternatively they can provide user selection criteria for an advertisement created and upload the criteria to the distribution server along with an indication of the number of targets such as 500 users of a particular type of user profile they need to disseminate the advertisement to. The distribution server stores and processes the user selection criteria and employs it to determine a list of recipient mobile devices . For example it can communicate the user selection criteria to the user targeting server and receive a corresponding list of recipient mobile devices that it subsequently employs to disseminate the advertisement.

The ad creator also provides a user who is typically a manufacturer of a product who needs to place an advertisement an employee of an advertising agency that is conducting a campaign etc. to request a price quote for disseminating the advertisement the price or quote being provided by the advertisement pricing server . The user can then adjust the user selection criteria or the number of targeted individuals based on the price or quote received before uploading the advertisement. The user can also subsequently change the user selection criteria or the number of targeted individuals with the help of the appropriate management webpages provided by the distribution server . The advertisement pricing server determines a current price and provides a price quote to the user of the ad creator or to the distribution server as appropriate . It can determine the current price based on several criteria such as projected forecasted demand for targeted users the season holiday season vacation season etc. the number of targeted users the product category the manufacturer or marketing agency involved previous history of conducting business with them etc.

In one embodiment at least one of the user profile database the user targeting server the advertisement pricing server the advertisement inserting server and the user response tracking server are combined or integrated into the distribution server .

In one embodiment the client components are downloadable java code such as J2ME and MIDP 2.0 based client side software that can be downloaded from the distribution server and installed on the mobile devices .

The network comprises the hosted product list creator a product sales manager the storage a billing system a media delivery and activity tracking system all communicatively coupled to the server . The server comprises a user transaction authentication component used to authenticate user access and user purchases and a user profile database that comprises user billing account billing address shipping address passwords for user authentication PIN codes for user purchase authentication etc. The server also comprises a user targeting component that is used to determine target users and their mobile devices or PC locations addresses etc. and means to communicate a product list or interactive media to them. In one embodiment the PIN codes are prompted by the client software in the mobile device if the user has selected at least one of the products from the displayed product list for purchase. This prompting occurs without the server subsequently asking the user for the PIN code or for a security code in general that can be used for authenticating the user for the purchases. In addition the PIN code is encrypted by the client and communicated to the distribution server for confidentiality and non repudiation.

The billing system comprises a discount module that can compute discounts to monthly billing monthly mobile phone service charges for individual mobile phone users based on the level of participation and diligence in participation etc. in reviewing product lists communicated to them by the server . The discount module makes it possible to compute and apply discounts to monthly phone bills and monthly charges for other services subscribed to or associated with various category of mobile phone users who participate in various product list reviews interactive media based surveys and advertisements in general. The product sales manager helps in conducting a sales transaction with an external sales server system not shown when the user of the recipient computer or the recipient mobile device indicate their desire to purchase one or more products from a product list displayed on their corresponding mobile devices computers.

If the user selects Info soft key then additional information often in the form of audio information is provided. If the user selects Supl Info soft key then supplementary information in the form of textual graphic and audio information is provided as necessary. If the user selects Next soft key then the next product in a list of products is displayed if any.

An embodiment of the interactive media creator that is customized to address the specific needs of the real estate industry is employed that creates and disseminates the real estate information on sale in a region of interest to a user of a mobile device. Such an interactive media creator is called realestate content creator and it facilitates creation of the list of real estate entries that are sent to the mobile device to be viewed and optionally responded to by the user. The realestate content creator makes it possible for a real estate agent to enter an MLS listing number and provide an audio input associated with it which is then packaged as an individual real estate entry the other textual descriptions and graphic descriptions retrieved from a local or remote MLS listing service or MLS listing database. Thus one or more individual real estate entries can be assembled by the real estate agent into a customized list of real estate entries tailored to the needs of an individual mobile phone user a potential customer of the real estate agent presumably . Thus with minimal inputs from a user only an MLS number and by providing customized audio inputs to the realestate content creator a real estate list for a user is created. The realestate content creator can retrieve or fill in the accompanying textual and graphic content retrieved from a database or an multiple listing service MLS . Alternately the distribution server retrieves and fills in into an associated XML template for example descriptions of each of the residential homes and properties listed and also incorporate associated images in JPEG BMP PNG or other relevant formats . In a related embodiment the user of the realestate content creator such as the real estate agent provides only the address of the residential house and property and the audio inputs describing the sale and the rest of the information is filled in by the realestate content creator or the distribution server . The MLS is a service that real estate agents use to list properties for sale and maintain digital pictures and information about the property like asking price square footage number of rooms etc. Typically real estate agents use computer applications to search through the entries in the MLS to find a suitable property for a buyer. In the present invention the real estate agents use the realestate content creator to create a customized message to a user that includes a list of real estate entries each entry comprising details retrieved from an MLS database or service in addition to audio inputs such as a voice recording provided by the real estate agent for example each entry also comprising a multiple choice selection that allows the user on the mobile device to indicate an interest level and also request an appointment to visit the corresponding property.

The Select softkey button is used by the user to select one or more of the multiple choices provided as necessary. In general the audio assisted real estate entry form the list of real estate entries presented by the client component on the screen on the mobile device provides product service item of potential interest to user with a list of radio buttons for user to select from to show interest level. The radio buttons can be mutually exclusive or multiple selection. In one embodiment the user reviewing the current real estate entry can provide audio feedback on that particular entry to the sender using the Record softkey which is saved by the client and forwarded to the sender via the distribution server for example subsequently.

Using a Next softkey button on the screen a user can advance to the next real estate item on the current user interest survey. The screen of the client component can display user interest items from different categories of items too within the same user interest survey if necessary.

Then at a next block the server receives user response to one or more products from the list of products. Of particular interest to the distribution server are the user s request to purchase one or more of these products. Other types of user response that is of interest to some services include a user feedback of very interested make an appointment etc. these user responses often trigger additional information delivery to the mobile device or some other action such as making an appointment and sending a reference to it via email.

Then at a next block the distribution server sends either an invoice in the case of a user s attempt to purchase or an appointment notification in the case of a user s attempt to setup an appointment for a product trial or a visit to a real estate property. Both an invoice and an appointment need user approval before the corresponding actions can be taken. Then at a next decision box the distribution server determines user s response to its invoice or appointment. If it determines that the user has provided an approval then it continues to a next block where a sales transaction is conducted for user purchase and an appointment is confirmed for the scenarios where user has approved an appointment. Then at a next block the distribution server sends a confirmation to the user. Such confirmation can be via an SMS message an email a message sent to the client software in the mobile device that handles interactive media etc. Then at a next block any additional acknowledgements sent by a user are received and processed before processing terminates at a next block .

If at the decision block the distribution server determines that the user has not provided an approval then processing terminates at a next block .

A user can select one of the choices from the multiple choices sometimes more than one may be selectable and then move on to other products in the list.

At a next block the client facilitates recording of an audio response by the user. Such an audio response can comprise of a request for an additional information on individual items that interest the user feedback on items that the user has shown interest in follow up action requested by a user such as setting up an appointment at a particular time date for viewing the item or test the item or viewing a house if the item is a real estate for sale etc.

Then at a next block the client software communicates user s responses and interest information provided by user to the distribution server. Then at a next block the client software receives and optionally displays a prompt for approval sent by the distribution server such approvals necessary to conduct sales transactions and for setting up appointments as necessary based on user requests such as for visiting specific residential properties or for conducting product trials . The user is often required to provide a secret PIN code that is shared with the server out of band . In addition an Approve softkey is provided for user to approve of the sales transaction for which an invoice is often displayed or an appointment for which details are displayed too . Then at a next block the client software communicates user approval along with a PIN code or other types of security codes provided by the user as prompted to on the screen of the mobile device . The PIN code or other types of security codes are encrypted for security and confidentiality in one related embodiment the distribution server or an associated server being capable of decrypting it. In a related embodiment the communication of the PIN code and approval occurs over an SSL or TLS communication means. Finally processing terminates at the next end block .

In one embodiment the PIN code provided by the user that is sent to the distribution server also serves as an user approval of the invoice presented to the user. Thus the PIN code serves not only as an authentication of user but also as an approval of the sales transaction represented by the invoice. In a related embodiment the invoice is omitted and the user is prompted to enter the PIN code with only a total amount optionally displayed by the client in the mobile device .

The distribution server can selectively adds boilerplate text graphics music etc. as needed and forwards interactive media to specified recipient mobile devices. It selectively inserts advertisements provided by the ad creator into interactive media created by the interactive media creator employing an ad inserting component . In one embodiment it provides pricing for advertisements being placed in interactive media being disseminated such pricing being communicated to the ad creator as needed.

User interest levels received as responses to products listed and presented to a user on respective mobile devices for example are processed by the distribution server which subsequently conducts sales transactions or creates and forwards appointments based on user interests indicated.

Mobile users receive the user interest surveys on their mobile devices and respond back to it with the help of the client . For example they can show their user interest in one or more items products services real estate entries etc. presented which is captured and processed by the distribution server . Thus user interest captured from the mobile devices from users of the mobile devices is processed stored by the distribution server to a repository or reported back to the interactive media creator another server computer to the email address of an interested party or entity etc.

Users on PCs can receive interactive media on their PCs and respond to them. The PC requires a client component similar to the client in the mobile device . Users of PCs can download install a client before accessing the distribution server or have interactive media communicated to them.

As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate the terms user interest survey and survey as may be used herein comprises polls product surveys and other forms of inquiries that are typically used by enterprises to gauge the interest of their potential customers on products and services they sell provide. In particular it comprises such forms of inquiry where a user is required to or requested to provide feedback comprising their levels of interest in the various products or services brought to their attention.

As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate the terms operably coupled and communicatively coupled as may be used herein include direct coupling and indirect coupling via another component element circuit or module where for indirect coupling the intervening component element circuit or module does not modify the information of a signal but may adjust its current level voltage level and or power level. As one of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate inferred coupling i.e. where one element is coupled to another element by inference includes direct and indirect coupling between two elements in the same manner as operably coupled and communicatively coupled.
