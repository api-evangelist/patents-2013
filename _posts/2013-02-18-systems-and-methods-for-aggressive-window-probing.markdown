The present application claims priority to and is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 627 534 titled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR AGGRESSIVE WINDOW PROBING and filed on Nov. 30 2009 all of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.

The present application generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present application relates to systems and methods for managing transport layer connections using window sizes for flow control.

Many transport layer protocols use windows for flow control including the transport control protocol TCP Reliable User Datagram Protocol RUDP FastTCP and others. In protocols such as these a receiver may send a receive window value to a sender indicating an amount of data the receiver is prepared to accept. The sender may then send up to that amount of data without waiting for an acknowledgement. If the receiver is not prepared to accept any data the receiver may send a window value indicating a very small or zero size window. In many implementations of these protocols the sender receiver connection may remain open for minutes or even hours with the sender not sending any data to the receiver because of the indicated zero size window. This creates the possibility of an attack. A malicious receiver can send one or more requests for data to the sender and then indicates a small or zero size window. This can tie up memory processing cycles transport layer sockets and buffers and other resources of the sender.

The present application is directed towards systems and methods for aggressively probing a client side connection to determine and counteract a malicious window size attack or similar behavior from a malfunctioning client. The solution described herein detects when a connection may be under malicious attach via improper or unusual window size settings. Responsive to the detection the solution described herein will setup probes that determine whether or not the client is malicious and does so within an aggressive time period to avoid the tying up of processing cycles transport layer sockets and buffers and other resources of the sender.

In one aspect the present invention features a method for probing a client side connection to determine if the client is using a malicious window size related attack. The method includes a device deployed as an intermediary to a client and a server receiving an acknowledgement packet as part of a handshake protocol for a request by the client to establish a transport layer connection with the server the acknowledgement packet identifying a window size less than a predetermined value. The method also includes the device establishing a first transport layer connection with the client without linking the first transport layer connection to a second transport layer connection to the server. The method further includes the device initiating a predetermined number of window probes to the client over a predetermined time period. The method also includes the device dropping a packet sent from the client responsive to a window probe in response to the packet identifying the window size is still less than the predetermined value. The method further includes the device determining upon a final window probe of the predetermined number of window probes that the client has not increased the window size beyond the predetermined value and disestablishing the first transport layer connection responsive to this determination.

In still other embodiments the method includes the device determining that a second packet from the client sent responsive to one of the window probes has a sequence number out of order and dropping the second packet responsive to the determination.

In another embodiment the method includes the device determining that the client maintains sending updates to the window size less than the predetermined value. In still another embodiment the method includes the device determining that the client has increased the window size but the window size is still less than the predetermined value. In yet another embodiment the method includes the device not establishing the second transport layer connection with the server. In still another embodiment the method includes the device not linking the first transport layer connection to an existing second transport layer connection with the server.

In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to data parallelism can comprise distributing an amount of work based on distributing data associated with a particular hardware or software component. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to flow based data parallelism can comprise distributing data based on a context or flow such that the amount of work A N on each core may be similar substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed.

In the case of the functional parallelism approach each core may be configured to run one or more functionalities of the plurality of functionalities provided by the packet engine or VIP of the appliance. For example core may perform network I O processing for the appliance while core performs TCP connection management for the appliance. Likewise core may perform SSL offloading while core may perform layer or application layer processing and traffic management. Each of the cores may perform the same function or different functions. Each of the cores may perform more than one function. Any of the cores may run any of the functionality or portions thereof identified and or described in conjunction with . In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of performance or load .

In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of load or performance.

The functionality or tasks may be distributed in any arrangement and scheme. For example illustrates a first core Core A processing applications and processes associated with network I O functionality A. Network traffic associated with network I O in some embodiments can be associated with a particular port number. Thus outgoing and incoming packets having a port destination associated with NW I O A will be directed towards Core A which is dedicated to handling all network traffic associated with the NW I O port. Similarly Core B is dedicated to handling functionality associated with SSL processing and Core D may be dedicated handling all TCP level processing and functionality.

While illustrates functions such as network I O SSL and TCP other functions can be assigned to cores. These other functions can include any one or more of the functions or operations described herein. For example any of the functions described in conjunction with may be distributed across the cores on a functionality basis. In some cases a first VIP A may run on a first core while a second VIP B with a different configuration may run on a second core. In some embodiments each core can handle a particular functionality such that each core can handle the processing associated with that particular function. For example Core B may handle SSL offloading while Core D may handle application layer processing and traffic management.

In other embodiments work load or network traffic may be distributed among cores according to any type and form of data parallelism . In some embodiments data parallelism may be achieved in a multi core system by each core performing the same task or functionally on different pieces of distributed data. In some embodiments a single execution thread or code controls operations on all pieces of data. In other embodiments different threads or instructions control the operation but may execute the same code. In some embodiments data parallelism is achieved from the perspective of a packet engine vServers VIPs A C network interface cards NIC D E and or any other networking hardware or software included on or associated with an appliance . For example each core may run the same packet engine or VIP code or configuration but operate on different sets of distributed data. Each networking hardware or software construct can receive different varying or substantially the same amount of data and as a result may have varying different or relatively the same amount of load .

In the case of a data parallelism approach the work may be divided up and distributed based on VIPs NICs and or data flows of the VIPs or NICs. In one of these approaches the work of the multi core system may be divided or distributed among the VIPs by having each VIP work on a distributed set of data. For example each core may be configured to run one or more VIPs. Network traffic may be distributed to the core for each VIP handling that traffic. In another of these approaches the work of the appliance may be divided or distributed among the cores based on which NIC receives the network traffic. For example network traffic of a first NIC may be distributed to a first core while network traffic of a second NIC may be distributed to a second core. In some cases a core may process data from multiple NICs.

While illustrates a single vServer associated with a single core as is the case for VIP A VIP B and VIP C. In some embodiments a single vServer can be associated with one or more cores . In contrast one or more vServers can be associated with a single core . Associating a vServer with a core may include that core to process all functions associated with that particular vServer. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code and configuration. In other embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code but different configuration. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having different code and the same or different configuration.

Like vServers NICs can also be associated with particular cores . In many embodiments NICs can be connected to one or more cores such that when a NIC receives or transmits data packets a particular core handles the processing involved with receiving and transmitting the data packets. In one embodiment a single NIC can be associated with a single core as is the case with NIC D and NIC E. In other embodiments one or more NICs can be associated with a single core . In other embodiments a single NIC can be associated with one or more cores . In these embodiments load could be distributed amongst the one or more cores such that each core processes a substantially similar amount of load. A core associated with a NIC may process all functions and or data associated with that particular NIC.

While distributing work across cores based on data of VIPs or NICs may have a level of independency in some embodiments this may lead to unbalanced use of cores as illustrated by the varying loads of .

In some embodiments load work or network traffic can be distributed among cores based on any type and form of data flow. In another of these approaches the work may be divided or distributed among cores based on data flows. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approaches.

In flow based data parallelism distribution of data is related to any type of flow of data such as request response pairings transactions sessions connections or application communications. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. The distribution of data flow may be such that each core carries a substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed amount of load data or network traffic.

In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approached. In one embodiment data flow can be distributed based on a transaction or a series of transactions. This transaction in some embodiments can be between a client and a server and can be characterized by an IP address or other packet identifier. For example Core A can be dedicated to transactions between a particular client and a particular server therefore the load A on Core A may be comprised of the network traffic associated with the transactions between the particular client and server. Allocating the network traffic to Core A can be accomplished by routing all data packets originating from either the particular client or server to Core A.

While work or load can be distributed to the cores based in part on transactions in other embodiments load or work can be allocated on a per packet basis. In these embodiments the appliance can intercept data packets and allocate them to a core having the least amount of load. For example the appliance could allocate a first incoming data packet to Core A because the load A on Core is less than the load B N on the rest of the cores B N. Once the first data packet is allocated to Core A the amount of load A on Core A is increased proportional to the amount of processing resources needed to process the first data packet. When the appliance intercepts a second data packet the appliance will allocate the load to Core D because Core D has the second least amount of load. Allocating data packets to the core with the least amount of load can in some embodiments ensure that the load A N distributed to each core remains substantially equal.

In other embodiments load can be allocated on a per unit basis where a section of network traffic is allocated to a particular core . The above mentioned example illustrates load balancing on a per packet basis. In other embodiments load can be allocated based on a number of packets such that every 10 100 or 1000 packets are allocated to the core having the least amount of load. The number of packets allocated to a core can be a number determined by an application user or administrator and can be any number greater than zero. In still other embodiments load can be allocated based on a time metric such that packets are distributed to a particular core for a predetermined amount of time. In these embodiments packets can be distributed to a particular core for five milliseconds or for any period of time determined by a user program system administrator or otherwise. After the predetermined time period elapses data packets are transmitted to a different core for the predetermined period of time.

Flow based data parallelism methods for distributing work load or network traffic among the one or more cores can comprise any combination of the above mentioned embodiments. These methods can be carried out by any part of the appliance by an application or set of executable instructions executing on one of the cores such as the packet engine or by any application program or agent executing on a computing device in communication with the appliance .

The functional and data parallelism computing schemes illustrated in can be combined in any manner to generate a hybrid parallelism or distributed processing scheme that encompasses function parallelism data parallelism flow based data parallelism or any portions thereof. In some cases the multi core system may use any type and form of load balancing schemes to distribute load among the one or more cores . The load balancing scheme may be used in any combination with any of the functional and data parallelism schemes or combinations thereof.

The packet engine s A N can in some embodiments be associated with a particular server user client or network. When a packet engine becomes associated with a particular entity that packet engine can process data packets associated with that entity. For example should a packet engine be associated with a first user that packet engine will process and operate on packets generated by the first user or packets having a destination address associated with the first user. Similarly the packet engine may choose not to be associated with a particular entity such that the packet engine can process and otherwise operate on any data packets not generated by that entity or destined for that entity.

The flow distributors can comprise an interface mechanism that allows each flow distributor to communicate with the other flow distributors executing within the system . In one instance the one or more flow distributors can determine how to balance load by communicating with each other. This process can operate substantially similarly to the process described above for submitting votes to an arbiter which then determines which flow distributor should receive the load. In other embodiments a first flow distributor can identify the load on an associated core and determine whether to forward a first data packet to the associated core based on any of the following criteria the load on the associated core is above a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is below a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is less than the load on the other cores or any other metric that can be used to determine where to forward data packets based in part on the amount of load on a processor.

In some embodiments the RSS module uses the MICROSOFT receive side scaling RSS scheme. In one embodiment RSS is a Microsoft Scalable Networking initiative technology that enables receive processing to be balanced across multiple processors in the system while maintaining in order delivery of the data. The RSS may use any type and form of hashing scheme to determine a core or processor for processing a network packet.

The hash function may be designed and constructed based on any one or more criteria or design goals. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides an even distribution of hash result for different hash inputs and different hash types including TCP IPv4 TCP IPv6 IPv4 and IPv6 headers. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is evenly distributed when a small number of buckets are present for example two or four . In some embodiments hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is randomly distributed when a large number of buckets were present for example 64 buckets . In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on a level of computational or resource usage. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on ease or difficulty of implementing the hash in hardware. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on the ease or difficulty of a malicious remote host to send packets that would all hash to the same bucket.

The RSS may generate hashes from any type and form of input such as a sequence of values. This sequence of values can include any portion of the network packet such as any header field or payload of network packet or portions thereof.

In still other embodiments an instance of the flow distributor can execute on each core included in the multi core system . In this embodiment each instance of the flow distributor can communicate with other instances of the flow distributor to forward packets back and forth across the cores . There exist situations where a response to a request packet may not be processed by the same core i.e. the first core processes the request while the second core processes the response. In these situations the instances of the flow distributor can intercept the packet and forward it to the desired or correct core i.e. a flow distributor instance can forward the response to the first core. Multiple instances of the flow distributor can execute on any number of cores and any combination of cores .

The flow distributor may operate responsive to any one or more rules or policies. The rules may identify a core or packet processing engine to receive a network packet data or data flow. The rules may identify any type and form of tuple information related to a network packet such as a 4 tuple of source and destination IP address and source and destination ports. Based on a received packet matching the tuple specified by the rule the flow distributor may forward the packet to a core or packet engine. In some embodiments the packet is forwarded to a core via shared memory and or core to core messaging.

Illustrated in is an embodiment of a multi core system comprising one or more processing cores A N. In brief overview one of the cores can be designated as a control core A and can be used as a control plane for the other cores . The other cores may be secondary cores which operate in a data plane while the control core provides the control plane. The cores A N may share a global cache . While the control core provides a control plane the other cores in the multi core system form or provide a data plane. These cores perform data processing functionality on network traffic while the control provides initialization configuration and control of the multi core system.

Any portion of the memory of each of the cores may be allocated to or used for a global cache that is shared by the cores. In brief overview a predetermined percentage or predetermined amount of each of the memory of each core may be used for the global cache. For example 50 of each memory of each code may be dedicated or allocated to the shared global cache. That is in the illustrated embodiment 2 GB of each core excluding the control plane core or core may be used to form a 28 GB shared global cache. The configuration of the control plane such as via the configuration services may determine the amount of memory used for the shared global cache. In some embodiments each core may provide a different amount of memory for use by the global cache. In other embodiments any one core may not provide any memory or use the global cache. In some embodiments any of the cores may also have a local cache in memory not allocated to the global shared memory. Each of the cores may store any portion of network traffic to the global shared cache. Each of the cores may check the cache for any content to use in a request or response. Any of the cores may obtain content from the global shared cache to use in a data flow request or response.

The global cache can be any type and form of memory or storage element such as any memory or storage element described herein. In some embodiments the cores may have access to a predetermined amount of memory i.e. 32 GB or any other memory amount commensurate with the system . The global cache can be allocated from that predetermined amount of memory while the rest of the available memory can be allocated among the cores . In other embodiments each core can have a predetermined amount of memory. The global cache can comprise an amount of the memory allocated to each core . This memory amount can be measured in bytes or can be measured as a percentage of the memory allocated to each core . Thus the global cache can comprise 1 GB of memory from the memory associated with each core or can comprise 20 percent or one half of the memory associated with each core . In some embodiments only a portion of the cores provide memory to the global cache while in other embodiments the global cache can comprise memory not allocated to the cores .

Each core can use the global cache to store network traffic or cache data. In some embodiments the packet engines of the core use the global cache to cache and use data stored by the plurality of packet engines. For example the cache manager of and cache functionality of may use the global cache to share data for acceleration. For example each of the packet engines may store responses such as HTML data to the global cache. Any of the cache managers operating on a core may access the global cache to server caches responses to client requests.

In some embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store a port allocation table which can be used to determine data flow based in part on ports. In other embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store an address lookup table or any other table or list that can be used by the flow distributor to determine where to direct incoming and outgoing data packets. The cores can in some embodiments read from and write to cache while in other embodiments the cores can only read from or write to cache . The cores may use the global cache to perform core to core communications.

The global cache may be sectioned into individual memory sections where each section can be dedicated to a particular core . In one embodiment the control core A can receive a greater amount of available cache while the other cores can receiving varying amounts or access to the global cache .

Further while only a single control core is depicted the system can comprise one or more control cores each having a level of control over the system. In some embodiments one or more control cores can each control a particular aspect of the system . For example one core can control deciding which distribution scheme to use while another core can determine the size of the global cache .

The control plane of the multi core system may be the designation and configuration of a core as the dedicated management core or as a master core. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of operation and functionality the plurality of cores in the multi core system. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of allocation and use of memory of the system among the plurality of cores in the multi core system including initialization and configuration of the same. In some embodiments the control plane includes the flow distributor for controlling the assignment of data flows to cores and the distribution of network packets to cores based on data flows. In some embodiments the control plane core runs a packet engine and in other embodiments the control plane core is dedicated to management and control of the other cores of the system.

The control core A can exercise a level of control over the other cores such as determining how much memory should be allocated to each core or determining which core should be assigned to handle a particular function or hardware software entity. The control core A in some embodiments can exercise control over those cores within the control plan . Thus there can exist processors outside of the control plane which are not controlled by the control core A. Determining the boundaries of the control plane can include maintaining by the control core A or agent executing within the system a list of those cores controlled by the control core A. The control core A can control any of the following initialization of a core determining when a core is unavailable re distributing load to other cores when one core fails determining which distribution scheme to implement determining which core should receive network traffic determining how much cache should be allocated to each core determining whether to assign a particular function or element to a particular core determining whether to permit cores to communicate with one another determining the size of the global cache and any other determination of a function configuration or operation of the cores within the system .

Many transport layer protocols use windows for flow control including TCP Reliable User Datagram Protocol RUDP FastTCP and others. In protocols such as these a receiver may send a receive window value to a sender indicating an amount of data the receiver is prepared to accept. The sender may then send up to that amount of data without waiting for an acknowledgement. For example a receiver may have a receive buffer capable of holding 400 bytes. Accordingly the receiver may send a window value to a sender indicating a 400 byte receive window and the sender may then send 400 bytes of data to fill the receiver s buffer. The receiver may then send an acknowledgement with a window value indicating a 0 byte receive window. As the receiver uses or consumes the data the receive buffer will empty and the receiver may send a window value indicating it may receive further data. In many embodiments the receiver may consume data from the buffer at a rate fast enough that the buffer never completely fills and accordingly may send window values greater than zero but less than the buffer size to request more data to keep the buffer filled. For example if the receiver has a buffer of 400 bytes and receives 400 bytes but immediately consumes 200 bytes the receiver may send a window value of 200 bytes to request more data from the sender to fill the buffer.

In embodiments of the window implementation used by TCP the window is a 16 bit field in the TCP header and indicates the number of octets or bytes that the receiver may accept. Although the field is thus limited to indicating a receive window of 65 535 octets many implementations have extended this limit through the use of window scaling. For example IETF RFC 1323 TCP Extensions for High Performance allows for windows of up to 2 30 bytes equivalent to 1 gigabyte. Large windows may be useful in fast and or reliable networks such as a local LAN. Furthermore because of the large amounts of data transmitted by a sender without receiving an acknowledgement a network using large windows may be highly efficient. Conversely small window sizes may be inefficient due to packet fragmentation and delays between transmissions while waiting for the receiver to acknowledge small amounts of data.

Therefore although small window sizes are necessary in flow control particularly when a system is very busy with multiple connections and may not be able to consume data from a single buffer as fast as it is received small window sizes may cause undesirable behavior and inefficiencies. In the standard implementation of TCP discussed in IETF RFC 793 when a receiver advertizes a zero size window the sender may send a packet known as a window probe to the receiver at regular intervals. The window probe may be a single octet of new data with a new sequence number or in some implementations may be a repeat of the last sent octet of data with the previous sequence number. The receiver upon receipt of the window probe must reply with an ACK packet showing its next expected sequence number and the current window size e.g. zero . RFC 793 recommends that the sender transmit a window probe once every two minutes to reliably discover when the window is opened. Furthermore RFC 793 contemplates that the sender will continue probing the window indefinitely until the window is opened or the receiver fails to respond with an acknowledgement packet.

Accordingly small window sizes may be used as part of malicious attacks on a system. A malicious client may request data while maintaining a very small window tying up transmit buffers CPU cycles memory and network resources of the sender. In one embodiment of an attack a client may send a request to establish a transport layer connection with a server such as a TCP SYN packet. The client may transmit the request via an intermediary appliance or directly to the server. In response the intermediary or server may respond with an acknowledgement and synchronization such as a SYN ACK packet. Finally the client may respond with an ACK packet with a zero window size. The connection has been established at this point tying up a send buffer of the server or intermediary until the connection is disconnected either manually or automatically via an idle timeout.

One solution for this attack is to drop any client connection that sends a zero window size in the final ACK packet of the three way handshake that establishes the connection. However in another embodiment of an attack the client may send a very small window value in the acknowledgement such as 4 bytes and then send a request with a small or zero size window. This attack may result in even more memory used by the server or intermediary as the transmission buffer gets filled with the requested data.

Furthermore when the server or intermediary transmits the SYN ACK packet to the client the server or intermediary will include a window size indicating the amount of data that can be received from the client. In a further embodiment of an attack the client may establish a connection and then send a small amount of data to the beginning of the target server or intermediary s window and a small amount of data to the end of the target server or intermediary s window both data packets including a client receive window of zero. For example the server may send a SYN ACK packet with a window size of 1500 bytes. The client may then send a first data packet of four bytes with a sequence number e.g. 1 identifying it as the first four bytes of the window. The client then may send a second data packet of four bytes with a sequence number e.g. 1497 identifying it as the last four bytes of the window. The server may store both data packets in its receive buffer filling the entire 1500 bytes of the buffer even though only 8 bytes have been transmitted. In response to requests for the missing data the client may simply respond with ACK packets with window sizes of 0. This attack may use up server memory even faster.

In another embodiment of an attack a client may establish a connection with a normal window size and send some amount of data. When the server or intermediary responds the client may then respond with a zero size window in order to keep the connection open for as long as the server or intermediary s idle timeout will allow. Because the window size in the final acknowledgement of the three way handshake is normal this cannot be used to identify such an attack. Additionally in yet another embodiment small window sizes larger than zero but less than a predetermined value may be used in any of the above attacks.

Furthermore although described as a malicious attack in some embodiments a malfunctioning hardware or software component in a client may result in the client transmitting a small or zero size window and tying up resources of the intermediary or server. Additionally although described in terms of a client attacker and server or intermediary target the attacker or malfunctioning hardware or software may be on another intermediary or server and the target or affected system may be a client. Also although primarily discussed with regards to TCP the systems and methods described herein may be applied to other protocols that use window sizes for flow control.

Although the following discussion provides examples primarily from TCP and IPv4 one skilled in the art may readily appreciate that the following techniques and systems may be easily adapted to other transport and internet layer protocols including SCTP T TCP FastTCP TCP over IPv6 or any other protocol that supports window sizes for flow control.

Referring now to an embodiment of a system for aggressive window probing is shown. Although multiple cores A N are shown in some embodiments the system may include only a single core and a single packet engine . Additionally although only a single NIC and flow distributor are shown in some embodiments the system may include a plurality of NICs and or flow distributors . In some embodiments each of one or more packet engines may comprise or be configured with a client packet control buffer PCB A N referred to generally as client PCB s a server PCB A N referred to generally as server PCB s a timer A N referred to generally as timer s a counter A N referred to generally as counter s a surge queue A N referred to generally as surge queue s and or a probe manager A N referred to generally as probe manager s .

Still referring to and in more detail in one embodiment a packet engine may be configured with a client PCB which may be referred to as a protocol control block. The client PCB may comprise a buffer cache or memory element or portion of a buffer cache or memory element. The client PCB may comprise an type and form of data structure or object. The client PCB may store any information or data for the establishment management control or tracking of a client related or client side connection such as transport layer connection between the intermediary and the client.

In some embodiments the client PCB may be part of a network stack associated with a packet engine . The client PCB in some embodiments may be associated with or allocated to a particular client intermediary connection by the packet engine . Thus although only one client PCB is shown for clarity a packet engine may allocate a client PCB for each client intermediary connection handled by the packet engine . For example in one embodiment a packet engine may allocate or create a client PCB when a first transport layer connection to a first client is established and allocate or create a second client PCB when a second transport layer connection to a second client is established. In another embodiment the first and second transport layer connections may be established with a single client such as a first connection to a first application and a second connection to a second application. In one embodiment the client PCB may be established by the packet engine reserving a portion of memory for use in buffering transmissions to and or from the client. In a further embodiment the client PCB may be split into a send buffer and a receive buffer. In such an embodiment the send buffer may be used to buffer data waiting to be transmitted to the client. In another such embodiment the receive buffer may be used to buffer data received from the client and waiting to be consumed or processed by an application or service on the appliance such as a compression or encryption engine or waiting to be forwarded to a server.

In one embodiment a packet engine may be configured with a server PCB . Similar to the client PCB the server PCB may comprise a buffer cache or memory element or portion of a buffer cache or memory element. The server PCB may comprise an type and form of data structure or object. The server PCB may store any information or data for the establishment management control or tracking of a server related or server side connection such as a transport layer connection between the intermediary and the server. The server PCB may be created and or allocated in a similar way as the client PCB . Like a client PCB in some embodiments the server PCB may be associated with a particular server intermediary transport layer connection. In many embodiments the server PCB may comprise the same functionality and structures as the above discussed client PCB and may be used to buffer transmissions to and or from the server.

In many embodiments a packet engine may comprise a timer . Timer may comprise a service daemon process function subroutine application or any type and form of executable instructions for setting and operating a timer and sending a notification on expiration of the timer. In some embodiments timer may count upwards or downwards from a first predetermined value to a second predetermined value and may count seconds milliseconds microseconds or any interval selected by an administrator. In many embodiments a packet engine may use timer to determine an interval t at which to send window probes. For example IETF RFC 793 suggests that window probes be sent at an interval of one every two minutes. In some embodiments timer may be used to send window probes at much faster rates such as one every minute one every 30 seconds one every 10 seconds one every 5 seconds one every second or one every fraction of a second.

In some embodiments a packet engine may further comprise a counter . A counter may comprise a register a variable a registry entry a string a binary value or any type and form of value that may be incremented and decremented by the packet engine . The counter may comprise any combination of hardware and or software. In many embodiments a packet engine may increment a counter responsive to receiving an ACK to a window probe with a window size less than a predetermined value. In one such embodiment the packet engine may reset the counter responsive to receiving an ACK to a window probe with a window size equal to or greater than the predetermined value. Although shown as a single counter for clarity in many embodiments a packet engine may comprise or maintain multiple counters . For example in one embodiment the packet engine may maintain a counter for each client intermediary connection and or each client PCB . In another embodiment the packet engine may maintain a counter to identify the number of buffered requests contained in a surge queue discussed below to determine whether to drop connections.

In some embodiments a packet engine may comprise a surge queue . A surge queue may comprise a buffer cache or memory element or any other type and form of memory structure or portion thereof. In some embodiments a packet engine may use a surge queue to buffer requests to establish transport layer connections with a server that has no more available connections. For example in one such embodiment a server may have the capability to establish 500 simultaneous transport layer connections. Once the 500 connections have been established when an intermediary receives a request from a client to establish a transport layer connection with the server the intermediary may buffer the request in a surge queue. In some embodiments buffering the request in a surge queue may comprise establishing a client intermediary transport layer connection. In a further embodiment buffering the request in a surge queue may comprise keeping the connection open by transmitting one or more periodic keep alive messages. In one such embodiment the keep alive messages may be window probes. For example in one embodiment of a malicious attack a client or clients may send a plurality of requests in a surge tying up all of the free connections on a server and filling the surge queue on the intermediary. In a further embodiment these client or clients may send ACK packets to the intermediary with window sizes that are below a predetermined number as discussed above.

In another embodiment the packet engine may maintain a counter of buffered requests in the surge queue. In a further embodiment the packet engine may compare the value of this counter to a predetermined threshold. For example in one embodiment the predetermined threshold may be an independent value such as 500 requests while in another embodiment the predetermined threshold may be a value dependent on another number such as twice the number of connections that the server can accept simultaneously . In yet another embodiment the predetermined threshold may be set by a policy engine of the appliance and may be changed responsive to network congestion or traffic or may be changed manually by a user or administrator. In one embodiment responsive to the counter of buffered requests exceeding the predetermined threshold the packet engine may transmit one or more window probes to each client that has indicated a window size below a predetermined number.

In some embodiments the packet engine may further comprise a probe manager . Probe manager may comprise a service daemon process function subroutine application or any type and form of executable instructions for creating managing and or executing one or more window probes to transmit to one or more clients. In another embodiment probe manager may comprise functionality for maintaining a counter of the number of probes transmitted to a client as discussed above in relation to counter . In yet another embodiment probe manager may comprise functionality for maintaining a record of clients that have indicated a window size below a predetermined number.

Shown in is a packet flow diagram of an embodiment of an aggressive window probing method and system. Briefly at client and the appliance establish a transport layer connection. Client s last packet of the three way handshake is an ACK packet with a window size below a predetermined value. At the appliance transmits a window probe to client and at client replies with an ACK packet with a window size equal to or above the predetermined value. At the appliance establishes a transport layer connection to the server and links the client appliance connection to the appliance server connection. Similarly at step client and the appliance establish a transport layer connection. Client s last packet of the three way handshake is an ACK packet with a window size below the predetermined value. At the appliance transmits a window probe to client which responds with an ACK packet with a window size below the predetermined value. The appliance transmits a second and third window probe to client at intervals of time t receiving an ACK packet from client with a window size below the predetermined value each time. After a predetermined number of window probes without receiving an ACK packet from client with a window size equal to or above the predetermined value at the appliance terminates the connection.

Still referring to and in more detail at in one embodiment client and the appliance may establish a transport layer connection. In many embodiments establishing a transport layer connection involves a three way handshake as illustrated. For example in one embodiment using TCP client may transmit a SYN packet requesting to establish a transport layer connection. The appliance may respond with a combined SYN ACK packet as shown or may respond with separate ACK and SYN packets. Client may then respond with an ACK packet acknowledging the appliance s SYN packet or SYN ACK packet and indicate a receive window size in the ACK packet. In one embodiment the SYN packet transmitted from client is directed to the server but intercepted by the appliance acting as an intermediary. Thus in many such embodiments the client transmits a request to establish a transport layer connection with the server rather than with the appliance.

In some embodiments the ACK packet transmitted by client identifies in a window field a receive window smaller than a predetermined value. In one embodiment the predetermined value is a default maximum segment size MSS such as the 536 bytes specified in IETF RFC 793. In some embodiments the default MSS may be set to the Maximum Transmission Unit size for the Ethernet layer or some value based on or derived from the MTU such as subtracting some overhead from the MTU size. In another embodiment the predetermined value is a maximum segment size identified during the client appliance handshake process. In yet another embodiment the predetermined value is a minimum segment size. In still another embodiment the predetermined value is selected by a user or administrator. In yet another embodiment the predetermined value is selected by a policy engine. In many embodiments the predetermined value may be determined responsive to a desired efficiency level. For example because a TCP packet may have a 40 byte header including internet layer and transport layer headers if the window size was set to one byte this would result in data comprising only 2.5 of the packet. Accordingly it may be desirable to choose a minimum window size such as 10 bytes for 20 data 20 bytes for 33 data 40 bytes for 50 data 120 bytes for 75 data 400 bytes for 90 data or any other value. For example on a very reliable high speed network it may be desirable to choose a minimum window size of 100 MB or higher. In some embodiments discussed in more detail below the appliance may intentionally drop packets and or connections with window sizes that remain below this predetermined level.

Responsive to receiving the ACK packet from client with a window size smaller than the predetermined level in some embodiments at the appliance may not forward the request to establish a transport layer connection to the server. In other embodiments in which the appliance may use an established transport layer connection with the server such as when using TCP multiplexing the appliance may not connect link or associate the established client appliance transport layer connection with a server appliance transport layer connection or server PCB. In some embodiments the appliance may transmit a window probe to client via the client appliance transport layer connection. In one such embodiment the window probe is a small amount of data such as one byte. In other embodiments the window probe may be a larger amount of data. In some embodiments the window probe may include at least one byte of data past the end of the receive window identified by the client in the ACK packet. For example in one such embodiment the client may indicate a 10 byte receive window. Accordingly the appliance may transmit 11 bytes or more of data to the client. In another such embodiment the client may indicate a zero byte receive window and the appliance may accordingly transmit one or more bytes of data to the client. Although shown in with a delay of time between receiving the ACK packet at and transmitting the window probe at in some embodiments the appliance may transmit the window probe immediately. In other embodiments the appliance may transmit the window probe after a delay of any length from as short as the packet engine can process a packet to as long as seconds minutes or tens of minutes.

At in some embodiments the client may send an ACK packet acknowledging receipt of the data included in the window probe and identifying a window size. In other embodiments the client may send an ACK packet acknowledging receipt of the window probe but indicating the client has dropped the data due to exceeding its receive window and identifying a window size. In one such embodiment discussed in more detail below in reference to the client appliance communications shown in the client may send an ACK packet with a window size below the predetermined value. In other embodiments the client may send an ACK packet with a window size equal to or greater than the predetermined value as shown at indicating that the client s window size has expanded beyond the predetermined value. In another embodiment not illustrated for clarity the client may send an ACK packet and or a data packet with a window size greater than the predetermined value. In yet another embodiment not illustrated the client may fail to respond to the window probe. In one such embodiment the appliance may retransmit the window probe one or more times at a predetermined interval until an idle timeout occurs or may simply disestablish the client appliance transport layer connection.

At and responsive to receiving at an ACK packet or data packet with a window size equal to or greater than the predetermined value in one embodiment the appliance may establish a transport layer connection with the server and link or associate the client appliance transport layer connection with the server appliance transport layer connection. In another embodiment the appliance may utilize an already established server appliance transport layer connection for this purpose such as if the appliance is using TCP multiplexing. In some embodiments where the client has transmitted data to directed to the server via the client appliance transport layer connection the appliance may forward the data to the server via the appliance server transport layer connection. In some embodiments communications between client the appliance and the server may proceed as normal.

The above described packet flow from may describe situations in which a client is not engaged in a malicious attack on the server. Accordingly the appliance window probe allows for an interval in which the client may expand its receive window without consuming any resources of the server. also shows an example of an embodiment of a situation in which a client is engaged in a malicious attack. At client may request and establish a client appliance transport layer connection similar to that described with regards to client at . In many embodiments client may request or attempt to establish a transport layer connection with the server and the appliance may intercept the communication. As shown in one such embodiment the final ACK of the handshake may indicate that the client has a receive window smaller than a predetermined value.

Similar to as described above at in some embodiments the client may transmit a window probe to the client and the client may respond with an ACK packet that still indicates a window smaller than the predetermined value. In some embodiments the client may indicate that the window size is the same size as the previously indicated window size while in other embodiments the client may expand the window size while still remaining smaller than the predetermined value. For example in one such embodiment where the predetermined value is 10 bytes the client may expand a window size from 0 bytes to 1 byte or from 2 bytes to 8 bytes or any other value. In some embodiments the client may reduce the window size to a value less than the predetermined value. Responsive to receiving the ACK packet the appliance may drop the packet without forwarding the packet to the server establishing an appliance server transport layer connection or associating or linking the client appliance connection or client PCB with a server appliance connection or server PCB. In one embodiment the client may transmit data directed to the server in the ACK packet or in a separate packet while still indicating a receive window below the predetermined value. In a further embodiment the appliance may drop the data.

As shown in some embodiments the appliance may transmit a predetermined number of window probes at predetermined interval t. In one embodiment the predetermined number and interval may be selected by a user or administrator while in another embodiment the predetermined number and interval may be set by a policy engine. In a further embodiment the policy engine may select the predetermined number and interval responsive to network traffic or congestion. For example as network congestion increases the policy engine may reduce the predetermined number and or interval so that the appliance is more aggressive in probing small windows and dropping inefficient connections. In other embodiments the policy engine may increase the predetermined number and or interval. For example in a network experiencing high loss rates such as a noisy wireless network it may be desirable to increase the number of window probes in case any were lost. In one embodiment the appliance may transmit 1 2 3 4 or more total window probes at intervals of 1 second or more. In another embodiment the appliance may vary the interval t between probes. For example in one such embodiment the appliance may grow more aggressive over time with a first probe being sent after 8 seconds a second probe after 4 seconds and a third probe after 1 second.

At in some embodiments if the appliance has not received an ACK or data packet from the client with a window size equal to or greater than the predetermined value the appliance may disestablish the connection. In some embodiments as shown disestablishing the connection may include transmitting a FIN packet to the client. In other embodiments the appliance may simply drop the established connection. In a further such embodiment dropping the established connection without notifying the client may tie up resources on the client until an idle timeout is exceeded which may be desirable to slow or deter further attack attempts.

Shown in is a flow chart of an embodiment of a method of aggressive window probing. In brief at step an appliance may receive an ACK packet from a client with a window size less than a predetermined interval. At step the appliance may establish a transport layer connection with the client without linking to or establishing a transport layer connection with a server. At step the appliance may transmit a window probe to the client. At step the appliance may receive a message such as an ACK or data packet from the client. At step the appliance may determine if the message from the client has a sequence ID that is out of order. If not at step the appliance may determine if the message from the client has a window size less than the predetermined value. If not then at step the appliance may link the transport layer connection with the client to a transport layer connection with the server. However if at step the appliance determines the message has a sequence ID out of order or if at step the appliance determines that the window size of the message is less than a predetermined value at step the appliance may drop the message and increment a counter i. At step the appliance may determine if the counter i is above a predetermined number representing the number of window probes to transmit. If not then the appliance may repeat steps responsive to the expiration of a timer t. However if the counter is above the predetermined number then at step the appliance may disestablish the transport layer connection with the client.

Still referring to and in more detail at step the appliance may receive an acknowledgment packet from a client with a window size smaller than a predetermined value. As shown in some embodiments the acknowledgement packet may be the final step of a handshake establishing a transport layer connection while in other embodiments the acknowledgement packet may be received later. For example in one such embodiment a client may send a handshaking acknowledgement with a window size above the predetermined value and responsive to any request or data from the appliance the client may send an ACK packet with a window size below the predetermined value. One skilled in the art may appreciate that in such an embodiment steps and may therefore be reversed.

As discussed above in relation to in one embodiment the predetermined value is a default maximum segment size MSS . In another embodiment the predetermined value is a maximum segment size identified during the client appliance handshake process. In yet another embodiment the predetermined value is a minimum segment size. In still another embodiment the predetermined value is selected by a user or administrator. In yet another embodiment the predetermined value is selected by a policy engine. In many embodiments the predetermined value may be determined responsive to a desired efficiency level.

At step in some embodiments the appliance may establish a transport layer connection with the client without linking to a transport layer connection with the server. In some embodiments establishing a transport layer connection may comprise allocating creating or associating a client PCB with the client appliance connection. In many embodiments the appliance may not have yet established a transport layer connection with the server and accordingly may not do so at step . In other embodiments the appliance may have an established free connection with the server but at step may not link or associate the client PCB with a server PCB or transmit or forward communications from the client to the server.

At step in some embodiments the appliance may transmit a window probe to the client. In one embodiment the appliance may transmit a window probe using any of the techniques functionality and modules described above. In one embodiment the window probe may be a data packet comprising one or more bytes of payload data. In some embodiments the appliance may generate a payload of random data or null data such as all ones or all zeros. In other embodiments the appliance may generate a payload using actual data. For example in one such embodiment the appliance may generate a short query to the client. In many of these embodiments the payload contents may be irrelevant but may be included to ensure transmission because some intermediary routers between the appliance and client may be configured to drop empty packets.

In some embodiments the window probe may include a byte past the client receive window. In one embodiment the client may have sent an ACK at step with a sequence number in the acknowledgement number field of the TCP header of the next sequence number expected by the client as is described in IETF RFC 793. For example during the handshaking procedure the appliance may have indicated an initial sequence number of 1000. Accordingly when the client sends an ACK acknowledging the appliance s SYN ACK packet the client may indicate an acknowledgement number of 1000 and a window size of 5 bytes. Thus the appliance may generate a window probe of at least 6 bytes with a starting sequence number of 1000 such that at least one byte is beyond the receive window. In another example embodiment the client may have acknowledged sequence number 1000 and indicated a window size of 0 bytes. Thus the appliance may generate a window probe of at least 1 byte

At step the appliance may receive a message from the client. In one embodiment the appliance may receive an ACK packet from the client acknowledging receipt of the data in the window probe and indicating a client receive window. In another embodiment the appliance may receive an ACK packet indicating that the client dropped the data in the window probe requesting retransmission of the data and indicating a client receive window. In yet another embodiment the appliance may receive a packet acknowledging receipt of the data in the window probe and including data such as a GET request or other data and further indicating a client receive window. Furthermore although not shown in one embodiment the appliance may not receive a message from the client. In such an embodiment the appliance may drop the connection in response to an idle timeout or the expiration of an idle timer.

At step the appliance may determine if the message from the client has a sequence ID out of order. In some embodiments and responsive to the message having an out of order sequence ID the appliance will drop the packet at step . This may be done to avoid confusion where prior packets have been dropped due to window sizes below the predetermined value. For example in one such embodiment the client may send a first packet with sequence number 100 a window size of zero bytes and 100 bytes of data. Because of the window size of zero bytes the appliance may in some embodiments drop the packet. The client may then send a second packet with sequence number 200 a window size of zero bytes and 50 bytes of data. Again because of the window size the appliance may drop the packet. The client may then send a third packet with a sequence number of 250 a window size greater than the predetermined value such as 500 bytes and 200 bytes of data. Because the appliance dropped the previous 150 bytes of data from the client it may create confusion if the appliance forwards the 200 bytes with sequence number 250 to the server. Accordingly the appliance may in some embodiments drop the third packet and send an ACK message requesting sequence number 100 again.

At step the appliance may determine if the window size indicated in the message from the client is below the predetermined value. As discussed above the predetermined value may be a default value may be selected by a user or administrator or may be set by a policy engine. In some embodiments where the client is using window scaling such as the window scale option described in IETF RFC 1323 the appliance may interpret the window size in the message using both a window size field and an indicated scaling shift value.

At step if the appliance determines that the window size indicated in the message is equal to or above the predetermined value in some embodiments the appliance may link the client appliance transport layer connection with a server appliance transport layer connection. In some embodiments at step the appliance may establish a transport layer connection with the server while in other embodiments the appliance may use an already established transport layer connection with the server. In one embodiment linking the two transport layer connections may comprise linking or associating a client PCB with a server PCB or a client side socket with a server side socket. In one embodiment if the message from the client included a payload of data the appliance may forward the data to the server via the server appliance transport layer connection.

At step if the appliance determined that the message had an out of order sequence ID or that the window size indicated in the message is below the predetermined value the appliance may in some embodiments drop the message. In an embodiment where the message included a payload of data the appliance may drop the payload. In another embodiment the appliance may buffer the payload data in the client PCB but not forward the data to the server or otherwise process the payload data. In one embodiment the appliance may increment a counter i to indicate that a message has been dropped. In a further embodiment the appliance may maintain and increment a counter for each client appliance transport layer connection from one or more clients.

At step the appliance may determine if counter i is greater than a predetermined number or threshold. In some embodiments as discussed above this predetermined number may be a default number may be set by a user or administrator or may be set by a policy engine. The counter may be used to determine the number of window probes to be sent to a client such that having sent a predetermined number of probes the appliance may drop the connection. In some embodiments the counter may be reset to zero when the appliance establishes a client appliance transport layer connection at step . In another embodiment the counter may be set to a predetermined number when a client appliance connection is established at step and be decremented at step . In such an embodiment at step the appliance may determine if the counter value is equal to zero.

If the incremented counter value is greater than the predetermined number or in the embodiment discussed above if the decremented counter value is equal to zero or less than zero in case of errors then at step the appliance may disestablish the transport layer connection with the client. In some embodiments disestablishing the transport layer connection may comprise transmitting a FIN packet indicating the connection is being closed. In other embodiments disestablishing the transport layer connection may comprise resetting the client PCB NIC and or packet engine to a listening state without notifying the client. For example this may be done to force a malicious client to wait until an idle timeout occurs to drop its connection tying up client resources and memory to slow down or prevent further attacks.

If the incremented counter value is equal to or less than the predetermined number or in the embodiment discussed above if the decremented counter value is greater than zero then in some embodiments the appliance may repeat steps until the counter has reached the threshold. In one embodiment the appliance may wait to initiate repeating steps until the expiration of a timer discussed above. In one such embodiment the timer may be set to a default value selected by a user or administrator or set by a policy engine. Upon expiration of the timer the appliance may transmit another window probe to the client at step .

Shown in is a packet flow diagram of one embodiment of an aggressive window probing method and system for when a surge of client requests reaches a predetermined threshold. Although only two clients are shown for clarity in some embodiments three four dozens or hundreds of clients may be connected to or establish connections with the appliance. Server may be limited in the number of connections it can accept. For example in one embodiment server may be able to accept and process 500 simultaneous connections. When the appliance receives a new request for a connection to the server from a client and the server cannot accept any more connections the appliance may establish a transport layer connection with the client and place the connection in a surge queue. In some embodiments the surge queue may be an index of one or more client appliance transport layer connections that have not been linked to a server PCB due to the lack of available appliance server transport layer connections. The queue may be referred to as a surge queue because in many embodiments requests from one or more clients to establish transport layer connections with the server may arrive in a surge. In one such embodiment where the requests are generated maliciously this may be a form of a denial of service attack or a distributed denial of service attack. However the requests may be generated without malicious intent such as a large number of users requesting connections to a live streamed event.

In some embodiments the appliance may maintain a counter of the number of client requests that have been placed in the surge queue or buffered without being linked to a server PCB or server transport layer connection. In response to the counter value exceeding a predetermined threshold the appliance may begin disestablishing connections with one or more clients. In one embodiment the appliance may select a connection in the surge queue with a window size below a predetermined value and transmit a window probe to the client. If the client responds with an ACK indicating a window size that is still below the predetermined value the appliance may disestablish the connection. This allows for aggressive management of the surge queue.

Referring to in brief overview at an appliance may establish a first transport layer connection with a client such as client . Client s last packet of the three way handshake may be an ACK packet with a window size equal to or above a predetermined value. If the server cannot accept any further connections the appliance may place the connection in the surge queue and buffer any requests from Client . At the appliance may establish a second transport layer connection with a client such as client . Again Client s last packet of the three way handshake is an ACK packet with a window size below a predetermined value and again the appliance may place the connection in the surge queue and buffer any requests from Client . Upon determining that the additional connection from Client has increased the number of connections in the surge queue beyond a predetermined threshold at the appliance may transmit a window probe to a client such as Client . At Client may reply with an ACK packet indicating a window size that is still below the predetermined value and in response the appliance may disestablish the connection to Client . Although not illustrated for clarity in some embodiments the appliance may transmit one or more additional window probes to Client as described above in relation to before disestablishing the connection. However in other embodiments the appliance may more aggressively disestablish connections with a single window probe. In another embodiment not illustrated at Client s handshaking ACK may indicate a window size below the predetermined value. In such an embodiment the appliance may select Client as the target of the window probe at instead of Client . The appliance may select a client as the target of the window probe randomly responsive to an order of connection responsive to the amount of buffer space used by the client responsive to the time since the last message from said client or responsive to any other characteristic distinguishing one connection from another.

Still referring to and in more detail at the appliance may establish a transport layer connection with a first client such as client . In many embodiments establishing a transport layer connection involves a three way handshake as illustrated. For example in one embodiment using TCP client may transmit a SYN packet requesting to establish a transport layer connection. The appliance may respond with a combined SYN ACK packet as shown or may respond with separate ACK and SYN packets. Client may then respond with an ACK packet acknowledging the appliance s SYN packet or SYN ACK packet and indicate a receive window size in the ACK packet. In one embodiment the SYN packet transmitted from client is directed to the server but intercepted by the appliance acting as an intermediary. Thus in many such embodiments the client transmits a request to establish a transport layer connection with the server rather than with the appliance.

In one embodiment the client may indicate a window size equal to or above a predetermined value. However if the server has no available connections the appliance may not be able to link the client connection or client PCB with the server connection or server PCB. Accordingly the appliance may place the connection in a surge queue. In some embodiments in response to a server connection becoming available the appliance may remove a client transport connection from the surge queue and connect or link the connection the available server connection. In many embodiments the surge queue may be managed in a first in first out FIFO manner while in other embodiments other methods are available including last in first out round robin random or other methods in which connections are linked responsive to identifying characteristics of the connection including payload type application layer information priority QoS or any other identifiable characteristic. In many embodiments the appliance may periodically transmit a keep alive probe to one or more clients with requests in the surge queue to prevent the clients from disestablishing the connection in response to an idle timeout.

At the appliance may establish a transport layer connection with a second client such as Client in a similar method to those described above. In one embodiment Client may indicate in the ACK packet that it has a window size below a predetermined threshold. Again if the server has no available connections the appliance may not be able to link the client connection or client PCB with the server connection or server PCB. Accordingly the appliance may place the connection in the surge queue. In a further embodiment the appliance may place an identifier or flag in the surge queue to indicate that the client has advertized a window size below the predetermined threshold.

At in some embodiments the appliance may determine that the number of connections in the surge queue exceeds a predetermined threshold and may transmit a window probe to a client that has advertized a window size below the predetermined threshold such as Client . In some embodiments the appliance may generate and transmit a window probe using any of the functions or methods described above in connection with . In another embodiment the window probe may comprise a keep alive packet. In a further embodiment the appliance may send a keep alive packet as a window probe more often than the default keep alive threshold described in IETF RFC 1122. For example RFC 1122 specifies that the default interval for keep alives is no less than two hours. However in such embodiments the appliance may send a keep alive packet to probe a client s window at intervals on the order of seconds. In one embodiment the appliance may select which client to transmit the window probe to responsive to any criteria for managing the surge queue including the order in which the client requests were placed in the surge queue the amount of requests from the particular client the advertized window size of the client being smaller than a predetermined value but larger or smaller than another client s advertized window size or any other value or characteristic that distinguishes one client from another.

At the appliance may receive a response to the window probe from the client. In some embodiments the response may be an acknowledgement packet while in other embodiments the response may be a data packet a request or any other type of message that includes a receive window size value. In some embodiments if the window size value is less than the predetermined value then the appliance may drop or disestablish the connection as described above and remove the client request from the surge queue. In another embodiment not illustrated the appliance may initiate one or more additional window probes to the client to verify that the window size has not increased above the predetermined value before dropping the connection. In still another embodiment not illustrated the appliance may transmit window probes to one or more additional clients with window sizes below the predetermined value and disestablish connections to clients that have not increased their window sizes until such time as the number of requests remaining in the surge queue is below the predetermined threshold.

Shown in is a flow chart of an embodiment of a method for aggressive window probing for when a surge queue exceeds a predetermined threshold. In brief overview at step the appliance may receive a client request to establish a transport layer connection with a server the request indicating a client receive window smaller than a predetermined value. At step the appliance may determine if the server can accept more connections. If so then the appliance may transmit a window probe to the client as described in step of above. If not then the appliance may place the request in the surge queue at step . Although not illustrated the appliance may periodically transmit a keep alive packet to the client. Additionally although not illustrated the appliance may periodically repeat steps and as connections to the server become available as discussed above in connection with . At step the appliance may determine if the number of requests in the surge queue have exceed a predetermined threshold. If not the appliance may repeat steps . If so then at step the appliance may select a client with a request in the surge queue with a window size below the predetermined value and transmit a window probe to the client. At step the appliance may receive an ACK message from the client. At step the appliance may determine if the window size of the ACK message is below the predetermined value. If not then the appliance may repeat steps for another client with a request in the surge queue with a window size below the predetermined value. If so the appliance may at step disestablish the transport layer connection with the client. In one embodiment not illustrated if the client fails to respond with an ACK message at step the appliance may initiate an idle timeout timer or may immediately disestablish or drop the transport layer connection with the client.

Furthermore in an embodiment not illustrated the appliance may maintain a surge queue for each of a plurality of servers or may maintain a surge queue for each of a plurality of services or applications on one or more servers. Accordingly in such an embodiment the method illustrated at may be applied to each of a plurality of surge queues.

Still referring to and in more detail at step the appliance may receive a request from a client to establish a transport layer connection with a server. In some embodiments the appliance may intercept the request while in others the request may be directed to the appliance and the appliance may select a server for forwarding the request. For example this may be done for server load balancing purposes. In one embodiment the appliance may establish a transport layer connection with the client. In a further embodiment the appliance may performing a handshaking protocol with the client such as the three way handshake in TCP. In some embodiments the request from the client or last ACK of the handshake may indicate a client receive window size that is less than a predetermined value. In many embodiments the predetermined value may be a default value or may be selected by a user or administrator or a policy engine as discussed above. In one embodiment not illustrated for clarity the client may send a request with a window size equal to or larger than the predetermined value. When the appliance responds to the request such as with an ACK packet the client may then send a packet indicating a window size below the predetermined value. In such an embodiment the method may proceed as described with the packet being considered to be the client request with a window size below the predetermined value.

At step the appliance may determine if the server can accept more connections. In some embodiments the appliance may maintain a record of the number of connections a server can handle and decrement or increment this value as connections with the server are established and disestablished. In another embodiment in which the appliance and server multiplex a plurality of client requests in a single connection determining if the server can accept more connections may comprise determining if the single connection has sufficient remaining payload capacity or bandwidth to contain another client request or communication. If so then in some embodiments the method may proceed to step of .

At step and responsive to determining that the server cannot accept more connections the appliance may place the request in a surge queue. In some embodiments the appliance may identify or flag the request in the surge queue as indicating a client receive window below the predetermined value. Although not illustrated in some embodiments the appliance may send a keep alive message to the client at predetermined intervals to keep the connection from being dropped. In another embodiment not illustrated if the server becomes able to accept another connection the appliance may remove a client request from the surge queue and link the client transport layer connection to the server transport layer connection if the client has indicated a window size equal to or larger than the predetermined value. In some embodiments if the client has indicated a window size smaller than the predetermined value the appliance may remove the client request from the surge queue and proceed to step of .

At step the appliance may determine if the number of requests in the surge queue has exceeded a predetermined threshold. In some embodiments the threshold may be set to a default number of requests while in another embodiment the threshold may be set by a user or administrator. In yet another embodiment the threshold may set by a policy engine. In some embodiments the threshold may be set such that the surge queue may hold a number of requests equal to the number of connections that the server may accept. In other embodiments the threshold may be set such that the surge queue may hold two three or many more times the number of connections that the server may accept. In some embodiments if the appliance determines that the number of requests has not exceeded the threshold the appliance may repeat steps as more requests arrive or as more connections to the server become available.

If the appliance determines that the surge queue threshold has been exceeded at step the appliance may transmit a window probe to a client with a window size below the predetermined value. In some embodiments the window probe may comprise a keep alive message. In other embodiments the window probe may comprise a data packet with at least one byte past the client receive window as discussed above. In some embodiments the appliance may select a client to transmit the window probe based on the identifier or flag in the surge queue. In another embodiment the appliance may select a client to transmit the window probe based on an order of being placed into the surge queue. For example in one such embodiment using a last in first out condition the appliance may transmit the window probe to the client with a window below the predetermined value that was most recently added to the queue. In another such embodiment using a first in first out condition the appliance may transmit the window probe to the client with a window below the predetermined value that has been in the surge queue the longest. In yet another embodiment the appliance may select a client based on the content of the client request such as whether it is a GET request or other application layer request or data or based on the size of the client request or based on any other characteristic of the request.

At step in some embodiments the appliance may receive a message from the client indicating a window size. In one such embodiment the message may be an ACK message acknowledging the window probe. In another such embodiment the message may be a data packet or a request for data. In one embodiment not illustrated the appliance may not receive a message from the client. In such an embodiment the appliance may skip to step and disestablish the transport layer connection with the client either immediately or responsive to the expiration of an idle timeout timer.

At step the appliance may determine if the window size indicated in the client message is still below the predetermined value. If so then at step the appliance may disestablish the transport layer connection with the client. In one embodiment the appliance may send a FIN packet to the client while in another embodiment the appliance may merely drop the connection so that the client s resources are still utilized as discussed above. In a further embodiment the appliance may remove the transport layer connection from the surge queue. In yet a further embodiment the appliance may then return to step and determine if the surge queue is still exceeding the threshold. If so then the appliance may repeat steps for a second client while if the surge queue is no longer exceeding the threshold the appliance may repeat steps .

In some embodiments if the client message indicates that the window size of the client is no longer below the predetermined value the appliance may return the client request to the surge queue and repeat steps for a second client. In a further embodiment the appliance may remove any indicator or flag in the surge queue identifying the request as having a window size below the predetermined threshold.
