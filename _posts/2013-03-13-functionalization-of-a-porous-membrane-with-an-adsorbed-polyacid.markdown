Priority is claimed to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 611 704 filed on Mar. 16 2012 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This invention was made with government support under GM080511 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The disclosure relates to a process and related article for functionalizing a porous membrane by contacting the membrane with a polyacid polymer at low pH to stably adsorb a polyacid layer on the membrane pore surface. The process allows functionalization of porous membranes in a very simple one step process. Such functional membranes may find multiple uses including rapid selective binding of proteins for their purification or immobilization.

Affinity adsorption of tagged recombinant proteins is a vital step in their purification. Remarkably specific binding of the tagged protein to ligands immobilized in packed columns often leads to eluted protein purities 90 . However slow diffusion of large macromolecules into the affinity resin sometimes results in long separation times that are particularly deleterious for purification of sensitive proteins or their complexes. In large scale affinity adsorption column packing is also challenging and high pressure drops may occur.

The disclosure relates to a process and corresponding article for functionalizing a porous membrane by contacting the membrane with a polyacid polymer at low pH e.g. generally less than 4 to stably adsorb a polyacid layer on the surfaces of the membrane pores. As illustrated in the examples it was unexpectedly found that a polyacid polymer with pendent free acid groups e.g. poly acrylic acid PAA could be stably and directly adsorbed on a membrane surface. It was previously thought that an intermediate adhesion layer having both a high hydrophobic character and available ionic groups e.g. poly styrene sulfonate PSS having hydrophobic aromatic rings and ionic sulfonate groups was required to adhere to the membrane material and provide a basis for the layer by layer growth adsorption of other polymeric layers having desired functionalities. It was further thought that higher pH values e.g. generally at or above the isoelectric point of a given polymer to be adsorbed were required to form a well adhered stable polymeric film e.g. at a pH value above 4 to 4.5 as an approximate isoelectric point for PAA . As shown in the application examples however it was found that polyacid polymers could be stably adsorbed at low pH values and further that no adhesion layers were necessary. Further the membrane adsorbed polyacid polymers were found to have a high density of free acid groups which could be used directly as functional groups for an ion exchange process or which could be further derivatized for any desired application e.g. selective binding of proteins for purification or immobilization . Thus the disclosed process and resulting article exhibit a synergy in that the low pH process provides both i a favorable adhesion process for the polyacid polymer e.g. resulting in a structurally stable functionalized membrane article and ii an increased density of free acid groups e.g. resulting in a functionalized membrane with a higher specific capacity activity for its intended application .

In one aspect the disclosure relates to a method for functionalizing a porous membrane the method comprising a providing a porous membrane substrate comprising a plurality of membrane pores and b contacting the membrane pores with an aqueous fluid mixture i having a pH value less than 3.8 and ii comprising a polyacid polymer comprising pendent free acid groups selected from the group consisting of carboxylic acid groups COOH carboxylate groups COO and combinations thereof for a time sufficient to stably adsorb a polyacid layer on surfaces of the membrane pores thereby forming a polyacid coated porous membrane comprising the free acid groups. Alternatively or additionally the pH value of the aqueous fluid mixture can be at least 0.2 0.4 0.6 or 0.8 pH units less than the isoelectric point of the polyacid polymer. The free acid groups generally are not paired to another group e.g. such as when a carboxylic acid group is covalently bound to another functional group via a reaction product such as amide or ester or such as when a carboxylate group is ionically paired to a cation such as in an adjacent polycation layer .

Various refinements and extensions of the functionalization method and resulting functionalized membrane are possible.

For example the plurality of membrane pores can have an average pore size of at least 0.02 m 0.1 m 0.2 m 0.5 m 1 m or 2 m and or up to 3 m 4 m 5 m 6 m 8 m 10 m 20 m or 50 m. The foregoing sizes ranges can additionally or alternatively represent bounds of a pore size distribution in the membrane. A size range of about 0.5 m to about 10 m is suitable for example for protein isolation applications in particular when the sample containing the protein to be isolated purified is admixed with other larger non target interfering components such as cell lysate products. Lower pore sizes down to about 0.1 m can be used for samples without larger interfering matter such as for isolation of small proteins without cell lysate products and or isolation of metal ions e.g. generally with the free acid group or with some metal specific ligand based on further derivation such as to capture a Cu byproduct of a click chemistry reaction system . Other pore sizes e.g. up to about 50 m can be used to target other analytes for example including oligonucleotides DNA and or microorganisms such as bacteria viruses and or characteristic oligonucleotides DNA thereof e.g. using an analyte complementary antibody or probe oligonucleotide DNA immobilized via derivatization of the polyacid free acid groups to provide a membrane functionalized with a capture probe analyte binding pair member .

In various embodiments the porous membrane substrate can comprise a synthetic polymeric membrane material selected from the group consisting of cellulose acetates nitrocelluloses cellulose esters polysulfones polyether sulfones polyacrylonitriles polyamides nylons polyimides polyethylenes polypropylenes polytetrafluoroethylenes polyvinylidene fluorides polyvinylchlorides hydroxylated derivatives of the foregoing and combinations thereof. Hydroxyl group containing materials e.g. which can be present in the native form of the polymeric membrane material or as a hydroxylated derivative of the polymeric membrane material can be useful to promote hydrogen bonding interactions with the polyacid. Such hydroxyl functionality is not required however since hydrophobic interactions among others between the membrane material and the polyacid backbone can provide substantial adhesion forces as well.

In an embodiment at least 50 60 70 80 90 or 95 of the polyacid free acid groups in the aqueous fluid mixture are in the form of carboxylic acid groups COOH . Alternatively or additionally at least some of the free acid groups can be in carboxylate form COO such as at least 5 10 or 20 and or up to 10 20 30 40 or 50 . At least some carboxylate groups can be desirable in multi layer films so that the polyacid layer has some ionic groups to promote interlayer adhesion with neighboring polycation layers. Conversely in membranes functionalized with only a monolayer of polyacid the polyacid can have any desired level of carboxylic groups and exhibit good adhesion properties for example where all or substantially all free acid groups are in the form of carboxylic acid groups. The foregoing values for carboxylic acid and carboxylate content apply to the free acid groups of the polyacid layer as deposited on the membrane as well although they need not be identical to those of the original polyacid polymer in the aqueous fluid mixture prior to deposition.

As noted above the polyacid coated porous membrane deposited according to the disclosed methods has a substantially higher free acid group content relative to equivalent polyacid layers deposited at higher pH values. For example the polyacid coated porous membrane can have a free acid group content of at least 1.25 1.5 1.75 2 2.5 3 or 4 and or up 3 4 5 6 8 or 10 times that of an analogous polyacid coated porous membrane in which the aqueous fluid mixture containing the polyacid to be deposited had a higher reference pH value such as 4 or 5. This relative free acid group content can be determined approximated for example by measuring a chemical moiety such as a ligand bound metal e.g. NTA complexed Cu or Ni that corresponds to the free acid group content of the as deposited polyacid. In this example the metal binding ligand selectively binds to the free acid groups during derivatization attachment to provide a measurable correlation to the free acid group content of the polyacid layer as initially deposited e.g. by measuring the metal binding capacity of the derivatized coated membrane . The metal ion may also bind to the free carboxylic acid groups e.g. underivatized groups in the film.

In the functionalized membrane the polyacid layer can be stably adsorbed on the surfaces of the membrane pores due to various interactions such as one or more of hydrophobic interactions hydrogen bonding interactions and coordination interactions. In an embodiment the polyacid membrane adhesion forces are free or substantially free of covalent substrate attachments e.g. such as when the polyacid is adsorbed directly on the substrate . In another embodiment the polyacid membrane adhesion forces are free or substantially free of ionic attachment forces to the substrate. In other instances however ionic forces may be present such as when the polyacid is adsorbed on an intervening polycation layer or when the membrane material has ionic functional groups. The adsorbed polyacid layer is resistant to high pH treatment such as a rinse with sodium hydroxide or other strong base for membrane decontamination and re use e.g. allowing the membrane to be treated decontaminated without removing or otherwise substantially degrading the adsorbed functionalized polyacid layer . After the basic rinse the membrane can be rinsed reconditioned with DI water and or a suitable sample buffer e.g. such as a buffer for sample delivery or target analyte elution .

The specific polyacid polymer used is not particularly limited but it suitably comprises repeating units having one or more pendent free acid groups. In many embodiments the polyacid polymer has an ethylenic backbone. For example the polyacid polymer can include mono acid repeating units e.g. acrylic acid and methacrylic acid repeating units and or poly acid repeating units e.g. itaconic acid and maleic acid as examples of di acids either in a homopolymer or copolymer. Suitable homopolymers can include poly acrylic acid PAA and poly methacrylic acid . Suitable copolymers can include other acid containing repeating units or other non acid containing units e.g. alkylene derived repeating units such as ethylene propylene etc. . In an embodiment a monomer of the polyacid repeating unit can be represented by RRC CRR where R Rare independently selected from H and carbon containing groups having from 1 or 2 to 4 6 or 8 carbons e.g. a hydrocarbon group such as an alkyl group potentially in addition to one or more N O S heteroatoms. At least one of R Ris a carbon containing group having one or more free acid groups e.g. R Rare H and Ris COOH or COO for acrylic acid acrylate R Rare H Ris CH and Ris COOH or COO for methacrylic acid methacrylate .

In a refinement the polyacid polymer can comprise repeating units that comprise a metal binding ligand group. In various embodiments the metal binding ligand group can itself include the free acid group s of the polyacid or the free acid groups can be separate from the metal binding portion of the polyacid polymer. Suitably the metal binding ligand group contains at least one e.g. 1 2 3 4 or more than 4 nitrogen atom and or at least one e.g. 1 2 3 4 or more than 4 free acid group such as an acetic acid group to provide a polydentate metal binding group. In an embodiment a monomer of the polyacid repeating unit can be represented by RNRR. Ris a carbon containing group having from 2 or 4 to 4 6 8 10 or 12 carbons e.g. a hydrocarbon group such as an alkylene or aromatic group potentially in addition to one or more N O S heteroatoms that contains at least one ethylenic unsaturation for polymerization. Rand Rare independently selected from H or carbon containing groups having from 1 or 2 to 4 6 or 8 carbons e.g. a hydrocarbon group such as an alkyl group potentially in addition to one or more N O S heteroatoms where at least one of Rand Ris a carbon containing group having one or more free acid groups e.g. at least one of Rand Ris or contains a COOH or COO group . In one refinement of this embodiment Ris HC CH CH and Rand Rare CHCOOH to provide a polymerizable tridentate metal binding iminodiacetic group e.g. a polyacid polymer including a N 2 propenyl iminodiacetic acid monomer unit . In another refinement of this embodiment Ris HC CH C COOH H and Rand Rare CHCOOH to provide a polymerizable tetradentate metal binding nitrilotriacetic group analogous to that of aminobutyl NTA e.g. a polyacid polymer including a N 1 carboxy 2 propenyl iminodiacetic acid monomer unit . The polyacid polymers which themselves include the metal binding ligand group can be homopolymers of the given repeating unit or they can be copolymers with other repeating units e.g. acrylic acid or otherwise .

A variety of conditions may be used to deposit adsorb the polyacid from the aqueous fluid medium onto the porous membrane. For example the pH value of the aqueous fluid mixture can be at least 1 1.5 or 2 and or up to 2 2.5 3 3.2 or 3.5 e.g. depending on the particular polyacid and or to control the relative distribution of free acid groups between the carboxylic acid form and the carboxylate form . Alternatively or additionally the deposition pH can be specified relative to the isoelectric point of the polyacid such that the pH of the aqueous fluid mixture is at least 0.2 0.5 0.8 1 1.5 2 or 2.5 and or up to 2 2.5 3 or 3.5 units less than the isoelectric point of the polyacid polymer. Suitably the aqueous fluid mixture is in the form of an aqueous solution comprising the polyacid polymer and further comprising an electrolyte e.g. an inorganic salt in solution.

The polyacid layer can be adsorbed onto the porous membrane surfaces in various structural embodiments. For example the polyacid layer can be adsorbed directly on the porous membrane substrate e.g. no adhesion layer such as poly styrene sulfonate PSS or other polyelectrolyte is required as an intermediate between the membrane substrate and the polyacid . In an alternative embodiment the polyacid layer is immobilized on the porous membrane substrate via one or more adhesion layers wherein at least one of the adhesion layers is adsorbed directly on the porous membrane substrate e.g. an adhesion layer such as poly styrene sulfonate or other polyelectrolyte such as in the PSS PAH PAA embodiment illustrated in the examples . In another embodiment the polyacid coated porous membrane has a monolayer of the polyacid polymer adsorbed directly on the porous membrane substrate and comprising the free acid groups e.g. the single PAA embodiment adsorbed directly on the polymeric membrane surface and illustrated in the examples . In another embodiment the polyacid coated porous membrane substrate comprises a plurality of polyacid layers wherein i a first polyacid layer is adsorbed directly on the porous membrane substrate and ii one or more further polyacid layers are adhered to adjacent polyacid layers via one or more intervening polycation layers e.g. polyethyleneimine PEI or poly allyl amine PAH such as in the PAA PAH PAA and PAA PEI PAA embodiments illustrated in the examples . Such multilayer structures can be formed by performing a layer by layer polyelectrolyte adsorption process to deposit alternate layers of i the polyacid at a pH value less than 3.8 and ii the polycation. The polycation layers are suitably deposited at the same or similar pH value as that of the polyacid layers but higher pH values above 3.8 or 4 can be used . While a higher pH deposition of the polycation could decrease the amount of free acid groups in the bulk interior of the film the outermost polyacid layer will exhibit the desired high free acid group level as a result of having been deposited under the low pH conditions in the final layer by layer deposition step. In any of the foregoing embodiments the low pH adsorption of the polyacid still results in a high density of free acid groups in the membrane.

In an extension the method for functionalizing a porous membrane can further comprise c derivatizing the free acid groups of the polyacid coated porous membrane to covalently attach other functional groups such as protein affinity tag binding ligands thereto at surfaces exposed to membrane pore void volumes. In various embodiments the protein affinity tag binding ligands are selected from the group consisting of polyhistidine tag binding ligands e.g. metallic ions such as Ni or Cu which are in turn immobilized in a suitable metal ligand complex glutathione glutathione S transferase GST tag binding derivatives thereof amylose maltose binding protein MBP tag binding derivatives thereof chitin and chitin binding protein CBP tag binding derivatives thereof. Suitable derivatives of the MBP and CBP tag binding ligands can represent the inclusion of a linking group for covalent attachment of the affinity tag binding ligand to the free acid groups as well as a potential non polymeric form of amylose chitin with sufficient 1 4 bound glucose or N acetylglucosamine residues for specific binding to an MBP tag or CBP tag respectively.

In a refinement derivatization of the free acid groups can comprise c 1 derivatizing the free acid groups of the polyacid coated porous membrane to covalently attach metal binding ligands thereto at surfaces exposed to membrane pore void volumes and c 2 contacting the metal binding ligands with metallic ions to form stable metal ligand complexes at the surfaces exposed to membrane pore void volumes e.g. where the bound metals in turn serve as binding ligands for a protein affinity tag such as a polyhistidine tag . In various embodiments the metallic ions comprise one or more of Ni Cu Co Fe and Ga. In another embodiment the metal binding ligands can comprise one or more of nitrilotriacetic acid groups e.g. aminobutyl NTA that has been amide linked to free acid groups of the polyacid iminodiacetic acid groups and salts thereof e.g. including carboxylate forms thereof .

In another aspect the disclosure relates to a polyacid coated porous membrane as generally formed according to the disclosed method in any of its various embodiments e.g. including the polyacid as deposited or after further derivatization to include binding ligands such as protein affinity tag binding ligands either with or without a bound affinity tagged protein .

In an embodiment the polyacid coated porous membrane comprises a a porous membrane substrate comprising a plurality of membrane pores and b a polyacid layer adsorbed on surfaces of the membrane pores the polyacid layer comprising a polyacid polymer comprising pendent free acid groups selected from the group consisting of carboxylic acid groups carboxylate groups and combinations thereof wherein the polyacid layer is stably adsorbed on the surfaces of the membrane pores and is substantially free of covalent attachments to the surfaces of the membrane pores. The polyacid functionalized porous membrane is suitably free or substantially free of covalent bonds formed between the polyacid and the polymeric material of the porous membrane substrate e.g. having been formed in the absence of conditions intended to create covalent attachments to the substrate although some incidental linking reactions could occur in principle . In a refinement the polyacid layer is stably adsorbed on the surfaces of the membrane pores due to one or more of hydrophobic interactions hydrogen bonding interactions and coordination interactions.

In another aspect the disclosure relates to a method for binding a positively charged target analyte the method comprising a providing the polyacid coated porous membrane formed according to any of the variously disclosed embodiments e.g. including free acid groups but without necessarily having been further derivatized functionalized with a target specific capture ligand b providing a feed fluid sample comprising a positively charged target analyte c passing the feed fluid sample through the polyacid coated porous membrane thereby i binding at least some of the target analyte with the free acid groups and ii providing a permeate fluid with at least some of the target analyte removed and optionally d eluting the bound target analyte from the polyacid coated porous membrane thereby forming a purified permeate fluid comprising the target analyte. In a refinement i the feed fluid sample further comprises non positively charged non target analytes and ii the purified permeate fluid is substantially free from the non target analytes.

In another aspect the disclosure relates to a method for binding an affinity tagged target protein the method comprising a providing the polyacid coated porous membrane formed according to any of the variously disclosed embodiments and including a protein affinity tag binding ligand b providing a feed fluid sample comprising a target protein comprising an affinity tag c passing the feed fluid sample through the polyacid coated porous membrane thereby i binding at least some of the target protein via the affinity tag with the immobilized protein affinity tag binding ligands and ii providing a permeate fluid with at least some of the target protein removed and optionally d eluting the bound target protein from the polyacid coated porous membrane thereby forming a purified permeate comprising the target protein. In a refinement i the feed fluid sample further comprises non target proteins and ii the purified permeate is substantially free from the non target proteins e.g. non target proteins without an affinity tag in general or without the affinity tag appropriate for the specific membrane .

Various embodiments for the protein affinity tag binding ligand are possible. In one embodiment i the affinity tag is a polyhistidine tag and ii the protein affinity tag binding ligands comprise one or more of Ni ligand complexes and Co ligand complexes.

Additional features of the disclosure may become apparent to those skilled in the art from a review of the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings examples and appended claims.

While the disclosed processes compositions and methods are susceptible of embodiments in various forms specific embodiments of the disclosure are illustrated in the drawings and will hereafter be described with the understanding that the disclosure is intended to be illustrative and is not intended to limit the claims to the specific embodiments described and illustrated herein.

Typical membrane modification includes polymerization from the surface. This is a relatively complex process and often includes initiator attachment to the membrane. The current approach involves adsorption of a polyacid to the membrane. Hydrophobic interactions strongly attach the polymer to the surface. Although others have modified membranes through polymer adsorption a feature of the disclosed process is adsorption at low pH to maintain a low fraction of ionized groups and promote the formation of highly swollen films after deprotonation of the acid groups. These highly swollen films rapidly bind large amounts of protein and can be further functionalized. The method is much more convenient than previous approaches to membrane modification. Protein binding capacities are higher than for commercial membranes.

The process involves simple passage of a polyacid solution through a membrane at low pH. Additional layers may be deposited by sequentially adsorbing polycations along with the polyanion at low pH. Subsequent binding at neutral pH leads to a high density of ion exchange sites for protein binding. Derivatization of the acid groups with ligands such as Ni complexes allows selective binding of tagged proteins such as those containing polyhistidine.

Similar to illustrates a method of binding capturing and or recovering an affinity tagged target protein analyte from a fluid sample. As shown in a feed fluid containing or suspected of containing an affinity tagged target protein analyte P is fed through the functionalized membrane . While not particularly limited suitable affinity tags include polyhistidine His tags glutathione S transferase GST tags maltose binding protein MBP tags and chitin binding protein CBP tags. As the feed fluid passes through the membrane the affinity tag binding ligands can bind at least some of the protein analyte P thus forming some at least some analyte bound ligand groups LP e.g. where some unbound ligands also can remain . The feed fluid is removed from the membrane as a permeate fluid in which at least some of the protein analyte P has been removed from the feed e.g. complete or substantially complete removal of the protein analyte P provided that the membrane binding capacity is not exceeded . Optionally the protein analyte P can be recovered removed from the membrane e.g. to recover the protein analyte P as a product and or to regenerate the membrane for further use . An elution wash fluid is fed to the membrane removing at least some or all of the protein analyte P from the analyte bound ligand groups LP to provide an eluate purified permeate fluid including the protein analyte P.

The following examples illustrate the disclosed processes and compositions but are not intended to limit the scope of any claims thereto.

Layer by layer polyelectrolyte adsorption is a simple convenient method for introducing ion exchange sites in porous membranes. This example demonstrates that adsorption of poly acrylic acid PAA containing films at pH 3 rather than pH 5 increases the protein binding capacity of such polyelectrolyte modified membranes 3 to 6 fold. The low adsorption pH generates a high density of COOH groups that function as either ion exchange sites or points for covalent immobilization of metal ion complexes that selectively bind tagged proteins. When functionalized with nitrilotriacetate NTA Ni complexes membranes containing PAA polyethyleneimine PEI PAA films bind 93 mg of histidine tagged His tagged Ubiquitin per cmof membrane. Additionally these membranes isolate His tagged COP9 signalosome complex subunit 8 from cell extracts and show 90 recovery of His tagged proteins. Although modification with polyelectrolyte films occurs by simply passing polyelectrolyte solutions through the membrane for as little as 5 min with low pH deposition the protein binding capacities of such membranes are as high as for membranes modified with polymer brushes and 2 3 fold higher than for commercially available IMAC resins. Moreover the buffer permeabilities of polyelectrolyte membranes that bind His tagged protein are 30 of the corresponding permeabilities of unmodified membranes so protein capture can occur rapidly with low pressure drops. Even at a solution linear velocity of 570 cm h membranes modified with PAA PEI PAA exhibit a lysozyme dynamic binding capacity capacity at 10 breakthrough of 40 mg cm. Preliminary studies suggest that these membranes are stable under depyrogenation conditions 1 M NaOH .

Porous membranes modified with affinity ligands offer a potential solution to some of the challenges in column based affinity separations. Convection through the membrane pores and short radial diffusion distances provide rapid protein transport to binding sites and increasing the membrane surface area is a relatively straightforward strategy to scale up membrane processes. Unfortunately membrane adsorbers suffer from low binding capacities relative to traditional columns. A number of research groups successfully modified membranes with polymer brushes to increase the number of binding sites and enhance binding capacity but brush growth is a relatively cumbersome process frequently requiring both deposition of initiator molecules and polymerization under anaerobic conditions.

The layer by layer LbL adsorption at pH values of 4 or higher of polyelectrolyte multilayers in nylon with 5 m pores was previously examined and it was determined that it could effectively create ion exchange membranes. Modification of membranes using LbL adsorption which simply involves passing a few aqueous solutions through the membrane is extremely convenient but the lysozyme binding capacities of those membranes were at most 16 mg cm. Commercial ion exchange Mustang S membranes already show lysozyme binding capacities of 45 50 mg cm.

These examples demonstrate that control of the pH employed during deposition of weak polyelectrolytes can greatly increase the protein binding capacities of membranes modified with polyelectrolyte multilayers. A number of papers report that changes in the deposition pH of poly acrylic acid PAA protonated poly allyl amine PAH multilayer coatings greatly alter film properties including thickness swelling metal adsorption capacity permeability and biocompatibility. Additionally recent work shows that deposition of PAH PAA films on flat surfaces at pH 3 rather than pH 5 leads to a 6 fold increase in lysozyme adsorption. Thus it is thought that in membranes PAH PAA adsorption at low pH would give a high density of free COOH groups that bind cationic proteins through ion exchange interactions. By free the meaning is that the COOH groups are not deprotonated and not ion paired with neighboring ammonium groups of PAH during deposition. Moreover derivatization of the free COOH groups by reaction with aminobutyl nitrilotriacetate NTA should yield metal ion complexes that selectively bind tagged proteins . Remarkably membranes modified with PAA polycation PAA films deposited at pH 3 bind as much as 120 mg lysozyme per cmof membrane which is comparable to the capacities of the best membranes modified with polymer brushes. Additionally after derivatization with NTA Ni complexes these membranes can capture His tagged proteins from cell extracts and facilitate 95 protein recovery at high purity. The simplicity of LbL adsorption and the high performance of these membranes make them very attractive for protein purification.

Hydroxylated nylon LOPRODYNE LP Pall 1.2 m pore size 110 m thick nylon GE non hydroxylated 1.2 m pore size average thickness 95 m and polyethersulfone GE 1.2 m pore size average thickness 130 m membranes were cut into 25 mm diameter discs prior to use. Unless specified all proteins and chemicals were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. Coomassie protein assay reagent Thermo Scientific Histidine tagged Ubiquitin HisU human recombinant Enzo Life Sciences concanavalin A Con A from Jack bean albumin from chicken egg white lysozyme from chicken egg white bovine serum albumin BSA and Lactoglobulin B from Bovine milk were used as received. His tagged COP9 signalosome complex subunit 8 CSN 8 was overexpressed in BL21 DE3 cells as described below. Buffers were prepared using analytical grade chemicals and deionized water Milli Q 18.2 M cm . Poly sodium 4 styrenesulfonate M 70 000 poly allylamine hydrochloride M 120 000 210 000 Alfa Aesar polyethyleneimine branched M 25 000 poly acrylic acid Mw 90 000 25 aqueous solution Polysciences TWEEN 20 surfactant N 3 dimethylaminopropyl N ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride EDC N hydroxysuccinimide and N N bis carboxymethyl L lysine hydrate aminobutyl NTA were used without further purification.

Membrane discs were cleaned for 10 min with UV ozone and placed in a homemade TEFLON holder similar to an Amicon cell that exposed 3.1 cm.sup.2 of external membrane surface area. Subsequently a 20 mL solution containing 0.02 M PSS and 0.5 M NaCl was circulated through the membrane for 40 min at a flow rate of 1 mL min using a peristaltic pump. Additional polycation PAH or PEI and polyanion PAA layers were deposited similarly using 0.5 M NaCl solutions containing 0.01 M PAA or 0.02 M PAH or 2 mg mL PEI. After deposition of each polyelectrolyte 20 mL of water was passed through the membrane at the same flow rate. The pH of the PSS solution was 4.7 and PAA PAH and PEI deposition solutions were adjusted to different values with 1 M NaOH or 1M HCl. Membrane hydraulic permeabilities were determined as described previously.

To derivatize PAA side chains in adsorbed films 10 mL of 0.1 M NHS 0.1 M EDC in water were circulated through the membrane for 1 h prior to rinsing with 20 mL of deionized water and 10 mL of ethanol. Subsequently 10 mL of aqueous aminobutyl NTA 0.1 M pH 10.2 was circulated through the NHS modified substrate for 1 h followed by rinsing with 20 mL of water. Finally the NTA Cu or Ni complex was formed by circulating 10 mL of aqueous 0.1 M CuSO or NiSO through the membrane for 2 h followed by rinsing with water. The substrate was dried with Nprior to protein binding.

Previous work has shown that PSS serves as a robust adhesion layer for deposition of polyelectrolyte multilayers in a variety of membranes. Multiple hydrophobic interactions likely lead to strong PSS adsorption. A PAH PAA bilayer was deposited on PSS adsorbed in a 1.2 m nylon membrane. This procedure requires no organic solvents or anaerobic conditions and is much simpler than modification of membranes with polymer brushes. Moreover because the fraction of ionized COOH groups on an adsorbed PAA monolayer varies from 60 on going from pH 2 to pH 5 variation of deposition pH provides an important variable for modifying film properties. Deposition of PAA at low pH leads to films that contain free COOH groups and subsequent derivatization or deprotonation of these groups should lead to a high density of protein binding sites.

Monitoring polyelectrolyte adsorption in nylon membranes is challenging. SEM images suggest a decrease in porosity after deposition of polyelectrolytes but such images are only qualitative and do not reflect film swelling . The water permeability of nylon membranes decreases significantly after polyelectrolyte adsorption and the decrease is most significant for deposition of polyelectrolytes at low pH Table 1 below . Moreover with film deposition at low pH membrane permeability increases after derivatization with NTA Cu complexes presumably because of a decrease in swelling Table 2 below . Nevertheless in control experiments even bare nylon membranes showed a 30 50 decline in hydraulic pure water permeability after exposure to 20 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 . Thus although water permeabilities suggest greater polyelectrolyte adsorption at low pH they do not provide a quantitative measure of polyelectrolyte adsorption.

The amount of Cu that binds to membranes modified with PSS PAH PAA NTA Cu likely reflects the density of free COOH groups in the membrane. Table 3 column 5 shows that the quantity of Cu captured in these membranes dramatically increases with a decrease in the pH of PAH and PAA adsorption. This increase likely reflects enhancements in both the film thickness and availability of free COOH or COO groups for activation and reaction with aminobutyl NTA. Considering the membrane modified with PSS PAH PAA NTA using a deposition pH of 2 the Cu binding capacity of 15 mg cmsuggests that there is 75 mg cmof polymer in the membrane. This estimation assumes complete derivatization to give a repeat unit molecular weight of 316 for PAA NTA and neglects the amount of PSS and PAH in the membranes as well as PAA repeat units that interact with PAH and cannot be derivatized. The total amount of polymer in the membrane could easily be twice the calculated value.

While a PSS adhesion layer is important for forming stable polyelectrolyte films in nylon membranes adsorption of PAA directly in nylon pores without an adhesion layer also provides a remarkably simple way to introduce a high density of functional groups in these systems. In principle PAA might adsorb to nylon membranes through hydrophobic interactions or hydrogen bonds. Similar to membranes modified with PSS PAH PAA the Cu binding capacities of PAA films deposited at pH 2 and pH 3 and subsequently modified with aminobutyl NTA are 4 to 6 fold higher than the capacities of corresponding films deposited at pH 4 and 5 Table 3 column 5 . Thus the total amount of adsorbed PAA may be 5 fold higher when comparing films deposited at pH 2 or 3 with films deposited at pH 5. Notably for films deposited at low pH the Cu binding is similar for membranes modified with PAA and PSS PAH PAA films.

Adsorption of a PAH PAA or PEI PAA bilayer on a PAA base layer can in principle increase the number of free COOH groups in a membrane. However membranes modified with PAA NTA PAA PAH PAA NTA and PAA PEI PAA NTA bind only 12 2 13 1 and 18 2 mg Cu cm respectively all films were deposited at pH 3 as film stability at pH 2 was a concern . Only the PAA PEI PAA NTA coating shows significantly more Cu sorption than simple PAA NTA films. The relatively small increase in bound Cu with the addition of the polycation PAA bilayer reflects the formation of ion pairs between the polycations and underlying PAA and perhaps less extension of the outer PAA layer when adsorption occurs on the polycation rather than directly on a membrane. Notably adsorption of PAA on the branched PEI apparently leads to more derivatizable COOH groups than adsorption on linear PAH.

In addition to NTA Cu may bind to underivatized COOH groups and complicate the interpretation of Cu binding data. Thus Cu binding was compared to PAA PEI PAA and PAA PEI PAA NTA membranes. The binding was 30 higher for the NTA derivatized membrane but significant binding does occur to the PAA PEI PAA film. This is not surprising given the large number of free COOH groups in the film. Even with the NTA derivatized coating some fraction of the Cu binding likely occurs to underivatized COOH groups. Attempts to selectively elute the Cu binding to underivatized COOH groups were unsuccessful.

Plugging of membrane pores is always a potential problem when modifying membranes by adsorption. The permeability of membranes to pH 7.4 phosphate buffer 20 mM decreases from around 70 to 20 mL cmmin atm when comparing a bare membrane and a membrane containing a PAA PEI PAA film. Although this is a significant decline in permeability rapid flow through the membrane can still occur using a simple peristaltic pump even after derivatization with NTA. In contrast the permeability of PAA PEI PAA modified membranes to deionized water after treatment with buffer is 

A solution of lysozyme 0.30 or 0.45 mg mL in 20 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 was pumped through the modified membrane at a flow rate of 1 or 30 mL min and the permeate was collected for analysis at specific time intervals. Subsequently the membrane was rinsed with 20 mL of washing buffer A 20 mM phosphate buffer with 0.1 Tween 20 pH 7.4 followed by 20 mL of phosphate buffer. The protein was then eluted using 5 10 mL of 20 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 containing 1 M KSCN. Unless specified flow rates were 1 mL min.

Deposition of polyanion terminated films in membrane pores creates cation exchange sites that bind positively charged proteins such as lysozyme molecular weight 14.3 kDa which at pH 7.4 has a charge of 8. presents breakthrough curves for passage of 0.3 mg mL lysozyme in pH 7.4 buffer through nylon membranes modified with PSS PAH PAA films deposited at several pH values. When protein begins to saturate the binding sites the lysozyme breaks through the membrane and its effluent concentration eventually reaches that of the feed solution. The later breakthrough in the case of films deposited at pH 2 and 3 demonstrates the higher binding capacities in these systems. Integration of the differences between the feed concentration and the effluent concentration gives the membrane binding capacity and Table 3 column 3 shows that the lysozyme binding capacity for PSS PAH PAA films deposited at pH 3 is 3 times that for films adsorbed at pH 5. Thicker films and higher concentrations of free COOH groups as indicated by Cu binding capacities Table 3 column 5 presumably lead to more binding sites for membranes modified by polyelectrolyte adsorption at low pH. The highest binding at pH 3 rather than pH 2 might relate to film conformation. Binding capacities determined from elution of the lysozyme with 20 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 containing 1 M KSCN agree well with those determined from the breakthrough curves compare columns 3 and 4 of Table 3 .

Table 3 also shows the lysozyme binding capacities of membranes modified by adsorption of PAA PAA PAH PAA and PAA PEI PAA films. show representative breakthrough curves. Maximum binding using a single PAA layer occurs for films deposited at pH 3 which is consistent with the high Cu binding for this membrane see Table 3 column 5 . PAA PAH PAA or PAA PEI PAA multilayers provide 20 30 higher binding capacities than single PAA layers with the PAA PEI PAA film showing especially high capacities. This high lysozyme adsorption with PAA PEI PAA agrees well with data for Cu binding.

To further simplify film formation adsorption time was reduced from 40 min to 5 min for deposition of each polyelectrolyte. Rinsing time was also decreased from 20 min to 5 min. The binding capacity of PAA PEI PAA containing membranes modified using the short deposition times is 108 1 mg cm so reducing the total deposition time 6 fold decreased the binding capacity only 10 . By reducing the adsorption time complete deposition of a PAA PEI PAA film requires only 30 min. Binding capacities are more than 6 fold greater than those in a prior study in part due to the low pH deposition but also because the membranes have smaller pores 1.2 m versus 5 m that lead to higher surface areas.

Compared to column based methods membrane adsorbers are particularly attractive for rapid protein capture because radial diffusion distances are short and convection brings proteins to binding sites. Moreover rapid flow rates are possible because of modest pressure drops. If dynamic capacity is defined as the amount of protein bound when breakthrough reaches 10 typical dynamic capacities for the protein binding studies described above are about of the equilibrium binding capacities. However these experiments all employed flow rates of 1 mL min. To better examine the dynamics of protein binding breakthrough curves were compared for lysozyme binding to PAA PEI PAA modified membranes at solution flow rates of 1 and 30 mL min. These flow rates correspond to linear velocities of 19 cm h and 570 cm h and residence times of 1000 msec and 35 msec respectively. Note that these residence times assume a membrane porosity of 50 whereas the linear velocity is that above the membrane. As shows the breakthrough curves are not very different at the two flow rates and dynamic capacities are similar within about 25 .

As a test of the versatility of layer by layer adsorption for membrane modification polyelectrolyte layers were immobilized in PES and non hydroxylated nylon membranes and lysozyme binding was studied with these systems. For non hydroxylated membranes PSS PAH PAA and PAA PEI PAA films were deposited using a deposition pH of 3 for all polyelectrolytes except PSS. The lysozyme binding capacities for the PSS PAH PAA and PAA PEI PAA modified membranes were 68 3 mg cmand 72 5 mg cm respectively or about 60 of the binding capacities for corresponding hydroxylated nylon membranes. The drop in binding capacity could stem either from less adsorption to the non hydroxylated membrane or a difference in the surface areas of the two substrates. After treating the non hydroxylated membranes with phosphoric acid in formalin to introduce hydroxyl groups PAA PEI PAA adsorption leads to a lysozyme binding capacity of 103 2 105 7 from elution mg cm. Assuming that the formaldehyde treatment does not increase surface area this result suggests that hydroxylation increases the quantity of polyelectrolyte adsorption. Unfortunately PES membranes plugged during deposition of PSS PAH PAA and PAA PEI PAA films. The membrane geometry is obviously a crucial factor in determining whether polyelectrolyte adsorption can occur without plugging the membrane. When a monolayer of PAA deposition pH of 3 was immobilized in the PES membrane the lysozyme binding capacity was only 21 7 mg cm or about 25 of that for a similar hydroxylated nylon membrane. Selection of the appropriate membrane substrate is thus vital to optimizing membranes modified with polyelectrolytes.

In studies of the stability of membranes modified with PAA PEI PAA two membranes were employed for 6 repetitions of lysozyme binding and elution. The binding capacity ranged from 125 to 141 mg cmover the 6 replicates. Thus the membranes are stable although declining flow rates were observed during the 6experiment for both modified membranes. Note that this stability occurs even when using 1 M KSCN for protein elution.

Stability of modified membranes was also tested under depyrogenation conditions. In this case lysozyme was first bound in nylon membranes modified with PAA PEI PAA films deposited at pH 3. After lysozyme elution with 1 M KSCN 10 mL 1 N NaOH was circulated through the modified membranes for 1 h and the binding experiment was repeated. The binding capacities before and after treatment with 1 M NaOH were 131 1 mg cmand 129 3 mg cmrespectively. Thus treatment of the membranes with NaOH to remove or disable toxins prior to reuse might be feasible.

Con A and HisU solutions 0.3 mg mL were prepared in 20 mM phosphate buffer at pH 6 and 7.4 respectively. For Con A washing buffer B 20 mM phosphate buffer containing 0.1 Tween 20 surfactant and 0.15 M NaCl and elution buffer 20 mM phosphate buffer containing 50 mM EDTA were also adjusted to pH 6. In the case of HisU the washing buffer B and elution buffer 0.5 M NaCl 0.5 M imidazole in 20 mM phosphate buffer were maintained at pH 7.4. For both Con A and HisU membranes were loaded with buffered protein solution rinsed with 20 mL washing buffer B followed by 20 mL phosphate buffer at pH 6 or 7.4 and eluted with 8 9 mL of elution buffer. The concentrations of protein in loading rinsing and eluate solutions were determined using a Bradford assay. Each Con A binding capacity was determined with two membranes and the values represent the difference between the average and the data points.

To increase the specificity of protein binding PAA films were derivatized with metal ion complexes that bind proteins containing accessible histidine groups. Initially capture of a readily available protein Con A through interaction with NTA Cu complexes was examined. show representative breakthrough curves for passage of Con A solutions through different modified nylon membranes and Table 4 presents the protein binding capacities determined both from breakthrough curves and protein elution. For modification with either PSS PAH PAA NTA Cu or PAA NTA Cu the Con A binding capacities decrease with an increase in deposition pH following the trend in the amount of Cu bound in the different membranes Table 3 column 5 . Membranes modified with PAA PEI PAA NTA Cu and PAA PAH PAA NTA Cu show the highest Con A binding capacities Table 4 of the membranes tested. Deposition of more polyelectrolyte bilayers might increase capacity but it would also lead to plugging of membrane pores or large decreases in permeability. Overall Con A binding capacities are 35 lower than for lysozyme presumably because the large size of Con A 108 kDa prevents access to some binding sites. Con A also interacts with different species metal ion complexes in the film.

Interactions with histidine residues are weaker for NTA Ni than NTA Cu so the incorporation of NTA Ni complexes in columns and membranes allows highly selective binding of proteins that contain polyhistidine tags. In fact polyhistidine is the most common tag for recombinant protein purification. HisU was employed as a model His tagged protein to determine the binding capacity of modified nylon membranes. Though HisU is the least expensive His tagged protein the high cost of this protein prohibits determining binding capacities on multiple membranes. A PAA PEI PAA NTA Ni modified membrane was selected to determine HisU binding capacity because the related membranes modified with PAA PEI PAA NTA Cu exhibit the most extensive binding of Con A. The breakthrough curve for HisU binding to a PAA PEI PAA NTA Ni modified nylon membrane reveals a HisU binding capacity of 93 mg cm. The corresponding capacity determined from HisU elution 97 mg cm is about twice the value of typical binding capacities of commercial IMAC resins and similar to the capacities 88 4 mg cm that were obtained by modifying nylon membranes with polymer brushes. Additionally the brush containing membranes are more difficult to prepared and less permeable.

To test protein binding specificity and recovery a solution containing 0.05 mg mL each His U Con A BSA Ovalbumin and Lactoglobulin B in 20 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 was prepared. Ten mL of this protein solution was passed through a PAA PEI PAA NTA Ni modified membrane at 1.5 mL min after the membrane was equilibrated with 20 mL phosphate buffer. Subsequently the membrane was washed with 20 mL washing buffer C 20 mM phosphate buffer containing 0.1 Tween 20 surfactant and 150 mM NaCl pH 8.0 and 20 mL phosphate buffer. The bound protein was eluted with 10 mL 2 mL for each fraction elution buffer 20 mM phosphate buffer with 500 mM imidazole and 500 mM NaCl pH 8.0 . The purity of eluted protein was examined by SDS PAGE 4 20 gradient gel from Bio Rad with standard Coomassie blue staining protocols .

To demonstrate the selectivity of PAA PEI PAA Ni modified membranes for capture of His tagged proteins HisU was first separated from a mixture of HisU Con A BSA Ovalbumin and Lactoglobulin B. These model proteins except HisU do not have His tags and serve as contaminating proteins in this experiment. SDS PAGE analysis of the mixed protein solution exiting the membrane suggests successful removal of HisU lane 3 while the eluate shows only bands due to HisU lane 4 note that even the as received HisU shows two bands . Thus the membranes are highly selective for capturing HisU.

In addition to selectivity high recovery is important in most protein purifications. The high purity of the eluted HisU as demonstrated by gel electrophoresis allowed the use of a Bradford assay to demonstrate that recovery was 95 3 even with the loading washing and elution steps.

The CSN8 orf was obtained through the Genomics Resource Center and sub cloned into the his SUMO modified pet28b vector Novagen . The plasmid was transformed into BL21 DE3 codon plus Stratagene competent cells. Colonies were grown in LB broth with Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol at 37 C. until an O.D. of 0.8 was reached. The growth was induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl thio 2 D galactopyranoside IPTG for 16 hours at 16 C. The growth was pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in denaturing buffer containing 6 M urea 10 mM Tris HCl and 100 mM NaHPO at a pH of 8.0. The lysate was sonicated and then centrifuged to pellet the debris. The resulting supernatant was diluted 4 1 with 20 mM pH 8 phosphate buffer containing 10 mM imidazole 300 mM NaCl and 10 glycerol and stored in a 80 C. freezer until use.

At a flow rate of 1.5 mL min the diluted lysate supernatant described above was passed through a PAA PEI PAA NTA Ni modified membrane that was equilibrated with lysate buffer 20 mM pH 8 phosphate buffer containing 10 mM imidazole and 300 mM NaCl . After washing with 20 mL washing buffer B 20 mL washing buffer C 20 mM phosphate buffer containing 45 mM imidazole and 150 mM NaCl and 20 mL phosphate buffer at a flow rate of 5 mL min protein elution and gel electrophoresis followed the same procedure for HisU purification.

Purification of His tagged CSN8 from whole cell extracts further demonstrates the high selectivity and potential applications of membranes modified with PAA PEI PAA Ni. shows the SDS PAGE analysis of the cell extract lane 2 and the eluate from a membrane that was loaded with the cell extract and washed with buffers lane 4 . Remarkably the eluate contains only one strong band suggesting that the purity of the captured CSN8 is above 95 . Moreover the complete membrane purification process requires less than 20 minutes including loading cell lysate on the membrane washing with 3 different buffers and eluting.

At pH 3 adsorption of as little as one layer of PAA in a porous membrane creates a high density of COOH groups that function as either ion exchange sites or points for attachment of metal ion complexes that selectively bind proteins. Increasing the adsorption pH leads to much less protein binding whereas adsorption of a PEI PAA bilayer on the initial PAA layer increases lysozyme binding from 89 to 120 mg cmof membrane. Polyelectrolyte adsorption at low pH is much simpler than growth of polymer brushes in membranes and the binding capacities that result from the two modification methods are similar. Derivatization of PAA PEI PAA modified membranes with NTA Ni complexes yields materials that selectively capture His tagged protein with 90 recovery.
