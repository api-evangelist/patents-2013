No. 12 262 904 filed Oct. 31 2008 entitled BIDIRECTIONAL ITERATIVE BEAM FORMING and U.S. patent application Ser.

Wireless communication systems communicate information over a shared wireless communication medium such as one or more portions of the radio frequency RF spectrum. Recent innovations in Millimeter Wave mmWave communications operating at the 60 Gigahertz GHz frequency band promises several Gigabits per second Gbps throughput within short ranges of approximately 10 meters. Because of the large signal attenuation and limited transmission power many 60 GHz devices will rely on antenna arrays with high directivity gain to achieve the 10 meter coverage. These devices use techniques to steer a beam from a transmitter antenna array around obstacles to find the best path to a receiver antenna array thereby directing much of the antenna gain towards the receiver antenna array. Techniques to discover and direct energy between antenna arrays of peer devices is typically referred to as beam forming or beam steering or beam searching. Beam forming generally attempts to steer an antenna beam at a transmitter while at the same time focusing a receiver antenna in the direction of incoming power from the transmitter. Conventional beam forming protocols however typically take a significant amount of training time before a final high speed communication channel is established between peer devices. Consequently techniques designed to reduce overhead associated with training time are desirable.

Various embodiments may be generally directed to bidirectional iterative beam forming techniques for wireless communication systems. Some embodiments may be particularly directed to an enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol designed to concurrently generate bidirectional communication channels between two or more wireless devices over a wireless network such as a 60 Ghz mmWave wireless video area network WVAN or wireless personal area network WPAN for example. Such networks are sometimes referred to as piconets due to their limited transmission ranges and participating devices. The enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol generates additional antenna gain for directional antenna transmissions thereby allowing training and feedback information to be communicated at a higher data rate resulting in reduced training time and overhead in setting up bidirectional communication channels between two wireless devices.

Since the path loss at 60 GHz band is relatively high and the efficiency of power amplifiers at 60 GHz is relatively low e.g. CMOS power amplifiers directional transmission is needed to achieve the desired coverage area e.g. approximately 10 meters . Namely the antenna array gain from both transmit and receive beam forming is needed to acquire the signal to noise ratio SNR for reliable data communications. A beam forming protocol is typically used to find the optimal phase values which maximize receiver SNR received power or other criterion.

Currently there are several different types of beam forming protocols for implementing directional transmission techniques. A first directional transmission technique is referred to as a sector scan. It forms several directional beams using predefined weights. Calibration is required however in order to form the requisite beams. Another technique is based on singular value decomposition SVD which typically does not require calibration. SVD allows transmission over selected singular values by using the singular vectors for antenna patterns. In particular the singular vector associated with the largest Eigen value typically works well. It is worthy to note however that in order to select the singular values and singular vectors a device typically has to have an estimation of the entire MIMO channel e.g. the channel from every antenna element at the transmitter to every antenna element at the receiver end. While the SVD technique provides improved performance it needs feedback information due to lack of channel reciprocity. This potentially introduces channel delay into the SVD directional transmission technique.

A piconet typically implements two general types of communications transmissions each having different transmission envelopes or characteristics. For example a first type of transmission may be a directional transmission and a second type of transmission may be an omni directional transmission. The different types of transmissions may occur at different transmission rates. For example directional transmissions may be performed using a higher rate channel and the second type of transmission may be performed using a lower rate channel. In a WirelessHD network for example the directional transmissions may be performed using a high rate physical HRP channel and the second type of transmission may be performed using a low rate physical LRP channel. The HRP channel may achieve a higher rate than the LRP channel in part through the utilization of larger amounts of bandwidth.

Since the location of a pair of devices is unknown during initialization conventional techniques typically utilize a combination of LRP channels and HRP channels for beam forming operations. For example one conventional technique utilizes a beam forming protocol for phased array antennas that is based on an iterative training scheme. In one embodiment for example the iterative trainings scheme may comprise a power iteration scheme. This beam forming protocol designed for one way high rate data transmissions over a HRP channel where the reverse link suffers from low rate data transmissions over a LRP channel. Feedback information for the iterative search process is transmitted over the LRP channel which dramatically slows down beam forming operations. This may be acceptable for applications where high rate data transmissions are needed in only one direction such as for video traffic from a media source to a media sink. For applications where high rate data communications are needed in both directions such as for computing centric applications however this introduces unwarranted delay in beam forming operations.

To solve these and other problems various embodiments implement an enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol to perform bidirectional beam forming operations to reduce training overhead and link latency during beam forming operations. Some embodiments delay feedback information until two way transmit or receive beam forming weights are trained and then send the feedback over a beam formed link with a higher rate e.g. HRP channel . This may reduce or eliminate the need to use a LRP channel for beam forming operations. Additionally or alternatively some embodiments interleave transmit and receive beam forming operations to allow use of partially trained links to communicate feedback information at a higher data rate. This reduces the need to use an LRP channel during beam forming operations.

In one embodiment for example a wireless device may include a phased antenna array communicatively coupled to a transceiver. The wireless device may further include an antenna control module communicatively coupled to the transceiver and the phased antenna array. The antenna control module may be arranged to perform beam formation operations using an iterative training scheme to form a pair of communications channels between the wireless device and a peer device. For example the antenna control module may be arranged to communicate training signals and feedback information with the peer device via the transceiver and phased antenna array. The information is communicated using almost exclusively high rate channels or through partial use of low rate channels to bootstrap setup of the high rate channels. This reduces training time for the devices. The antenna control module iteratively determines antenna array weight vectors AWVs for a directional transmit beam pattern for the phased antenna array using feedback information from the peer device. Once trained the wireless devices may be used for high speed bidirectional data communications.

Additionally or alternatively the antenna control module of a wireless device may initiate bidirectional beam formation operations using an iterative training scheme to form a pair of communications channels for a wireless network. The antenna control module may be arranged to interleave transmit and receive beam forming operations for a first wireless device and a second wireless device to allow feedback information received by the first wireless device from the second wireless device to be communicated over a higher data rate channel e.g. HRP channel .

The wireless devices as described herein may coordinate operations between each other. The coordination may involve the uni directional or bi directional exchange of information. In some embodiment the information can be implemented as signals. For example training information may comprise training signals or sequences. Further embodiments however may alternatively employ data messages. The terms training information and feedback information are meant to include both signals and data messages depending on a given implementation. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

Embodiments of the enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol provide several advantages over conventional beam forming techniques. For example the enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol trains both directions of the communications link allowing for a more structured process prior to a bidirectional operation that is more symmetric such as in a PC environment. This provides superior performance relative to conventional beam forming protocols that allows the receiver of the high rate transmission to answer e.g. ACKs etc. in a low rate dedicated physical layer PHY that may not require training of the reverse link. In another example the enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol exploits resources more efficiently. The feedback provided during each iteration is based on partially trained antenna arrays. In yet another example an external listening device can identify transmissions from both ends of the link. This situation is beneficial when an independent station wishes to assess the amount of interference it is going to suffer from the regarded link. If only one side of the link does the transmission however then the station has knowledge about interference only about the forward link and not about the reverse link. These are only a few examples of the advantages provided by the enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol and it may be appreciated that many other advantages exist as well.

In various embodiments the communications system may comprise or form part of a wired communications system a wireless communications system or a combination of both. For example the communications system may include one or more nodes arranged to communicate information over one or more types of wired communication links. Examples of a wired communication link may include without limitation a wire cable bus printed circuit board PCB Ethernet connection peer to peer P2P connection backplane switch fabric semiconductor material twisted pair wire co axial cable fiber optic connection and so forth. The communications system also may include one or more nodes arranged to communicate information over one or more types of wireless communication links. Examples of a wireless communication link may include without limitation a radio channel infrared channel radio frequency RF channel Wireless Fidelity WiFi channel a portion of the RF spectrum and or one or more licensed or license free frequency bands.

The communications system may communicate information in accordance with one or more standards as promulgated by a standards organization. In one embodiment for example various devices comprising part of the communications system may be arranged to operate in accordance with one or more of the WirelessHD specifications standards or variants such as the WirelessHD Specification Revision 1.0d7 Dec. 1 2007 and its progeny as promulgated by WirelessHD LLC collectively referred to as the WirelessHD Specification . The WirelessHD Specification defines a next generation wireless digital network interface for consumer electronic products. Specifically the WirelessHD Specification enables wireless connectivity for streaming high definition content between various wireless devices such as a source device and high definition displays. The WirelessHD Specification defines a wireless protocol that enables the creation of a WVAN. In a current instantiation of the WirelessHD Specification the MAC and PHY are defined to support the wireless delivery of uncompressed high definition audio and video at formats up to 1080 p at 60 Hertz Hz with 24 bit color at a range that is typically at least 10 meters. In addition the delivery of compressed audio visual AV streams and data is also supported at a similar range. An adaptation sub layer enables network and service set up by supporting authentication advanced device and connection control.

Although some embodiments may be described with reference to the WirelessHD Specification by way of example it may be appreciated that the techniques described herein may also be implemented for other wireless standards as promulgated by other standards organizations as well such as the International Telecommunications Union ITU the International Organization for Standardization ISO the International Electrotechnical Commission IEC the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers information IEEE the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF and so forth. In various embodiments for example the communications system may communicate information according to one or more IEEE 802.11 standards for wireless local area networks WLANs such as the information IEEE 802.11 standard 1999 Edition Information Technology Telecommunications and Information Exchange Between Systems Local and Metropolitan Area Networks Specific Requirements Part 11 WLAN Medium Access Control MAC and Physical PHY Layer Specifications its progeny and supplements thereto e.g. 802.11a b g h j n VHT SG and variants IEEE 802.15.3 and variants IEEE 802.16 standards for WMAN including the IEEE 802.16 standard such as 802.16 2004 802.16.2 2004 802.16e 2005 802.16f and variants next generation WirelessHD NGmS progeny and variants European Computer Manufacturers Association ECMA TG20 progeny and variants and other wireless networking standards. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

The communications system may communicate manage or process information in accordance with one or more protocols. A protocol may comprise a set of predefined rules or instructions for managing communication among nodes. In various embodiments for example the communications system may employ one or more protocols such as a beam forming protocol medium access control MAC protocol Physical Layer Convergence Protocol PLCP Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATM protocol Frame Relay protocol Systems Network Architecture SNA protocol Transport Control Protocol TCP Internet Protocol IP TCP IP X.25 Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP User Datagram Protocol UDP and so forth.

The communications system also may be arranged to operate in accordance with standards and or protocols for media processing. Examples of media processing standards include without limitation the High Definition Television HDTV standards as defined by the ITU Radiocommunication Sector ITU R such as the Recommendation BT.709 5 Parameter Values for the HDTV Standards For Production and International Programme Exchange published April 2002 the Digital Video Broadcasting Terrestrial DVB T broadcasting standard the ITU IEC H.263 standard Video Coding for Low Bitrate Communication ITU T Recommendation H.263v3 published November 2000 and or the ITU IEC H.264 standard Video Coding for Very Low Bit Rate Communication ITU T Recommendation H.264 published May 2003 Motion Picture Experts Group MPEG standards e.g. MPEG 1 MPEG 2 MPEG 4 and or High performance radio Local Area Network HiperLAN standards. Examples of media processing protocols include without limitation Session Description Protocol SDP Real Time Streaming Protocol RTSP Real time Transport Protocol RTP Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language SMIL protocol and or Internet Streaming Media Alliance ISMA protocol. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

As shown in the communications system may comprise a transmitter node coupled to a plurality of receiver nodes where n may represent any positive integer value. In various embodiments the transmitter node and the plurality of receiver nodes may be implemented as various types of wireless devices. Examples of wireless devices may include without limitation an IEEE 802.15.3 piconet controller PNC a controller an IEEE 802.11 Private Basic Service Set PBSS Control Point PCP a coordinator a station a subscriber station a base station a wireless access point AP a wireless client device a wireless station STA a laptop computer ultra laptop computer portable computer personal computer PC notebook PC handheld computer personal digital assistant PDA cellular telephone combination cellular telephone PDA smartphone pager messaging device media player digital music player set top box STB appliance workstation user terminal mobile unit consumer electronics television digital television high definition television television receiver high definition television receiver and so forth. In such embodiments the transmitter node and the receiver nodes may comprise one more wireless interfaces and or components for wireless communication such as one or more transmitters receivers transceivers chipsets amplifiers filters control logic network interface cards NICs antennas antenna arrays and so forth. Examples of an antenna may include without limitation an internal antenna an omni directional antenna a monopole antenna a dipole antenna an end fed antenna a circularly polarized antenna a micro strip antenna a diversity antenna a dual antenna an antenna array and so forth. In one embodiment certain devices may include antenna arrays of multiple antennas to implement various adaptive antenna techniques and spatial diversity techniques. Some embodiments for an enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol are discussed in the context of using phased antenna arrays. The enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol may be used with any type of antenna having a need for feedback information and the embodiments are not limited in this respect. For example while some aspects of an enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol are designed to enable a phased antenna array at both ends of the link a switched sector antenna e.g. an antenna with predefined few directions that can switch from one direction to another may still use this protocol.

For purposes of illustration and not limitation examples for an enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol may be given with reference to WirelessHD networks protocols and devices. It may be appreciated however that an enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol may be implemented with other types of networks protocols and devices. For example an enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol may be implemented for a NGmS network protocol or devices and still fall within the intended scope of the embodiments. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

In various embodiments the transmitter node and the receiver nodes may comprise or form part of a wireless network . In one embodiment for example the wireless network may comprise a WVAN as defined by the WirelessHD Specification. In the context of a WVAN both nodes may be implemented as WirelessHD compliant devices. In a WVAN the transmitter node may be communicatively coupled to one or more receiver nodes . In accordance with the WirelessHD Specification and nomenclature one or both of the nodes may be implemented as a coordinator or a station. A coordinator is normally but not always a device that is a sink for media information e.g. audio or video data . The coordinator typically includes a display and in some cases a media storage device such as a personal video recorder PVR media server or STB. A station may comprise a device that either has media information that it can source or sink potentially at the same time.

Although some embodiments may be described with the wireless network implemented as a WVAN network for purposes of illustration and not limitation it can be appreciated that the embodiments are not limited in this context. For example the wireless network may comprise or be implemented as various types of wireless networks and associated protocols suitable for a WPAN a Wireless Local Area Network WLAN a Wireless Metropolitan Area Network a Wireless Wide Area Network WWAN a Broadband Wireless Access BWA network a radio network a television network a satellite network such as a direct broadcast satellite DBS network and or any other wireless communications network configured to operate in accordance with the described embodiments.

As shown in the embodiment of the transmitter node may be coupled to receiver nodes by wireless communication links . A particular wireless communication link e.g. wireless communication link may be arranged to establish one or more common or dedicated connections between the transmitter node and a particular receiver node e.g. receiver node . In various embodiments a particular wireless communication link e.g. wireless communication link may include multiple virtual channels with each of the virtual channels comprising a point to point logical connection from the transmitter node to a particular receiver node e.g. receiver node . In various implementations multiple virtual channels may share a physical link with each virtual channel comprising dedicated resources or bandwidth of the physical link.

In various embodiments the nodes may communicate using a physical layer component PHY such as a high rate PHY HRP . In one embodiment for example the HRP supports multi Gb s throughput at a distance of approximately 10 meters through adaptive antenna technology. Because of this the antenna pattern used for the HRP is highly directional. The HRP is optimized for the delivery of uncompressed high definition video although other data can be communicated using the HRP. To support multiple video resolutions the HRP has more than one data rate defined. The HRP carries isochronous data such as audio and video asynchronous data MAC commands antenna beam forming information and higher layer control data for A V devices. It may be appreciated that the use of HRP and LRP are for WirelessHD devices and other types of PHYs may be used for other types of devices. With respect to the NGmS protocol for example the high rate PHY may be referred to as the OFDM PHY or the SC PHY depending on the modulation type while the low rate PHY is called a CONTROL PHY or a MCS of the SC PHY. In the latter case the low rate transmissions will be based on wide bandwidth with significant processing gain that renders the transmission more robust. Other types of high rate and low rate PHYs may be used for different types of devices and the embodiments are not limited in this context.

In various embodiments the nodes may also communicate using a low rate PHY LRP . The LRP is a multi Mb s bidirectional link that also provides a relatively short range e.g. 10 meters . One or more data rates are defined for the LRP with the lower data rates having near omni directional coverage while the highest data rates are directional although this is not necessarily binding. For example some arrangements may use higher data rates of LRP in almost omni directional transmissions. Because the LRP has near omni directional modes it can be used for both unicast and broadcast connections. Furthermore because all stations support the LRP it can be used for station to station links for WirelessHD devices although this may not be possible for NGmS devices. The LRP supports multiple data rates including directional modes and is used to carry low rate isochronous data such as audio low rate asynchronous data MAC commands including the beacon acknowledgements for HRP packets antenna beam forming information capabilities information and higher layer control data for A V devices.

In some cases not all the HRP and LRP may operate in overlapping frequency bands and so they are coordinated by the MAC. The media access scheme may include a time division multiple access TDMA format a frequency division multiple access FDMA format a TDMA FDMA format a code division multiple access CDMA a wide band CDMA WCDMA format an orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA format and so forth. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

The WVAN typically supports two types of devices. In one embodiment for example a WVAN may support a coordinator and a station. The coordinator controls the timing in the piconet keeps track of the members of the WVAN is able to transmit and receive using the LRP may be able to transmit data using the HRP and may be able to receive data using the HRP. A station is able to transmit and receive using the LRP may initiate stream connections may be able to transmit data using the HRP and may be able to receive data using the HRP. A station may be capable of acting as a coordinator in the WVAN. Such a station is referred to as being coordinator capable.

In addition to the two MAC personalities of coordinator and station each device in a WirelessHD WVAN will have one of four different PHY capabilities as shown in Table 1 as follows 

In various embodiments the transmitter node and the receiver nodes may be arranged to communicate various types of media information in multiple communication frames. The various types of media information may include image information audio information video information AV information and or other data provided from the media source . In various embodiments the information may be associated with one or more images image files image groups pictures digital photographs music file sound files voice information videos video clips video files video sequences video feeds video streams movies broadcast programming television signals web pages user interfaces graphics textual information e.g. encryption keys serial numbers e mail messages text messages instant messages contact lists telephone numbers task lists calendar entries hyperlinks numerical information alphanumeric information character symbols and so forth. The information also may include command information control information routing information processing information system file information system library information software e.g. operating system software file system software application software game software firmware an application programming interface API a program an applet a subroutine an instruction set an instruction computing code logic words values symbols and so forth.

The transmitter node may be arranged to receive media content from a media source node to be unicast and or multicast to one or more of the receiver nodes . In various embodiments the transmitter node may be arranged to receive media content from the source node . The media source node generally may comprise any media source capable of delivering static or dynamic media content to the transmitter node . In one embodiment for example the media source node may comprise a multimedia server arranged to provide broadcast or streaming media content to the transmitter node . In some implementations the media source node may form part of a media distribution system DS or broadcast system such as an over the air OTA broadcast system a radio broadcast system a television broadcast system a satellite broadcast system and so forth. In some implementations the media source node may be arranged to deliver media content pre recorded and stored in various formats for use by a device such as a Digital Versatile Disk DVD device a Video Home System VHS device a digital VHS device a digital camera video camera a portable media player a gaming device and so forth.

As shown in the embodiment of for example the transmitter node may be coupled to the media source node through a communication medium . The communication medium generally may comprise any medium capable of carrying information signals such as a wired communication link wireless communication link or a combination of both as desired for a given implementation. In various embodiments the communication medium may comprise a wired communication link implemented as a wired Ethernet and or P2P connection for example. In such embodiments information may be communicated over the communication medium in accordance with the information IEEE 802.3 and the transmitter node may receive media content from the media source node substantially loss free.

Although some embodiments may be described with the communication medium implemented as a wired Ethernet and or P2P connection for purposes of illustration and not limitation it can be appreciated that the embodiments are not limited in this context. For example the communication medium between the transmitter node and the source node may comprise various types of wired and or wireless communication media and in some cases may traverse one or more networks between such devices.

The transmitter node may be arranged to buffer media content and to parse or fragment the media content into communication frames for unicast or multicast transmission to the receiver nodes . In some implementations the transmitter node may be arranged to parse or fragment the received media content as it is read into a buffer. In some embodiments the media content provided to the transmitter node may be delivered as one or more media frames. Each media frame may comprise a discrete data set having a fixed or varying length and may be represented in terms of bits or bytes such as 16 kilobytes kB for example. It can be appreciated that the described embodiments are applicable to various types of communication content or formats such as frames packets fragments cells units and so forth.

In various embodiments the transmitter node may be arranged to create a sequence of media frames to be broadcast over one or more of the wireless communication links . Each media frame may comprise a discrete data set having fixed or varying lengths and may be represented in terms of bits or bytes. While multicasting each media frame may contain a destination address comprising a group address corresponding to multiple intended recipients such as receiver nodes . In some embodiments the destination address may refer to all receiver nodes within the wireless network .

As shown the wireless network may comprise a wireless device coupled to a wireless device . In various embodiments the wireless communications system may comprise or be implemented by one or more elements of the communications system of such as wireless network transmitter node and receiver nodes . The embodiments are not limited in this context.

In one embodiment for example the wireless device and the wireless device may be implemented as WirelessHD compliant devices and the wireless network may be implemented as a WVAN network. In such an embodiment the wireless network may communicate information in accordance with the WirelessHD Specification and associated techniques and the wireless device may comprise a WirelessHD compliant device communicatively coupled to the wireless device comprising another WirelessHD compliant device. In various implementations the wireless network may support a unicast and or multicast communication environment for distributing media content by unicasting and or multicasting from the wireless device to the wireless device . Typically the wireless devices will utilize unicast or multicast techniques based upon the type of channel being used. For example the wireless devices will utilize unicast techniques when using a HRP channel and multicast techniques when using a LRP channel. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

In one embodiment for example the wireless devices each may include the capability to establish one or more wireless communications channels using respective transceivers coupled to respective antenna control modules coupled to respective phased antenna arrays . In various embodiments the communications channel may be implemented at the MAC layer of the communication protocol stack within a transceiver and or wireless communication chipset of a wireless device.

In the illustrated embodiment shown in the wireless system may comprise a more detailed diagram for a pair of phased antenna arrays implemented for respective wireless devices . The phased antenna arrays may be communicatively coupled to the respective antenna control modules . The phased antenna array may comprise a transmitter antenna array and a receiver antenna array . The phased antenna array may comprise a transmitter antenna array and a receiver antenna array . Although the antenna arrays and the antenna arrays may be illustrated a separate antenna arrays it may be appreciated that each may be implemented using a single antenna array using different transmit and receive coefficients vectors or other suitable antenna parameters.

The transmitter antenna arrays may comprise respective power amplifiers and power amplifiers each coupled to respective phase shifters and phase shifters . The phase shifters and phase shifters may each be coupled to respective antennas and antennas . The receiver antenna arrays may comprise respective antennas and antennas each coupled to respective phase shifters and phase shifters . The phase shifters and phase shifters may each be coupled to respective low noise amplifiers LNA and LNA which are in turn each coupled to respective combiners . It may be appreciated that the transmitter and receiver chains can share phase shifters and or amplifiers as desired for a given implementation. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

The wireless devices may use the respective phased antenna arrays to communicate control information and media information over a wireless shared media . The transmitter antenna array and the receiver antenna array of the respective wireless devices may communicate information using an HRP channel and or a LRP channel . The transmitter antenna array and the receiver antenna array of the respective wireless devices may communicate information using an HRP channel and or a LRP channel . In one embodiment the HRP channels may be implemented as directional channels operating at higher rate data communication speeds and the LRP channels may be implemented as omni directional channels operating at lower rate data communications speeds.

The antenna control modules may use the respective transceivers and respective phased antenna arrays to perform beam forming operations. The beam forming operations may include explicit feedback beam forming which supports all types of WirelessHD compliant devices such as HR0 HRRX HRTX and HRTR. There is no requirement that the transmitter and the receiver for a station are the same and no calibration is required. The beam forming operations may also include implicit feedback beam forming which is typically used when both the source and destination are HRTR capable.

In order to provide data rates on the order of Gbps at approximately 10 meters for 60 GHz mmWave operations the phased antenna arrays are implemented as high gain antenna networks in the 60 GHz frequency band. The phased antenna arrays can create beams that can be steered around obstacles to find a best path between the wireless devices . The antenna control modules may cooperate to implement an enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol suitable for beam search and beam tracking operations. Beam search is a technique of estimating transmitter and receiver antenna array weight vectors AWVs that result in a desired beam with an acceptable level of gain or SNR over the HRP channels . Beam tracking is a technique of tracking transmitter and receivers AWVs that correspond to an existing beam over time due to small perturbations of the HRP channels . While beam search is typically a stand alone technique using a dedicated time interval beam tracking takes place during data transfer and is appended to existing HRP packets and corresponding ACK packets.

The second beam forming protocol uses an iterative training approach. An iterative training process utilizes training sequences and feedback in successive iterations in order to train transmitters or receivers. The iterative training approach provides the advantage of distributing transmit power to multiple power amplifiers and the beam can be adaptively steered. It is worthy to note that this discussion is limited to only a single data stream for purposes of clarity although some embodiments may be implemented for multiple data streams as well. A brief overview of iterative training is provided below to better illustrate and describe the operations and benefits of the enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol.

In one embodiment the desired beam forming weights at the receiver Rx and transmitter Tx denoted by vectors u and v maximize the gain of the beamformed channel as shown in Equation 1 as follows 

Beam forming is needed before the transmission of the data packet. In current protocols and for a P2P scheduled training and for systems without RF transceiver chain calibration the beam forming weights of the phased antenna arrays are gradually refined during the beam refinement phase that consumes a significant overhead of about 400 microseconds s for example. It is desirable to reduce the training overhead as much as possible for high network throughput. In the state of the art iterative training is the scheme employed for the beam refinement because of its superior performance. It is iterative and each iteration has two steps e.g. the training of maximum ratio combining MRC weights and the training of the maximum ratio transmission MRT weights as shown in and Equation 2 as follows. Step 1 norm Step 2 1 norm 2 where

In the first step in Equation 2 the transmitter sends training symbols to the receiver using v i and the receiver estimates the receive beam forming weights that maximize the received signal strength for the transmit vector v i as follows. The receiver measures the response on each effective receive antenna respectively and the measured responses form the vector Hv i . The receive beam forming vector maximizing the received signal e.g. the MRC vector is shown in Equation 3 as follows norm 3 

In the second step in Equation 2 the transmitter sends training symbols through each effective transmit antenna respectively and the receiver estimates the transmit beam forming weights that maximize the received signal strength for the receive vector u i as follows. The receiver uses u i as the receive vector and measures the beam formed channel response for each effective transmit antenna in H respectively. The measured channel responses form the vector u i H. The transmit beam forming vector maximizing the received signal e.g. the MRT vector is shown in Equation 4 as follows 1 norm or 1 norm 4 The value for v i 1 is fed back to the transmitter for the i 1 th iteration. The values for u i and v i gradually converges to the ideal u and v as each iteration completes.

Iterative training is currently used by certain conventional beam forming protocols such as those currently implemented by the WirelessHD Specification. The conventional beam forming protocol utilized by the WirelessHD Specification however introduces a significant amount of training overhead and link latency. It is also designed for training a link in one direction at a time which may be suitable to digital television sets that are designed to operate mainly as receivers and less as transmitters. A PC environment is different however and focus is placed on both transmitting and receiving operations. The enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol reduces link latency for training bidirectional links and is described in further detail with reference to .

In the illustrated embodiments shown in the wireless device exits the idle state and enters the beam forming state . The wireless device may optionally transmit timing acquisition and optimal delay selection sequences to the wireless device . The antenna control module of the wireless device cooperates with the antenna control module of the wireless device to implement an iterative training scheme using an enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol. The iterative training scheme may use any number of iterations as desired for a given implementation.

During a first iterative training the antenna control module uses the transceiver and the phased antenna array of the wireless device to send training signals such as training signals from the wireless device to the wireless device over a downlink DL HRP channel . In a typical scenario multiple training signals are transmitted while the wireless device changes its antenna weights at proper times e.g. at the beginning of every training signal . For example the antenna control module sends receiver Rx training signals from the wireless device to the wireless device over the DL HRP channel to allow the wireless device to deduce the MRC weights and form a directional receive beam pattern for a phased antenna array of the wireless device . The antenna control module sends transmitter Tx training signals from the wireless device to the wireless device over the DL HRP channel to allow the device to measure characteristics of its received signal. These characteristics are later fed back from device to device using message to allow wireless device to deduce its MRT weights so that a directional transmit beam pattern for the phased antenna array of the wireless device can be formed.

In a conventional beam forming protocol the antenna control module may wait to receive feedback information from the wireless device over the LRP channel . In the enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocols however the feedback information from the wireless device is delayed until a directional receive beam pattern for the phased antenna array of the wireless device as been formed or partially formed thereby allowing the wireless device to receive the feedback information from the wireless device over an uplink UL HRP channel . The UL HRP channel operates at a much higher data rate than the LRP channel and therefore using the UL HRP channel for the feedback information reduces training overhead and latency.

Referring again to the message flow the antenna control module uses the transceiver and the phased antenna array of the wireless device to send training signals or sequences to the wireless device over the UL HRP channel . For example the antenna control module sends training signals to the wireless device over the UL HRP channel to deduce the MRC weights and form a directional receive beam pattern for the phased antenna array of the wireless device . The antenna control module also sends training signals to the wireless device over the UL HRP channel to allow the wireless device to measure characteristics of its received signal. These characteristics are later fed back from device to device using message to allow wireless device to deduce its MRT weights so that a directional transmit beam pattern for the phased antenna array of the wireless device can be formed.

Once the phased antenna array of the wireless device has a fully or partially formed directional receive beam pattern using the weights e.g. MRC weights obtained at arrow the wireless device may send feedback information to the wireless device over the UL HRP channel which is received using the directional receive beam pattern for the phased antenna array of the wireless device as indicated by the arrow . The phased antenna array may use the same transmit beam forming vector as used when previously sending the UL PNC Rx vector training PNC MRC weights arrow . This provides the wireless device with receive gain that may not have been available prior to stage or earlier.

The antenna control module may determine AWVs for the directional transmit beam pattern for the phased antenna array of the wireless device using the feedback information from the wireless device . The first iteration may then be completed by having the wireless device send feedback information to the wireless device over the DL HRP channel using a directional transmit beam pattern obtained from recently received feedback information arrow for the phased antenna array of the wireless device . The phased antenna array of the wireless device may use the directional receive beam pattern formed when receiving the DL STA Rx vector training STA MRC weights at arrow to receive the feedback information. The antenna control module may then use the feedback information in determining AWVs for the directional transmit beam pattern for the phased antenna array of the wireless device using the feedback information from the wireless device .

The wireless devices may continue with the next iterative trainings performing similar beam forming or beam refinement operations as used with the first iterative training . For example for iterative training the operations indicated by arrows through are similar to those operations performed as indicated by arrows through . Each iterative training provides successively more accurate AWVs for the HRP channels . This process continues until a terminating condition is reached such as reaching a determined SNR for data communications reaching a determined number of iterations e.g. three iterations or until both ends of the link request termination of the training process. At this point the HRP channels may be used for bidirectional high rate data communications.

It is worthy to note that the feedback information provided at arrow may optionally be moved back and provided during stage . This may add synchronization overhead however because of the transmit receive switching.

In the illustrated embodiments shown in the message flow illustrates a message flow suitable for an enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol implemented for a NGmS network protocol or devices. The NGmS protocol for example may contain DL RX training DL feedback and DL TX training followed by UL RX training UL feedback and UL TX training where the DL feedback is feedback sent over a downlink corresponding to UL TX training that was previously transmitted.

The message flow of is similar to the message flow described with reference to with a different sequencing for the training signals and messages. As shown in the message flow signals and or messages to are reordered in the following sequence and . It may be appreciated that this sequencing provides the following characteristics 1 all arrows in the same direction may be grouped together to form a single packet and 2 in a group there is RX training feedback information and then TX training. Unlike message flow where the feedback information can correspond to current iteration training the message flow corresponds to previous iteration training. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

Similar to the message flow the message flow attempts to coordinate transmit and receive beam forming operations to allow feedback information to be provided over the HRP channels . The wireless device exits the idle state and enters the beam forming state . The wireless device utilizes the message flow to initiate bidirectional beam formation operations using an iterative training scheme to form a pair of communications channels for a WPAN or WVAN. The message flow interleaves transmit and receive beam forming operations to allow use of partially trained links to communicate feedback information at a higher data rate. More particularly the message flow interleaves transmit and receive beam forming operations for the wireless devices to allow feedback information received by the wireless device from the wireless device to be communicated over the HRP channels . This reduces the need to use the LRP channels during beam forming operations.

In the illustrated embodiment shown in the message flow begins with optional timing acquisition and optimal delay selection operations. During a first iterative training the antenna control module sends transmitter Tx training signals from the wireless device to the wireless device over the DL HRP channel to allow the device to measure characteristics of its received signal. The wireless device receives feedback information from the wireless device over the UL LRP to deduce its MRT weights. The antenna control module of the wireless device determines AWVs for the directional transmit beam pattern for the phased antenna array of the wireless device using the feedback information from the wireless device .

The wireless device then sends Rx training signals STA MRC weights to the wireless device over the DL HRP to allow the wireless device to deduce and form a directional receive beam pattern for the phased antenna array of the wireless device as indicated by arrow . The wireless device receives Tx training signals STA MRT weights from the wireless device over the UL HRP to form a directional transmit beam pattern for the phased antenna array of the wireless device as indicated by arrow .

The antenna control module uses the transceiver and the phased antenna array of the wireless device to send training signals from the wireless device to the wireless device over a downlink DL HRP channel to allow the wireless device to deduce the MRC weights and form a directional receive beam pattern for a phased antenna array of the wireless device . The antenna control module also sends training signals to the wireless device over the UL HRP channel to allow the wireless device to measure characteristics of its received signal.

The wireless device sends feedback information to the wireless device over the DL HRP using a directional transmit beam pattern for the phased antenna array of the wireless device . The feedback information is carried using a partially trained link obtained in the recent half iteration. As a result the feedback information is much more robust and efficient than using only the DL LRP channel . The wireless device uses the feedback information to determine AWVs for the directional transmit beam pattern for the phased antenna array of the wireless device using the feedback information from the wireless device .

To complete the first iterative training the wireless device receives training signals by the wireless device from the wireless device over the UL HRP to deduce MRC weights and form a directional receive beam pattern for the phased antenna array of the wireless device .

The wireless devices may continue with the next iterative trainings performing similar beam forming or beam refinement operations as used with the first iterative training . For example the wireless device may receive additional feedback information from the wireless device over the UL HRP using the directional receive beam pattern for the phased antenna array of the wireless device during the second iterative training . The antenna control module may determine AWVs for the directional transmit beam pattern for the phased antenna array of the wireless device using the additional feedback information from the wireless device . Each iterative training provides successively more accurate AWVs for the HRP channels . This process continues until a terminating condition is reached such as reaching a determined SNR for data communications or reaching a determined number of iterations e.g. three iterations . At this point the HRP channels may be used for bidirectional high rate data communications.

The enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol utilizes partially trained links to provide a higher data rate for the feedback information during the feedback stages. In the WirelessHD Specification by way of contrast feedback stages after the first one are done using directional mode which is a selected antenna pattern. With non calibrated antennas a random antenna pattern may yield less than 0 dBi in certain directions. The directional mode is expected to be around 0 dBi as it is the best among few random choices. An additional advantage of the enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol is that the beamformer need not transfer the selected antenna pattern for the directional mode to the beamformee since the next time feedback is already going to be over a beamformed link which is properly trained.

In some embodiments the enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol may train a subset of antenna elements from the phased array antenna . The first few iterations of beam forming operations may be of reduced time and quality. When the phased antenna array is implemented by the wireless device and has 36 antenna elements through then the antenna control module can couple some of the antenna elements through together and generate training for fewer overall antenna elements through . This shortens the time of the training in the first iterative trainings and may still capture some of the expected antenna gain. An example for such coupling is depicted in where four 4 antenna elements and marked in cross hatchings for example are always phase shifted by the same amount such as 90 degrees 180 degrees or 270 degrees. This results in essentially eight 8 to nine 9 antenna elements made from the 6 6 phased antenna array .

By way of example referring again to the exemplary message flows the wireless device may send Tx training signals to the wireless device over the DL HRP to form a directional transmit beam pattern for a subset of antenna elements of the phased antenna array of the wireless device .

Additionally or alternatively the wireless devices may exchange additional information during the enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol that may accelerate beam forming operations. For example similar to the way that the WirelessHD Specification uses to identify the proper antenna pattern index for the directional mode the enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol can add additional information types to certain stages of beam forming operations such a needed modulation and coding scheme MCS for the wireless devices . An information field of defined length e.g. 3 bits may be used to communicate the MCS information. The MCS information may be communicated for example with the transmitter training signals in either link direction in order to assist in generating the feedback information during the feedback stages. Other types of information other than MCS information may be sent during different stages of the enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol and the embodiments are not limited in this context.

In embodiments the feedback information may correspond to measurements done at the receiver and is largely unaware of the antenna patterns applied by the transmitter. An example of feedback information may comprise a channel estimation per given delay among others. In some embodiments the amount of feedback information may be uniform. Additionally or alternatively the wireless devices may exchange increasing amounts of feedback information during the feedback stages of the enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol to accelerate beam forming operations. When the HRP channels are partially or fully formed and the feedback overhead becomes cheaper then one or both of the wireless devices can increase the amount of feedback information provided over the HRP channels at certain stages and or iterative trainings so that the overall beam forming training time is reduced.
