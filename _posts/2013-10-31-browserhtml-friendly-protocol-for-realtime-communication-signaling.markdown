The present invention relates to a system and method for communicating in a web only internet and telecommunication network including extending telecommunications networks to the Web environment. In particular the present invention relates to a protocol for real time communication signaling between an HTML environment and the IMS core of a telecommunications network.

With the explosive proliferation of IP enabled mobile and fixed devices capable of offering Web telecom and entertainment services such as 3G 4G enabled smart phones TVs home appliances gaming consoles and automobiles among others operators of mobile broadband and fixed networks are faced with the operational and business challenges of delivering innovative IP based communication services with maximum profitability. In order to achieve this goal customers are increasingly migrating away from expensive closed proprietary and application specific legacy platforms and towards low cost open standards based unified converged application platforms which dramatically lower the time and cost of adding new features and extensions to existing IP based communication services.

Session Initiation Protocol SIP is a control signaling protocol developed to manage interactive multimedia IP sessions including IP telephony presence and instant messaging. SIP is widely used in telecommunication networks. SIP and other communications centric protocols are complex and their implementation requires significant domain expertise. However SIP is not readily compatible with HTTP and use in the Internet domain.

The IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS is an architecture for an integrated network of telecommunications carriers that would facilitate the use of IP Internet Protocol for packet communications in all known forms over wireless or landline. Examples of such packet communications include traditional telephony fax e mail Voice over IP VoIP instant messaging IM videoconference sessions and video on demand VoD . IMS uses a Voice over IP VoIP and runs over the standard Internet Protocol IP . IMS gives network operators and service providers the ability to control and charge for each service. IMS architecture has the capability to support existing phone systems both packet switched and circuit switched . Thus IMS provides the interoperability security session management and QoS capabilities that telecommunications providers lack and desire. IMS is the de facto standard for next generation networks.

HyperText Markup Language HTML is the main markup language for creating web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser. HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags. HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. HTML allows images and objects to be embedded and can be used to create interactive forms. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings paragraphs lists links quotes and other items. It can embed scripts written in languages such as JavaScript which affect the behavior of HTML web pages. The purpose of a web browser is to read HTML documents and compose them into visible or audible web pages. The HTML environment has a well known behavior according to standards established by the World Wide Web Consortium W3C is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web abbreviated WWW or W3 .

HTML5 introduced WebRTC application programming interfaces APIs that make it possible for applications that use JavaScript in an HTML5 environment to take part in real time communications. To make use of this capability applications that reside in the browser environment of one user need to exchange messages with another application to establish media connections. However the signaling process of exchanging and negotiating session information is not specified by W3C and is left to the application to implement. The problem is more complicated if it is desired to make a connection with a non browser media endpoint like a traditional telephony equipment.

It would be desirable to provide access to the network services available in the IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS from the HTML environment and in particular the HTML environments capable of real time communication for example HTML5. However extending IMS architecture to the HTML environment is difficult owing to incompatibility of SIP with HTTP over TCP IP and the requirement for domain expertise to overcome such incompatibility. There is presently no simple way to extend the network services of the IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS to HTML5 applications without radical changes to the IMS model and custom extensions to the HTML platform to permit a browser to be used as an endpoint for IMS services. Thus despite the desire to extend the enhanced capabilities that IMS provides to the HTML environment such integration has not been readily feasible.

It would therefore be desirable to provide a system and method for extending IMS architecture to the HTML environment which is effective and simple to implement.

It would further be desirable to provide a system and method for extending IMS architecture to the HTML environment without radical changes to the IMS model or custom extensions to the HTML platform.

It would further be desirable to provide a system and method for extending IMS architecture to the HTML environment which can be implemented without domain expertise.

The present invention provides a protocol component of system and method for extending IMS architecture to the HTML environment which overcomes the limitations of the state of the art.

The present invention provides a protocol component of a system and method for extending IMS architecture to the HTML environment which can be implemented without domain expertise.

In an embodiment the protocol component of the present invention provides a protocol for use in a communication channel between an HTML capable application or operating system and the IMS core of a telecommunications network. The protocol helps overcome the need for domain expertise of complex SIP and other communications centric protocols. The protocol is part of a mechanism to combine complex signaling in the IMS telecommunications network into simple operations towards the Web. The protocol of the present invention thereby contributes to a platform which enables telecommunications providers to provide a better end to end customer experience accessible from a wide variety of HTML capable consumer devices.

In an embodiment the protocol of the present invention is used for communicating between a client side controller and a network side controller. The client side controller provides client side native operating system application programming interfaces API and JavaScript APIs to interface with the HTML capable application or operating system and encapsulate the HTTP signaling layer. The network side controller terminates the communications with the client side and parses and normalizes the communications into an internal protocol suitable for communication with IMS within legacy telecommunications network systems for example XMPP SIP and the like . The communications protocol provides a communication channel which is compatible with transmission over the Internet domain. The protocol thus facilitates creation of a dedicated signaling channel for all the applications on the client to interact with the IMS of telecommunications network services.

In a particular embodiment the protocol of the present invention provides part of a system and method for exchanging signaling messages between HTML5 applications and a network side controller for example Oracle WebRTC Session Controller WSC . The protocol is based in part on JavaScript Object Notation JSON and thus leverages JSON objects commonly used by HTML5 applications to specify a message format data exchange protocol and reliability protocol. The protocol utilizes WebSocket and the protocol can be used on multiple transports COMET BOSH and WebSocket . The JSON based protocol which can be called a JSONrtc protocol can be used by a network side controller to mediate real time communications between HTML5 applications and non HTML5 endpoints. The protocol and message format is friendly for conversion to other protocols used by non HTML5 environments thus enabling the signaling sever to mediate between an HTML5 application and a non HTML5 endpoint e.g. traditional telephony equipment.

Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the various embodiments when read in light of the accompanying drawings.

Furthermore in certain instances numerous specific details will be set forth to provide a thorough description of the invention. However it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known features have not been described in as much detail so as not to obscure the invention.

The first digit in a three digit reference numeral indicates the series of figures in which the element first appears.

The protocol of the present invention provides part of a system and method for transmitting signaling messages to and from HTML5 applications. The protocol utilizes JavaScript Object Notation JSON and thus leverages JSON objects commonly used by HTML5 applications to specify a message format data exchange protocol and reliability protocol. The protocol also utilizes WebSocket and the protocol can be used on multiple transports COMET BOSH and WebSocket . The JSON based protocol can be used by a network side controller to mediate between HTML5 applications and non HTML5 endpoints. The protocol and message format is friendly for conversion to other protocols used by non HTML5 environments thus enabling the signaling sever to mediate between an HTML5 application and a non HTML5 endpoint e.g. traditional telephony equipment.

JavaScript Object Notation JSON is a text based open standard designed for human readable data interchange. It is derived from the JavaScript scripting language for representing simple data structures and associative arrays called objects. The JSON format is described in RFC 4627. The JSON format can be used for serializing and transmitting structured data over a network connection e.g. between a server and web application. The protocol of the present invention thus facilitates the integration of protocol functionality in Web applications by making use of JSON. Additionally the protocol is designed to facilitate translation into other protocols such as SIP. Accordingly Web developers can access telecom functionality from a Web application without having expertise in telecommunications protocols such as SIP. The protocol can also be used between HTML5 endpoints.

In an embodiment of the present invention the communications protocol is used for communicating between a client side controller and network side controller . The client side controller provides a client side JavaScript API to interface with the HTML capable application or operating system e.g. Browser and encapsulates the HTTP signaling layer. The network side controller terminates the communications with the client side over protocol and parses and normalizes the communications into an internal protocol suitable for communication with IMS within legacy telecommunications network systems for example XMPP SIP and the like . The communications protocol provides a communication channel which is compatible with transmission over the Internet domain . The protocol thus facilitates creation of a dedicated signaling channel for all the applications on the user equipment to interact with the IMS Core of telecommunications network services.

In an embodiment of the invention the protocol is also applicable to pure web applications. For example the protocol is suited for communicating in a browser webapplication browser scenario. In this case a webserver e.g. Apache can implement the protocol so that the browser applications can use it.

An embodiment of the invention exposes a protocol that makes use of JavaScript Object Notation JSON objects that are commonly used by HTML5 applications. The protocol specifies a message format data exchange protocol and reliability protocol which are expressed using such JSON objects. The protocol makes use of features of WebSocket protocol and can be defined as a WebSocket subprotocol. In an alternative embodiment the protocol can be defined as a WebSocket extension to leverage the extension properties of WebSocket e.g. the opcodes extension data reserved bits etc. however this would require cooperation by W3C and IETF working groups .

The protocol provides for messages to be sent back and forth between the HTML5 application and the network side controller over a WebSocket connection. It is expected that authentication would happen at the time of establishment of the WebSocket connection using a prominent Web authentication scheme. A web identity established by such a procedure will be mapped by the gateway or server with the network backend in an appropriate way unrelated to protocol . The network side controller can use these messages for exchanging the media information between the HTML5 application instances and non HTML endpoints in IMS CORE . The protocol and message format is readily convertible to other protocols such as internal protocol used by non HTML5 environments. One such protocol is Session Initiation Protocol SIP which can be used to connect traditional telephony equipment endpoints in IMS Core . The protocol has the following advantages 1. It enables connectivity with non HTML5 endpoints 2. It enables signaling between HTML5 endpoints and 3. Since the protocol is based on JSON it is very easy to integrate with HTML5 applications.

User equipment represents any HTML capable device including for example computing devices such as personal computers laptops desktops notebooks netbooks tablets mobile phones and e book readers. Moreover HTML capabilities are being added to consumer devices such as appliances automobiles set top boxes amplifiers audio visual components televisions projectors and the like. HTML capabilities may be provided by a browser for example Safari Firefox Chrome Browser Internet Explorer. Alternatively HTML capabilities may be a core component of the operating system for example Chrome OS.

IMS Core IP Multimedia Subsystem or IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem is an architectural framework for delivering IP multimedia services. As shown in IMS Core comprises S CSCF P CSCF MGCF HSS Application Server and Media Server . These elements are shown as an example of conventional IMS architecture. IMS Core may contain additional and or different elements depending upon the implementation of a particular network. The present invention is not limited to any particular implementation of IMS Core . Indeed it is a feature of the present invention that it extends whatever features are present in IMS Core to the Internet domain.

To ease the integration with the Internet IMS uses IETF protocols wherever possible e.g. Session Initiation Protocol SIP . IMS Core include network elements designed to interact with SIP User Agents and PSTN . As used herein a user agent is an SIP endpoint that can be considered anything that either originates or terminates a SIP session e.g. SIP Phones Soft Phones and the like. Typically such devices must be specifically designed to implement SIP in order to function as SIP User Agents . In addition the IMS Core can exchange signaling and media messages with a public switched telephone network PSTN . IMS Core facilitates access to multimedia and voice applications from wireless and wireline terminals to create a form of fixed mobile convergence FMC . This is done by having a horizontal control layer that isolates the access network from the service layer. From a logical architecture perspective services need not have their own control functions as the control layer is a common horizontal layer.

Referring again to the IMS Core shown in P CSCF represents the proxy call session control function which is an entry point for a SIP user agent and authenticates users and establishes IP security integration with the SIP user agent . Media gateway controller function MGCF is the entry point for signaling and media messages transmitted via public switched telephone network PSTN . MGCF and P CSCF are used to process ingoing and outgoing SIP signaling packets in the IMS Core . On the network side MGCF and P CSCF interact with S CSCF using Session Initiation Protocol SIP .

S CSCF is the central node of the signaling plane. It is a SIP server but also performs session control. S CSCF is located in the home network. It uses Diameter Cx and Dx interfaces to the Home Subscriber Server HSS to download user profiles and upload user to S CSCF associations. All necessary subscriber profile information is loaded from the HSS . S CSCF inspects every message from the SIP user agent and or other network elements and decides where the SIP message should be forwarded for service provision. An Application Server AS hosts and executes services and interfaces with the S CSCF using SIP. Additionally a media server provides media related functions such as media manipulation e.g. voice stream mixing and interfaces with the S CSCF using SIP. S CSCF may also allow for provisioning of services and or media services from an external server .

As described above the elements of IMS Core communicate with the central node of the signaling plane S CSCF using Session Initiation Protocol SIP alternative session oriented protocols may also be used including for example XMPP . However SIP is not easily compatible with conventional protocols for transmission over the Web . Integration of IMS Core is therefore difficult owing to incompatibility of protocols used in the two different environments and the requirement for domain expertise to overcome such incompatibility. The present invention provides a solution to such problems and therefore allows for extending the IMS Core to the Web .

Network side controller is an entry point for HTTP traffic from Web . Network side controller terminates Internet domain communications with the client side and parses and normalizes the Internet domain communications into an internal protocol suitable for communicating with elements of the IMS Core e.g. S CSCF within legacy telecommunications network systems for example XMPP SIP and the like . Network side controller communicates with client side controller using a protocol adapted to meet the real time signally requirements of SIP while remaining compatible with transmission over Web . The client side controller operating on User equipment provides a client side JavaScript API to interface with HTML capable applications operating systems and encapsulate the HTTP signaling layer. The system and method thereby provides a dedicated signaling channel for all the HTML capable applications OS on the User Equipment to interact with the IMS Core of the telecommunications network.

From an IMS network perspective network side controller sits in the edge of IMS core and is architecturally parallel to a P CSCF. While P CSCF is the entry point many times along with a Session Border Controller for the SIP endpoints network side controller serves as the entry point for HTML5 endpoints. Thus network side controller has the ability to leverage applications in the IMS application server instead of hosting a separate custom business application on its own thus greatly simplifying integration with IMS Core . For example for a conference server the network side controller would intelligently hand the requests to a backend IMS application server . The conference application would then route the requests to an appropriate media mixer and run the conference.

In a particular embodiment described in more detail with respect to the protocol of the present invention provides part of a system and method for exchanging signaling messages between HTML5 applications e.g. Browser and a network side controller for example Oracle WebTRC Session Controller WSC . The protocol can also be used for communications between HTML5 endpoints. The protocol comprises JavaScript Object Notation JSON format messages and thus leverages JSON objects commonly used by HTML5 applications e.g. Browser to specify a message format data exchange protocol and reliability protocol. The protocol utilizes WebSocket and the protocol can be used on multiple transports COMET BOSH and WebSocket . The JSON format protocol can be used by a network side controller to mediate between HTML5 applications e.g. Browser and non HTML5 endpoints e.g. IMS Core . The protocol facilitates communication of media offers and answers to enable WebRTC and can be referred to as a JSONrtc protocol. The protocol and message format are also friendly for conversion to other protocols e.g. internal protocol used by non HTML5 environments e.g. IMS Core thus enabling the network side controller to mediate between an HTML5 application and a non HTML5 endpoint e.g. traditional telephony equipment.

Protocol defines a data exchange format for communication between and HTML5 Application and a server or other HTML5 endpoints. At a top level data format defines a set of control headers a set of general headers and a payload. The control headers primarily relate to operation of the communication channel whereas the general headers relate to the communication. In communication with a network side controller the control headers are primarily useful to actions of the networks side controller itself whereas the general headers are useful for conversion to a downstream protocol e.g. SIP. The two layers of headers thereby simplify communication with the network side controller as well as simplifying implementation by a web developer.

As illustrated in a frame or message in the protocol can contain a headers section and a payload section . The headers section includes a control headers section and a general headers section .

The payload section is specific to the package being used. A package is the type of service or functionality that the message handles. The defined packages for this protocol are call presence and message notification. For example the payload for the call package will be an SDP offer or answer and the payload for the message notification package can be a JSON data with exact message alerts. Similarly a presence package would expect the payload to be the presence information.

The control headers section contains the information related to the semantics of the protocol e.g. information required for WebSocket re connect reliability timeouts error etc. It also contains the state of the message type of the message etc. In an embodiment of the invention the control headers section can include the following fields control type session Id sequence number acknowledge sequence message state a package type a subsession Id version and correlation id . The fields comprise attribute value pairs information related to the semantics of the protocol. TABLE I shows the control headers of the protocol.

The control type defines the types of the message which can be request response message acknowledgement or error. A request control type indicates that the message requires a response and a response control type indicates the message is a response to a request. In an embodiment of the invention the control types of request response and message can include a payload .

Requests responses and messages can carry a payload between the client and a server. An advantage of messages is that they do not necessitate a response. The protocol has its own reliability model to ensure message delivery as explained below. Thus messages can be used to avoid request response overhead. This simplifies coding of the communication for the Web developer as the developer does not need to code the request response functionality but can instead rely on the reliability model to ensure message delivery.

In an embodiment of the invention a message state field specifies if a message is Initial Subsequent or Final. For example an answer can be an initial answer subsequent answer or a final answer. The state of Initial is implied for any message and the state for a subsequent or final message needs to be explicitly specified.

Package type indicates the type of service or functionality that the message handles e.g. call and presence. If no package type is specified a call package is assumed for all messages except messages with a CONNECT action.

The protocol provides for both a Session ID and a Subsession ID. Session ID identifies a WebSocket session that the client establishes with the server. The Session ID is unique across time and space. This helps Session ID to remain unique across geographically redundant clusters and also withstand node geography failures. A subsession ID can be used to identify a particular subsession within a WebSocket session. In an embodiment of the invention the Subsession ID is the sequence number of the message that establishes the subsession with a prefix c or s denoting the direction of the referenced message where c indicates that the referenced message is originated from the client and s indicates that the referenced message is originated from the server network side controller .

The protocol provides for a unique sequence number for each message of a session WebSocket connection . The sequence number is a serial message number that starts with 1 at the beginning of the session and increments with each message. Each side of the WebSocket connection has their own series of sequence numbers. A sequence number uniquely identifies each message within a session. An acknowledge sequence number acknowledges receipt of all messages up to and including the specified sequence number within the session. This header can appear in both client and sever messages.

Correlation ID can be used to associate a message with a prior message. For example a correlation ID can associate a response message with the related request message. The sequence numbers provide a protocol reliability model. The correlation id is a number prefixed with c or s denoting the direction of the referenced message c indicating that the reference message originated from the client and s indicating that the reference message originated from the server.

The sequence number along with acknowledgement sequence numbers error messages and retransmission ensure that messages are reliably exchanged between HTML5 applications and the network side controller or HTML5 endpoints . The acknowledgement messages and error messages are applicable to requests responses and messages. An acknowledgement message can be identified by the message acknowledgement control type in the control headers section. It is an acknowledgement that a message and all the messages with a lower sequence number have been successfully delivered. In an embodiment of the invention the protocol allows an HTML5 application to be configured to send an acknowledgement message for every message. If one side receives an acknowledgement message with a sequence number higher than that of a particular sent message and does not receive an error message for the particular message it can be assumed that the particular message has been successfully delivered. In an embodiment of the invention an error message indicates that a message with the specified sequence number has encountered an error.

The protocol utilizes a WebSocket connection and retransmissions of messages are not required except when the connections are broken and need to be re synched. The connection recovery can follow the semantics explained in the MBWS specification. The protocol also depends on the WebSocket ping pong to support keepalive and the failure of one side to receive the keepalive would result in timeout of the last request response message. In a scenario where the WebSocket ping pong is not supported by the browser the client side controller can initiate a custom ping pong with the network side controller. When the browser client side controller determines that it is not receiving pong from the server any more it continues to send the ping messages for a stipulated period of time at intervals which double at each attempt.

The general headers section contains information related to the specific action involved in the message. For example for a START request the general headers section can identify who has initiated the request for whom the request is intended etc. In an embodiment of the invention the general headers include the following fields action an initiator a target error code and message notification header . The fields comprise attribute value pairs information related to the semantics of the protocol. An HTML5 application can also add additional headers to this section in the form of additional AVPs attribute value pairs . Such additional AVPs may be mapped by a gateway server e.g. network side controller WSE to a SIP header or a parameter. TABLE II shows the general headers of the protocol.

The action field indicates an action which the message is used for. For example the action CONNECT establishes a protocol level session with the server the action START indicates that the message is used for starting a session with a particular package. The optional initiator indicates the user e.g. alice example.com who initiated a request. In an embodiment of the invention while the client can set this value this value may come from the HTTP session. In certain cases such a value may not even exist. For example when a random user clicks on the web page to talk with a customer service representative. The optional target field can be used to indicate a remote peer. The optional error code field can be used to transmit an error code.

A client requests a connection reconnect by sending a Connect frame containing the session id of the connection to be reconnected followed by a list of three message sequence numbers. The first sequence number CSLR is that of the last message the client has received. The second CSLW and third CSUW sequence numbers define the respective lower and upper bounds of the sequence numbers of the messages in the client s retained message window. Upon receipt of this Connect frame the server determines if it can reconnect based on the following criteria The session id must match the client s current session id CSLR 1 must be the sequence number of a message the server can reinitiate sending with i.e. either the message with this sequence number is in the connection s retained message window or it is the sequence number of the next unsent message and the message sequence number of the message the server last received SSLR is in the range of CSLW 1 to CSUW. If all three criteria are met the reconnect succeeds and the server responds with a Connect frame containing the reconnected session id and one sequence number SSLR which is that of the last message received by the server. Message transport then resumes with the client sending the SSLR 1 message and the server sending the CSLR 1 message. If the criteria are not met the reconnect request fails and the server treats it as though it were a connect request and responds with a connect response. The client recognizes that its reconnect request has been converted into a connect request because the response contains a session id that does not match the session id in the client s reconnect request.

In an embodiment of the invention the general headers section can include more optional fields such as action specific fields and package specific fields. An example of an action specific field can be a field used when a CONNECT message is sent with an existing session ID to re establish the session. The value of this field can be the sequence number of the last received message at the client. An example of the package specific headers can be a header that represents expiry time of the subscription for message summary notifications.

The network side controller WSE can provide the ability to extend the protocol by adding depth and applicability to a set of existing methods. New headers e.g. security header and capabilities header can be added to the control headers section and the general headers section of a message. New control types and message types can also be added e.g. UPDATE and the protocol extensions shall follow the semantics of the core protocol control and general headers .

In order to facilitate extensibility JSON templates can be provided to facilitate the protocol extension. For example JSON templates can allow a client to program towards abstract data and service models rather than directly to JSON specified structure definitions. In an embodiment of the invention templates can be provided for message types CONNECT START NOTIFY and create a new message type by providing a message name and the required header parameters in the templates. The template can create a new message type based on the parameters passed. The templates may be provided for example by the network side controller WSE.

As shown in initially a WebSocket connection is established between Browser Client side Controller and Network side Controller . The client browser is authenticated using typical authentication mechanisms and a handshake mechanism is used to establish the WebSocket connection with the Network side Controller . It is expected that authentication would happen at the time of establishment of the WebSocket connection using a prominent Web authentication scheme. A web identity established by such a procedure will be mapped by the gateway or server with the network backend in an appropriate way unrelated to protocol . As an option it is possible to direct the client side controller to an authentication endpoint by sending an appropriate response to a connection request.

At step Browser sends a Connect request to Network side Controller using JSONrtc protocol. The Network side Controller maps the CONNECT message to SIP REGISTER and transmits the Register request to S CSCF using SIP at step . Network side Controller then waits for the response from S CSCF . S CSCF is a standard SIP element that can forward the SIP REGISTER to one or more SIP endpoints within IMS Core e.g. a traditional telephony equipment. After forwarding the SIP REGISTER to the desired endpoint and receiving a response at step S CSCF sends an OK response to Network side Controller . At step Network side Controller maps the SIP OK message to a JSONrtc response to the CONNECT message and transmits the response to Browser .

After receiving the CONNECT response Browser sends a START message to Network side Controller using JSONrtc. The Network side Controller maps the START message to SIP INVITE and transmits the INVITE request to S CSCF using SIP at step . Network side Controller then waits for the response from S CSCF . After forwarding the INVITE request to the desired endpoint S CSCF waits for a response. While waiting S CSCF sends provisional SIP responses at steps and . 100 TRYING indicates an extended search is being performed. 180 TRYING indicates that the destination endpoint has received the INVITE. At step Network side Controller sends an initial response message to Browser . At step having received an affirmative response to the INVITE request from the SIP endpoint S CSCF sends a 200 OK response to Network side Controller . At step Network side Controller maps the SIP OK message to a JSONrtc final response to the START message and transmits the final response message to Browser . At step Browser sends a COMPLETE message to Network side Controller using JSONrtc to indicate completion of the media establishment.

At step upon receiving the COMPLETE message Network side Controller sends an ACK message to S CSCF using SIP. At step SIP Endpoint transmits a BYE request to S CSCF using SIP. The BYE request from the SIP endpoint to the Network side Controller would result in sending a SHUTDOWN action from the Network side Controller to the Browser at step . At step Network side Controller also sends a SIP OK response to S CSCF for transmission to the SIP endpoint. In an embodiment of the invention a SHUTDOWN request can be initiated by the Browser to Network side Controller at step . At step Network side Controller would send a BYE to S CSCF which then would respond with a 200 OK at step . Upon receiving the response from S CSCF Network side Controller would send an ACK to the Browser at step .

The following examples illustrate how the protocol of the present invention may be utilized to perform certain functions.

Further details of one possible implementation of the system and method of the present invention will now be described with respect to in which Network side controller is implemented as Oracle WebRTC Session Controller WSC Client side controller is implemented as RTC Client Signaling Controller and protocol is implemented in JavaScript Object Notation JSON over WebSocket.

RTC Controller provides scalable signaling over HTTP web centric protocols for communicating over Web with RTC Client Signaling Controller . RTC Controller communicates with RTC Client Signaling Controller via web sockets interface . RTC Controller provides a highly available encapsulated front end interface to the web developer. The RTC Controller terminates the Internet domain communications with the client side by managing the web socket connections. The RTC Controller also parses and processes the Internet domain communications. The RTC Controller normalizes the Internet domain communications into an internal SIP for communication within Gateway . Thus RTC Controller communicates internally with Service Composition Controller using a binary SIP.

Service Composition Controller provides for service composition and orchestration across domains and different providers. The Service Composition Controller also provides a unified layer to inject charging and policy control for differentiated service offerings. In an embodiment the functionality of Service Composition Controller can be integrated in to a converged application server for example Oracle Communications Converged Application Server OCCAS . Alternatively the functionality of Service Composition Controller can be integrated in to a service controller for example Oracle Communications Service Controller OCSC .

Service Composition Controller adopts and reuses existing internal communication services with support for different signaling protocols. Thus for example Service Composition Controller can mediate Internal Services providing network telephony signaling using the SS7 protocol and Internal Services providing services using internet protocol .

Service Composition Controller can also mediate the provision of external services provided by an external service provider . Communication with external provider can be conducted using a selected signaling protocol SIP XMPP etc as required by the external provider . Services provided by external provider can include web services provided over Web to a browser client on user equipment . Service Composition Controller thus enables external providers of over the top OTT services to provide OTT services to users clients. The gateway system enables the external providers to make use of the real time communication signaling over IMS. The users clients can then access web applications provided by external providers from a browser on the user equipment.

The gateway system acts as the IMS proxy for both HTML5 and external providers by taking advantage of WebSocket technology to enable and expedite the IMS deployment. The WebSocket Protocol defines a mechanism for fast secure two way communication between a client and a server over the Web. Data is transferred over a full duplex single socket connection allowing messages to be sent and received from both endpoints in real time. To establish a WebSocket connection a specific HTTP based handshake is exchanged between the client and the server. If successful the application layer protocol is upgraded from HTTP to WebSocket using the previously established TCP transport layer connection. After the handshake HTTP is no longer used and data can be sent or received using the WebSocket protocol by both endpoints until the WebSocket connection is closed.

RTC Client Signaling Controller is resident on user equipment and manages multiplexing of signaling request response for all client side applications mediating communication with RTC Controller over HTTP web centric protocols. The particular HTTP protocol used can be defined as required by the particular native or external service for example JSON XML XMPP Skype protocol etc. A client side library of available protocols is provided as part of an SDK in order to extend the services to the client.

For telephony applications low power consumption by user equipment is desirable. Accordingly RTC Client Signaling Controller can be placed in standby operation when not involved in signaling. Moreover web socket protocol must be initiated from the client side and is also responsible for keeping the connection alive. Thus the RTC Client Signaling Controller will shut down the web socket connections when there is no traffic. RTC Push Notification Controller can be used by RTC Controller to wake up RTC Client Signaling Controller from the standby state in order to resume communication. The RTC Push Notification Controller may in some embodiments also be used for other notifications such as call notifications message notifications and the like. In an alternative embodiment as described above the keepalive and pingpong capabilities of the WebSocket protocol may be used to maintain WebSocket connection.

RTC Push Notification Controller includes a server side HTTP connection based Push Notification to wake up the client side signaling process. RTC Client Signaling Controller can utilize any push notification mechanism and protocol effective for user equipment . For example RTC Push Notification Controller can utilize the SMS message system to activate RTC Client Signaling Controller thereby causing RTC Client Signaling Controller to reactivate the web sockets connection with the RTC Controller .

WSC including WSE runtime module supports multiple signaling protocols and ensures correct mapping of the signaling message using parameter transformation module and correct routing of the messages based on routing profiles using routing manager . Parameter transformation routing and JSON templating are all configurable using a configuration file .

WSC performs protocol mapping between the selected client side protocol and the network side protocol SIP . For example WSC is adapted to receive a JSON message parse the SDP information and map it to other supported protocols SIP XMPP . WSC maintains a data definition for the format to parse to. When the JSON request is received at WSC the transformation between the data definition and the JSON message structure must be implemented.

WSC acts as a cross protocol signaling engine. WSC handles the protocol associated state as demanded by the protocol. When WSC is acting as a cross protocol gateway for example JSON WebSocket to SIP the SIP side of WSC maintains the transaction and dialog state. WSC includes a protocol state management module which manages the protocol state and ensures state replication for reliability of message exchange. WSC has the ability to manage enormous amounts of concurrent client connections in order to be able to scale to the applications and users on the web.

For developers the key is to leverage existing knowledge and skill sets to minimize additional time and resources required by security features implementation. WSC comes with APIs that support multiple platforms running under multiple protocols and a set of client libraries to facilitate smooth development process. WSC thus additionally provides an extensibility framework to extend the capabilities via protocol adaptors and APIs for the web developers to call the WSE functions from their applications.

WSC provides signaling adaption such that WSC handles all the signaling between the browser client and the network end point SIP Proxy PSTN Gateway for example . WSC is adapted to handle the message exchange using several protocols over WebSocket RFC 6455 including for example JSON based protocol via JSON Stack XMPP sub protocol via XMPP Stack SIP sub via SIP Stack BOSH XEP 0124 and COMET Bayeux protocol not shown . On the network carrier side the web signaling engine supports translation into a suitable communication protocol or protocols e.g. XMPP SIP and the like . Thus for example on the network carrier side WSC supports SIP RFC 3261 .

Security for real time communication over the Web requires that the communicating endpoints be able to authenticate each other. While these end points are making calls through the signaling services their identities are authenticated via an Identity Provider Management Module IDP that supports OAuth Facebook Connect FBC and other Identity Protocols using extensions e.g. OpenID connect . IDP Management modules interact with internal and or external user database and identity servers .

WSC thereby acts as an identity service that can attest the identity of the caller of the received request and map it to the from identity of the outbound call. For example WSC includes OAUTH module which introduces security functions that authenticate and authorize the browser based applications to interact with the network services. WSC thereby provides service providers with the ability to control any third party partner s access and usage of its network capabilities.

Establishing real time communication over the Web also utilizes verification of service level agreements SLA for the user and application. SLA Management module includes an authentication module as well as an application SLA module and network SLA module which communicate with internal and or external databases to verify that the communications are provided in conformance with the relevant service level agreements for the user and application.

In a particular embodiment WSC defines a JavaScript Object Notation JSON protocol that is used for exchanging information and to control the set up of media between a browser client and WSC . JSON is a lightweight data interchange format however other data interchange formats may be used in alternative embodiments. The JSON protocol can be used on multiple transports COMET BOSH and WebSocket . When used on WebSocket transport the protocol is defined as a sub protocol of the WebSocket protocol.

The JSON protocol or alternative data interchange format defines the basic structure for the information transfer between the browser client and WSC . The JSON protocol defines the minimum set of messages and state machinery necessary to implement the offer answer model. The JSON protocol defines the message structure that accounts for the reliability reconnect retransmissions timeouts etc of the message. The JSON protocol also handles the necessary headers to function in multilevel secure environment security headers .

WSC also provides an internal routing manager for the routing of the requests to the appropriate end nodes based on variety of parameters. There are multiple WSE instances see and each instance is connected to the network node serving the functionality. The incoming requests JSON messages for example have to be routed to the right application and instance. WSC uses routing manger to route incoming requests based on their origination and destination. WSC provides functionality including performing look ups and route requests for JSON to SIP JSON to XMPP SIP to XMPP XMPP to SIP. Each route in the WSE routing manager has a routing profile. WSC provides a default routing profile and additional routing profiles are configurable as needed or desired.

WSC ensures reconnection of clients due to failover or loss of connectivity. Clients and servers use an implicit sequence numbering protocol for the message transported by the connection. Clients and the servers each maintain their own sequence number. Both client and server acknowledge their receipt of messages by sending acknowledgement ack messages. As per the protocol an ack message indicates that the message has reached the destination as well as all the messages lower than that sequence . Similarly an error message shall be defined as in the JSON protocol section to indicate that the message with a sequence number has met with an error. Retransmission Queue A B allows for retransmission of messages for which there is an error or lack of acknowledgement.

One way in which WSC maintains reliability is to keep the relevant conversation state redundant across different servers A B having instances of WSC . WSC provides for state maintenance and session state mapping across protocols. The relevant conversation state includes a Web Side State Machine and SIP Side State Machine for each In Flight Transaction . WSC maintains the session states both client and server side state in the cache. In order to ensure reliability the cached copy of the state machines is duplicated on several servers. Additionally retransmission queue A B is duplicated across servers A B. WSC uses coherence for state storage and management. If a server for example server A cannot be contacted due to a network failure WSC ensures that the state is retrieved from another active server B as shown by the dashed arrows .

In an embodiment application is a JavaScript Application. Application operates at a high level without having to deal with peer connection directly. The browser client is stateless and contains as little of the implementation of the transport establishment code as possible. Browser client identifies the capabilities of the browser client and user equipment for streaming media. The capabilities are provided to the SDP adapter of the application . SDP adapter provides a description of streaming media initialization parameters a session profile suitable for streaming media to the browser client running on user equipment .

A client side library of available protocols is provided as part of a Client SDK in order to extend the services to the browser client . The particular HTTP protocol used can be defined as required by the particular native or external service for example JSON XML XMPP Skype protocol etc. In a preferred embodiment a JSON protocol is used for communication between client side RTC signaling controller and WSC as described above.

Protocol serialization interacts with protocol state view and connection manger to communicate with WSC over Web . Session Control establishes reliable connection with WSC . This session can be used by the application to create or invoke other objects.

RTC signaling controller comprises a JavaScript SDK which provides the functions necessary for application to manage server connections connection establishment teardown via web socket . The JavaScript SDK provides functions necessary to handle the state machine and functions to deal with interoperability issues. For example the JavaScript SDK of application provides functions to create messages or insert messages into the state machine. The JavaScript SDK also provides functions for the client to monitor connection health including the ability to reconnect in case of stale connections and the ability to synchronize state from the server and add modified state back to the server.

JavaScript SDK also provides an application programming interface API which can modify and optimize media parameters session description protocol SDP etc. The API abstracts out complex functionality and provides API to deal with the real time communication session Call etc. The API provides the ability to handle call states media states subscriptions and notifications.

In operation HTML5 applications access the JavaScript APIs to get access to various communication objects as defined in the API . An HTML5 application will create a session object . The session object acts as browser side representation of the communication. From session object application can create different communication objects like Call Subscription etc. The HTML5 application can listen on the callbacks from the objects to receive incoming calls notifications media in the call state changes etc.

The Interactive Connectivity Establishment ICE draft developed by the IETF s MMUSIC working group provides a framework to unify the various NAT traversal techniques. ICE defines a standardized method for clients to determine what type of firewall s exist between clients and determine a set of IP addresses by which clients can establish contact. When an ICE enabled client the initiator wishes to communicate with another device the responder it first collects information on addresses where the client can receive IP traffic. A key benefit that ICE provides is the ability to unify the information provided by these various sources of IP address information to create as many paths as possible by which the endpoints can be reached.

For real time communication over the Web the ICE state machine is maintained by the browser client . When the browser client reloads the application has no knowledge of the ICE Candidates and is forced to perform ICE restart. In order to avoid this application can save this information in WSC . When the initial ICE negotiation finishes the browser client sends the nominated ICE candidate pair of IP addresses to the application which saves this information in WSC . When the browser client reloads the application will fetch the nominated ICE candidate information from the server and then send it to the browser client . This will tell the browser client to use these candidates for media transfer. Since the browser client has kept the local nominated ICE candidate alive all the time as long as the remote side has not released the call the transfer will succeed.
