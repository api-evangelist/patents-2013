This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 114 825 filed May 5 2008 and titled SCENE GRANULAR GEOGRAPHICAL BASED VIDEO FOOTAGE VISUALIZATONS the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.

Finding a particular digital video clip saved in mass storage and loaded in memory containing multiple video files is difficult. The difficulty is made worse by multiple video clips that are often captured in a single video file. To find a particular video clip a user may have to open multiple video files and view all or a portion of each video to find a particular clip. Such an approach is time consuming and may cause the user to give up the search for the desired video clip before it is found. As a result productivity may decrease and the overall user experience may be frustrating.

Systems methods and computing devices are provided for viewing scene granular video based on geographical location. The computing device may include a memory configured to store video and geographical coordinates at which the video was captured. The computing device may further include a processor that is configured to execute a video path viewing program and a display that is configured to display a graphical user interface of the video path viewing program. The graphical user interface may be configured to display a path graphic spatially representing the geographical coordinates along which the video was captured a location selector that is selectively movable along the path graphic to a selected path location and a video icon that is configured to display a preview of a portion of the video corresponding to the selected path location.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Furthermore the claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in any part of this disclosure.

The video may be encoded with metadata to identify the geographical coordinates . The geographical coordinates may include latitude and longitude and in some embodiments may include altitude or other identifying information. One type of metadata that may be utilized to identify the geographical coordinates may be referred to as a geovector.

The GUI may be configured to display a path graphic spatially representing the geographical coordinates along which the video was captured. The path graphic may include a line substantially connecting the geographical coordinates and may be determined by the video path viewing program using the geographical coordinates . The path graphic may be displayed on a map of a surrounding geographic area. The path graphic may be depicted in various ways as described below and as illustrated in .

Continuing with the graphical user interface may include a location selector that may be selectively movable along the path graphic to a selected path location and a video icon configured to display a preview of a portion of the video corresponding to the geographical coordinates of the selected path location . A video playback application program may also be resident in the memory and may be configured to play the preview of the video . The video icon may include a window in which the video may be played. The location selector may be a grabbable graphical user interface element referred to as a handle located along the path but alternatively may be a grabbable handle coextensive with or located proximate to the video icon or located at another position that visually corresponds to the path. Thus in some embodiments the video icon may also function as the movable location selector .

Accordingly a location selector movement may be effected by a corresponding icon movement of the video icon. The location selector or the video icon or both may be selectively grabbable with an input device such as a computer mouse or the like which may be coupled with the GUI module . The video icon and the location selector may be linked by a graphical linking element which may graphically illustrate a correspondence between the geographical location and the video .

The preview displayed by the video icon may be selected from the group consisting of a still frame a continuous loop and a one time playback. The video icon may also or instead be configured to scroll through frames of the video as the location selector is moved along the path graphic . The video icon may also or instead be configured such that when a user performs a predetermined action such as double clicking the video icon a full sized version of the video begins playing. Alternatively the video icon may be selectively movable within the GUI and may be configured to scroll through frames of the video as the video icon is moved within the GUI.

Embodiments may provide one or more search visualizations for videos saved in the memory . A user may be able to leverage the geographical coordinates stored with the video to intuitively and quickly find scenes the user is interested in. The user may be more likely to remember the location that a particular scene was recorded in versus a filename of the video or a corresponding file location in the memory . For example a user who recorded his son building a sand castle at Juanita beach in Kirkland Washington two years ago may remember that the event occurred at Juanita beach but may not remember the name of the video file or where within the file the scene is recorded or the file s location in the memory . Accordingly the user may enter a geographic location into the GUI to narrow the search for scenes that take place within a selected radius of the geographic location.

A number of video icons may be displayed on the GUI that may correspond to a number of video files that may have been captured at the same or in some cases at a nearby geographical location. The user may then select one video icon and may either move the location selector or the video icon to review portions of the video to ascertain if the video clip is the one the user is looking for. The file holding the video clip may include other clips that may or may not have been captured at the same geographical location.

The map displayed on the GUI may be an interactive map of the geographic area that may be configured to be zoomed into and zoomed out of and panned through. Zooming in may serve to help the user eliminate certain video clips as clips the user is not looking for as the user begins to recollect a more exact location of the video capture. As the user zooms in and the granularity of the search is increased video icons of non sought video clips may fall off the GUI . Also as the user zooms in the particular portion s of the video that may be part of a larger video file may be easier to locate by providing a scene granular visualization of the video based on geographical location.

Various examples of distinguishing temporal start A from temporal end B of a path graphic follow. indicates an example path graphic including arrows indicating the direction the location selector is to be moved in order to temporally advance the video . The temporal start A and the temporal end B may be inferred from the respective tail of the first arrow and head of the last arrow . indicates an example path graphic indicating the temporal start A and the temporal end B with relatively large visually distinguishable arrows. indicates an example path graphic indicating the temporal start A and the temporal end B with the respective textual identifiers start and end . indicates an example path graphic indicating the temporal start A and the temporal end B and the position along the line segments of varying thickness. indicates an example path graphic indicating the temporal start A from the temporal end B with line segments of varying patterns such as indicated with dotted and dashed lines.

Where appropriate the line characteristic may have segments that may include graphical indication of the length and temporal position of the video for example the segments may be various lengths each varying length indicating graphically the total length of the video clip. For example longer segments may indicate longer total length of video clip.

The receiving of an input of the movement of the movable location selector along the path graphic as illustrated at may be effected by a corresponding movement of the video icon. The previewing illustrated at may be accomplished at least in part by displaying a still frame playing a continuous loop and or playing a one time playback. In addition or alternatively the previewing may include scrolling through frames of the video corresponding to the receiving an input of a movement of the movable selector along the path graphic.

Some embodiments may provide a method wherein the video was captured along an overlapping path that includes overlapping geographical coordinates that are temporally separated the method further comprising graphically representing the overlapping path with an overlapping path characteristic of the path graphic.

The above described systems and methods may be used to efficiently locate video based on geographic location at which the video was captured potentially increasing user productivity and augmenting the user experience.
