Personal Information Manager PIM applications are commonly used by computer users. PIM applications are used for recording tracking and managing personal information for a user. For example a user may use a PIM application to access email contacts and calendar information from one or more providers. The content that is used by the PIM application may be obtained from a variety of different content sources.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

A cloud service stores and aggregates content that is obtained from different content sources using different protocols. For example the content may include electronic messages calendar information contacts social network content feed data search results and the like. The cloud service aggregates content for a user based on the user s configuration settings. For example a user may configure their personal information manager PIM application to include mail from different mail providers. The user may also configure their PIM application to include contacts from a social network as well as calendar events from one or more calendars or content sources. Instead of the client PIM application accessing each of the individual content sources and incorporating the content into the PIM application the cloud service obtains and aggregates the content obtained from the different content sources. The cloud service may perform processing on the aggregated content before it is delivered and displayed to the user on the client device. For example one or more views may be generated and stored by the cloud service before the view is requested from the client. Changes made to the aggregated content on the client may be synchronized with the content source. For example in response to a user making a change to an email that is associated with a different email provider the change is synchronized with the different email provider. Searches may be made across all or a portion of the different content sources that are aggregated for a user. For example a user may view the messages from a particular user regardless of the message provider providing the content to the user. Similarly a user may perform a general search across each of the different content sources to locate items matching a search query.

Referring now to the drawings in which like numerals represent like elements various embodiments will be described.

As illustrated system includes application s content sources search cloud service aggregated content content manager other remote clients and computing device .

Content manager is configured to aggregate content that is obtained from different content sources. According to an embodiment the content is aggregated by the Cloud e.g. online service and is stored by the cloud service . For example the aggregated content may be stored in a data store e.g. aggregated content . The content sources that are aggregated may include many different types of content. For example the content sources may include content relating to electronic messages calendars public private contacts social network content feed data search results and the like.

Using content manager cloud service aggregates content for different users based on the configuration settings that are associated with a user. For example a user may configure their personal information manager PIM application to include mail contacts and calendars from different service providers. The user may also configure their PIM application to include contacts from a social network as well as calendar events from one or more content sources. Instead of a client PIM application accessing each of the individual content providers and storing the content cloud service obtains and aggregates the content that is obtained from the different content sources for the user. According to an embodiment service stores each user s data that is obtained from each content source separately.

According to an embodiment content manager may be configured to augment the aggregated content to include additional content. For example calendar events may be augmented to include traffic information driving directions news information weather information related events and the like. Generally the content is augmented to include additional information relating to the content. Cloud service may augment the aggregated content differently based on the type of the content being augmented. For example electronic messages may be augmented differently as compared to when augmenting calendar events or contact cards.

As illustrated in computing device shows Calendar that displays a weekly view of a calendar that includes different events that may be obtained from different content sources. In the current example augmented content is shown on Apr. 16. The augmented content and the aggregated content may include content from different content sources. For example the content may include traffic information driving directions location information restaurant information social network posts news feeds calendar content mail content and the like.

Changes made to the aggregated content on the client may be synchronized with the external content source. For example in response to a user making a change to an email that is associated with a different email provider content manager synchronizes the change with the content stored by the different email provider.

Cloud service may perform processing on the aggregated content before it is displayed or delivered to the user on a client computing device. For example one or more views may be generated by content manager and stored by the cloud service before the view is requested from the client computing device.

In order to facilitate communication with content manager one or more callback routines may be implemented. Application s may be a variety of applications such as PIM applications business productivity applications entertainment applications music applications travel applications video applications and the like. Generally application s may be any application that includes content that may be aggregated. The application s may be configured to receive different types of input e.g. speech input touch input keyboard input e.g. a physical keyboard and or Software Input Panel SIP and or other types of input.

System as illustrated comprises one or more touch screen input devices such as computing device that detects when a touch input has been received e.g. a finger touching or nearly touching the touch screen . Any type of touch screen may be utilized that detects a user s touch input. For example the touch screen may include one or more layers of capacitive material that detects the touch input. More details are provided below.

As illustrated system includes content sources synchronization engine content manager including aggregator and augmenter data store cloud service client and other clients . Instead of a client application connecting with each different content provider to obtain content service using content manager obtains and aggregates content from content sources . According to an embodiment a client e.g. client may use a single protocol to communicate with the different content obtained by cloud service .

As discussed above content sources may include many different content sources. For example content sources may include feed sources Personal Information Management PIM sources e.g. OUTLOOK GMAIL YAHOO that include content relating to electronic messages calendars tasks and the like social network sources e.g. TWITTER FACEBOOK LINKEDIN . . . weather sources entertainment sources map and navigation sources public calendar sources private calendar sources and the like. Generally a content source may be any source from which content may be obtained from and aggregated for a user.

Each client user may determine what content they would like aggregated. For example when a user first accesses cloud service they may configure what content sources they would like to include e.g. mail from GMAIL and YAHOO as well as OUTLOOK email . The user may also select social network sources e.g. YAMMER SHAREPOINT FACEBOOK TWITTER . . . feeds and the like. For example the use may select to include contacts and contact info FACEBOOK GMAIL TWITTER LINKEDIN and the like.

In response to the user selections of the content sources content manager uses aggregator to obtain the content from the content source. The retrieved content is stored in the cloud service in data store . According to an embodiment each content source that is selected by a user to be aggregated is stored separately within data store . In other words the content from one content source is not mixed with content from another content source. According to another embodiment the content sources may be stored mixed within data store .

Aggregator may obtain content from the content sources in response to different events. For example aggregator may obtain content periodically in response to a notification or in response to some other event.

Synchronization engine is configured to act an interface between the cloud service and the content sources. Different content sources may use different protocols to allow access to content in a content source. For example the Internet Message Access Protocol IMAP is a generic protocol for email that may be used by one or more content sources. Other common protocols include Exchange Web Service EWS Messaging Application Programming Interface MAPI Exchange Active Sync EAS Post Office Protocol POP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP as well as many other protocols that may be associated with accessing and interacting with content in a content source. Some content sources may use their own defined protocol or may modify a common protocol. Synchronization engine interacts with each content source using the protocol that is associated with the content source being accessed.

Synchronization engine is configured to aggregate provider specific content. Instead of just using a generic protocol e.g. IMAP MAPI . . . to obtain content from each content source specific provider synchronization interfaces may be created and used to obtain additional content and information from the content source. For example the provider specific interfaces may obtain information form the provider for one or more provider specific features. For example a provider specific interface to the GMAIL service may obtain labels in GMAIL and map that information to the same feature or another feature used when a client accesses the GMAIL content e.g. map label in GMAIL to a mail folder . According to another embodiment the provider synchronization interfaces may be configured to maintain the use of provider specific features. Generally the provider specific interfaces are configured to access features of a content provider that are not available using a common protocol that is associated with the service provider. For example while mail may be obtained from a mail service provider using a protocol the defined protocol may not provide functionality to interface with all of the different features that are provided by the service provider.

According to an embodiment synchronization engine is configured to allow two way synchronization between the different content sources and data store in the cloud service. For example a user e.g. client may make a change to an email that was obtained from a different mail service provider that is synchronized back to the different service provider. This is different from traditional applications that download the content to an application but do not synchronize changes back to the service after a change is made. As another example a user may add a folder in the client that translates in mapping the folder to a label. The provider synchronization interface logic is specific logic that applies to each content provider. Content may be synchronized to different fidelity levels.

The aggregated content for a user may be augmented with additional content using augmenter . The content may be augmented in response to an item being created e.g. an appointment a message and or augmented at some other time. For example the content may be aggregated when the user opens a view of the content.

The following examples of augmenting content are examples and are not intended to be limiting. A view of a user s calendar may be augmented using public calendar feeds. For example the calendar feeds could be sports calendars school calendars social experiences home schedules and the like. Information relating to the calendar may also be obtained from other sources. A search may automatically be performed to locate content that is referenced in a message in a calendar in a task and the like. For example when viewing the calendar that includes a schedule of games the scores of the games may automatically be added to the view after performing a search for the score.

Instead of each client having to obtain the content directly from the content sources using the different protocols and storing the aggregated information on the client computing device the cloud service stores the content performs the aggregation and delivers aggregated content to a client using a single communication channel a single delivery protocol .

Client interacts with the cloud service using a single protocol even though cloud service used many different protocols to obtain the aggregated content. According to an embodiment client is a thin and portable client e.g. it does not need to include the synchronization logic protocols and other functionality that cloud service includes . Other clients also communicate with cloud service to access their aggregated content.

Content manager is also configured to create view s of content before it is requested by a client. For example a common view e.g. a weekly view of a user s calendar may be created in advance of the view being requested. The aggregated content may be organized into different views e.g. month view week view . . . . Each different view contains the data used to render the UI for that view. When the user opens a calendar a current view may be loaded from memory e.g. a cache . Other stored view data is delivered to the user when requested. Data views may also be created for other common views e.g. contacts mail tasks . . . .

Display shows a user performing Search 1 in browser to locate items obtained from different content sources. The user may select the content sources that they would like searched. In response to performing Search results are shown. As can be seen different items from different content sources that were aggregated for the user were located in the search. Instead of the user having to search each different content source separately two or more content sources may be searched at a single time.

Display shows user performing a search to locate the message from User across different content sources. The user may select the content sources that they would like searched. In response to performing search results are shown. As can be seen messages from different content sources and message providers are shown on a single display. Instead of the user having to search each different content source separately for messages from the user two or more content sources may be searched at a single time.

After a start operation the process moves to operation where a determination is made as to what content sources a user would like to aggregate. According to an embodiment the content sources include content relating to electronic messages calendars public private contacts social network content feed data search results and the like. For example a user may select to aggregate electronic messages from different message providers e.g. OUTLOOK GMAIL YAHOO . . . contacts from one or more content providers e.g. LINKEDIN OUTLOOK FACEBOOK GMAIL . . . calendars from different content providers e.g. public or private and the like.

Transitioning to operation the cloud service obtains the content from the different content sources. The cloud service uses different protocols to obtain content from the content sources. For example the cloud service may obtain content using protocols such as Internet Message Access Protocol IMAP Exchange Web Service EWS Messaging Application Programming Interface MAPI Exchange Active Sync EAS Post Office Protocol POP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP as well as many other protocols that may be associated with accessing and interacting with content in a content source. Some content sources may use their own defined protocol or may modify a common protocol. The cloud service interacts with each content source using the protocol that is associated with the content source being accessed.

According to an embodiment the cloud service includes custom provider synchronization interfaces to at least a portion of the content providers. The provider synchronization interfaces are used to obtain additional content and information from the content source than the content that may be obtained using the standard protocol. The provider specific interfaces may obtain information form the provider for one or more provider specific features. Generally the provider specific interfaces are configured to access features of a content provider that are not available using a common protocol that is associated with the service provider. For example while mail may be obtained from a mail service provider using a protocol the defined protocol may not provide functionality to interface with all of the different features that are provided by the service provider. The content may be obtained and updated using different methods. For example the obtained content may be updated periodically in response to a notification or in response to some other event.

Flowing to operation the obtained content is aggregated for the user and stored by the cloud service. According to an embodiment each content source that is selected by a user to be aggregated is stored separately within data store . In other words the content from one content source is not mixed with content from another content source. In this way the user s content that is stored by the online service may be easily located and each content source may be easily identified.

Transitioning to operation the aggregated content may be processed by the cloud service. For example the aggregated content may be augmented with additional content and or views may be created in advance of the view being requested by a client. For example a common view e.g. a weekly view of a user s calendar may be created in advance of the view being requested. The aggregated content may be organized into different views e.g. month view week view . . . and stored for later use. Each different view created by the cloud service contains the data used to render a User Interface display for that view on a client computing device.

Flowing to operation aggregated content is delivered to a client using a single communication channel e.g. a single delivery protocol . The client interacts with the aggregated data that is stored by cloud service using a single protocol even though cloud service used different protocols to obtain the aggregated content. According to an embodiment the client is a thin client e.g. a web browser that uses the cloud service to perform computations and processing relating to the aggregated content. For example the cloud service provides PIM services that are typically found in a desktop PIM application.

After a start operation the process moves to operation where the cloud service is accessed. The cloud service stores the aggregated content for a user. According to an embodiment the aggregated content includes content relating to electronic messages calendar information and contacts obtained from different content sources. Other content may be aggregated. According to an embodiment the cloud service provides services relating to interacting with and viewing electronic messages calendar information and contacts. Other cloud services may include other aggregated content and provide other services.

Transitioning to operation a user selects a view to display using their client application e.g. browser thin client . For example a user may make a selection to display a calendar view e.g. yearly monthly weekly daily an electronic message a contact a task and the like. Generally the view is related to the functionality of the cloud service.

Flowing to operation the aggregated content relating to the view is obtained from the cloud service and the view is displayed at the client. According to an embodiment the view is obtained from the cloud service. For example when the view has already been created by the cloud service the view is obtained from a memory e.g. a cache or network storage and delivered to the client for display.

Transitioning to operation a user interacts with the view. For example a user may make changes to the view change the content create a message create an event and the like. A user may also perform a search across one or more of the different content sources that are included in the aggregated content. For example a user may look for messages from particular user across each of their mailboxes look for contacts obtained from different contact sources and the like.

Flowing to operation changes made to the aggregated content are synchronized with the external content source. According to an embodiment instead of just changing the content at the cloud service the cloud service changes the content at the cloud service and synchronizes the change with the external content source. For example if a user adds a calendar event to a calendar obtained from service provider then the cloud service synchronizes the calendar that is stored by service provider . In this way when a user accesses the calendar using an application supplied by service provider the change to the calendar is shown.

As illustrated service is a cloud based and or enterprise based service that may be configured to provide services such as services related to various applications e.g. whiteboards searching games browsing locating productivity services e.g. spreadsheets documents presentations charts messages and the like . The service may be interacted with using different types of input output. For example a user may use speech input touch input hardware based input and the like. The service may provide speech output that combines pre recorded speech and synthesized speech. Functionality of one or more of the services applications provided by service may also be configured as a client server based application.

As illustrated service is a multi tenant service that provides resources and services to any number of tenants e.g. Tenants N . Multi tenant service is a cloud based service that provides resources services to tenants subscribed to the service and maintains each tenant s data separately and protected from other tenant data.

System as illustrated comprises a touch screen input device e.g. a slate tablet device and smart phone that detects when a touch input has been received e.g. a finger touching or nearly touching the touch screen . Any type of touch screen may be utilized that detects a user s touch input. For example the touch screen may include one or more layers of capacitive material that detects the touch input. Other sensors may be used in addition to or in place of the capacitive material. For example Infrared IR sensors may be used. According to an embodiment the touch screen is configured to detect objects that in contact with or above a touchable surface. Although the term above is used in this description it should be understood that the orientation of the touch panel system is irrelevant. The term above is intended to be applicable to all such orientations. The touch screen may be configured to determine locations of where touch input is received e.g. a starting point intermediate points and an ending point . Actual contact between the touchable surface and the object may be detected by any suitable means including for example by a vibration sensor or microphone coupled to the touch panel. A non exhaustive list of examples for sensors to detect contact includes pressure based mechanisms micro machined accelerometers piezoelectric devices capacitive sensors resistive sensors inductive sensors laser vibrometers and LED vibrometers.
