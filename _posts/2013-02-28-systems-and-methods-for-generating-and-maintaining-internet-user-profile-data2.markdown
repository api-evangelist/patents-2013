title: Systems and methods for generating and maintaining internet user profile data
abstract: Systems and methods are provided for automatically generating and maintaining user profile cookie sets. The user profile cookie sets may be used by a web crawler when gathering data such as advertisement data associated with one or more websites. The cookie sets may be generated by choosing a user profile with a set of user traits, selecting a set of websites related to the user traits, and browsing the selected set of websites using a web crawler while allowing the website to place cookies in storage of the web crawler. The cookie sets may be maintained by selecting a website to browse, selecting a user profile associated with the selected website, loading a previously generated cookie set for the selected user profile into the storage of a web crawler, and loading the webpage while allowing the website to place, update, or replace cookies in the storage of the web crawler.

This application claims the benefit of provisional patent application No. 61 605 392 filed Mar. 1 2012 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

This invention relates generally to web based information and more specifically to systems for generating and maintaining user profile data for web crawling applications.

Publishers of websites such as newspaper web pages television station web pages web log web pages magazine web pages social networking web pages microblogging web pages and other internet based online publishing sources often place data onto the computing system of a user of the website when the user loads the website.

The data that is placed by the publisher is often referred to as a cookie. When the user returns to the website at a later time the publisher detects the presence of the cookie on the user s computing system. The publisher often alters the content of the website based on the detected cookie and additional data associated with that user that is stored by the publisher.

For example the publisher website may place advertisements articles or other content on the website that are targeted to that particular user. In some scenarios third party companies such as data gathering companies also place cookies onto user s computing equipment.

Data tracking systems sometimes use web crawlers to gather data about the content of a given publisher webpage. In some scenarios it would be beneficial to be able to simulate various types of human website users using cookies. However because human users visit a variety of websites and because cookies often have expiration dates and times it can be challenging to obtain a set of cookies that is useful for simulating human users.

It would therefore be desirable to be able to provide improved systems for generating and maintaining user profile data such as user profile cookie sets.

Systems and methods are provided for generating and maintaining user profile cookie sets. The user profile cookie sets may be used for simulating an internet user having a specific user profile. For example a data collection system may use the user profile cookie sets to simulate a user of a website while gathering data such as advertisement data associated with advertisements that are displayed on the website.

A system such as a cookie set generating and maintenance system may include cookie harvesting computing equipment one or more databases and one or more proxy servers.

The cookie harvesting computing equipment may include computing equipment for running one or more web crawling applications. The computing equipment may include storage such as cookie storage for storing the cookie sets as they are generated and updated.

The databases may include a user profile database and a site specific user population database. The user profile database may include user profiles for simulated human internet users and one or more cookie sets associated with each user profile. Each user profile may include a set of user traits such as a gender an age an income and a list of interests or interest keywords for that user. A cookie set associated with each set of user traits may be a cookie set that is indicative of a typical human user with that set of user traits.

The site specific user population database may include user population segmentation data specific to each of a plurality of websites. The site specific segmentation data may include statistical data about the people that access that website such as the percentage of people in a given age range or income range that visit the website.

Generating the cookie sets may include selecting a user profile obtaining site specific segmentation data for a plurality of websites selecting a set of websites using the user profile and the site specific segmentation data and using a web crawler to load each of the selected set of websites while allowing each website to place and edit cookies in the cookie storage of the web crawler. The system may then place the cookies in the web crawler cookie storage into the user profile database in a location that is associated with the selected user profile.

Maintaining the cookie sets may include selecting a website to explore obtaining site specific segmentation data for that website selecting a user profile selecting a cookie set for that user profile moving the selected cookie set to a web crawler cookie storage using the web crawler to load the selected website while allowing the website publisher to update the cookies in the cookie storage of the web crawler and storing the updated cookie set in the user profile database.

Additional website analysis operations such as advertisement tracking and discovery operations may be performed while the cookie set is being updated.

Further features of the invention its nature and various advantages will be more apparent from the accompanying drawings and the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments.

An illustrative system for generating and maintaining user profile cookie sets is shown in . System may be used to generate cookie sets to be used while simulating a human internet user browsing a webpage. System may also be used to automatically maintain the generated cookie sets. System may if desired by embedded in a larger system for performing website analysis operations such as advertisement discovery and tracking operations if desired.

Cookie harvesting computing equipment may include one or more personal computers workstations computers configured as servers mainframe computers portable computers etc. Equipment may include processing circuitry displays input output devices and storage e.g. hard drives volatile memory non volatile memory and other storage media . Equipment may be used to run code for software applications such as one or more web crawling applications .

Each web crawler may include storage such as cookie storage for storing one or more cookies in a cookie set while browsing crawling one or more web pages. Cookie storage may include storage space in storage media such as hard drives volatile memory non volatile memory and other storage media that are co located with web crawler or that are remotely accessible by web crawler .

System may include one or more databases . Databases may be co located with cookie harvesting computing equipment of system and or may include remote storage such as cloud based storage. If desired cookie harvesting computing equipment may be used to access stored information from databases and or provide information to databases . Databases may include information stored on storage media such as hard drives volatile memory non volatile memory and other storage media associated with workstations computers configured as servers mainframe computers portable computers etc.

Databases may include one or more databases such as user profile database and site specific user population database . User profile database may be used to store user profiles associated with human internet users to be simulated by system . User profiles stored in user profile database may each include a set of user traits and one or more sets of cookies e.g. web browser cookies Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP cookies etc. associated with each set of user traits. Site specific user population database may be used to store statistical data associated with the population of users that access one or more particular websites.

Cookie harvesting computing equipment may access data from user profile database and or site specific user population database may select a user profile from user profile database may select a cookie set associated with the selected user profile may provide generated cookie sets and or updated cookie sets to user profile database or may perform other cookie generating and maintenance operations for system .

Cookie harvesting computing equipment may be implemented using multiple virtual computers on a common computing platform using separate computing platforms in a common room in a building using separate computing platforms in separate rooms in a common building using separate computing platforms in a common geographical location e.g. a common city or using multiple computing platforms in multiple geographical locations. As examples cookie harvesting computing equipment may include separate computing platforms that are located in multiple different cities.

Cookie harvesting computing equipment may use web crawler s to generate and maintain one or more cookie sets for each user profile.

For example equipment may be used to generate the cookie sets by selecting a user profile obtaining site specific segmentation data for a plurality of websites selecting a set of websites using the user profile and the site specific segmentation data and using a web crawler to load each of the selected set of websites while allowing each website to place and edit cookies in the cookie storage of the web crawler. Cookies in the generated cookie set in the web crawler cookie storage may then be moved into the user profile database in a location that is associated with the selected user profile.

As another example equipment may be used to maintain and update the cookie sets by selecting a website to explore obtaining site specific segmentation data for that website selecting a user profile selecting a cookie set for that user profile obtaining the selected cookie set from the user profile database and using the web crawler to load the selected website while allowing the website publisher to update the cookies in the cookie storage of the web crawler. Updated cookies in the generated cookie set in the web crawler cookie storage may then be moved into the user profile database in a location that is associated with the selected user profile.

As shown in system may include multiple implementations of cookie harvesting computing equipment connected to one or more of multiple publisher servers over network .

One or more web crawlers see running on each implementation of cookie harvesting computing equipment may be used to access and explore one or more publisher web pages that are hosted on publisher servers . If desired web crawlers running on cookie harvesting computing equipment in one geographical location e.g. a country or a region of a country may be used to access and explore publisher web pages in that geographical location. However this is merely illustrative. If desired web crawling applications running on cookie harvesting computing equipment in one geographical location may access publisher servers in another geographical location e.g. another country or another region of a country directly as indicated by lines or though a proxy server as indicated by lines that is located in a common geographical location e.g. a common country or region of a country with those publisher servers .

During operation of system cookie harvesting computing equipment may select a user profile from user profile database obtain site specific segmentation data from database and generate or update a cookie set for that selected user profile.

Cookie harvesting equipment may generate and update user profile cookie sets by selecting websites associated with a user profile and using web crawlers to access the selected websites while permitting the website or a third party to place and or update cookies in the cookie storage of the web crawler. For example cookie harvesting equipment may load a web page associated with a publisher server using one of web crawlers . While loading the web page the publisher server may instruct the web crawler web browser to load one or more assets from additional servers . These assets may include HTML assets scripts image files videos etc. When loading these assets from additional servers servers may instruct the web crawler to load more assets from other servers and so on. Cookie harvesting equipment may allow any of publisher servers and or additional servers to read write and or update cookies in the web crawler cookie storage during this process.

As shown in cookie harvesting computing equipment may be implemented as a portion of a larger data gathering and analysis system such as advertisement tracking and discovery system .

System may include advertisement discovery equipment data analysis and storage equipment customer interface equipment or other computing equipment.

Advertisement discovery equipment may include computing equipment . Computing equipment may include one or more personal computers workstations computers configured as servers mainframe computers portable computers processing circuitry displays input output devices and storage e.g. hard drives volatile memory non volatile memory and other storage media . Computing equipment of advertisement discovery equipment may be used to run code for software applications such as one or more additional web crawling applications and data processing applications such as data reduction application . Data reduction application may be used to process advertisement related data that has been gathered using web crawler s e.g. modified web crawling web browsers or dedicated web crawling applications .

Each web crawler of advertisement discovery equipment may also include storage for storing a cookie set that has been generated by cookie generation and maintenance system while browsing crawling one or more web pages. Cookie storage of advertisement discovery equipment may include storage space in storage media such as hard drives volatile memory non volatile memory and other storage media that are co located with web crawler or that are remotely accessible by web crawler .

Advertisement discovery equipment may access data from user profile database and or site specific user population database may select a user profile from user profile database may select a cookie set associated with the selected user profile or may perform other user simulating operations for system . However this is merely illustrative. If desired data analysis and storage equipment may be used to access data from user profile database and or site specific user population database to select a user profile from user profile database to select a cookie set associated with the selected user profile to initiate transfers of data between databases and advertisement discovery equipment or to perform other user simulating operations for system using cookie sets generated by system .

Data analysis and storage equipment may include computing equipment . Computing equipment of data analysis and storage equipment may be co located with computing equipment of advertisement discovery equipment or computing equipment of data analysis and storage equipment may be separate from computing equipment of advertisement discovery equipment .

As examples cookie harvesting computing equipment computing equipment of data analysis and storage equipment and computing equipment of advertisement discovery equipment may be implemented using multiple virtual computers on a common computing platform using separate computing platforms in a common room in a building using separate computing platforms in separate rooms in a common building or using separate computing platforms in a common geographical location e.g. a common city . However this is merely illustrative. If desired cookie harvesting computing equipment may include multiple computing platforms in multiple geographical locations that are separated from computing equipment of data analysis and storage equipment and computing equipment of advertisement discovery equipment .

If desired cookie harvesting computing equipment may be used to perform some or all of the functions of computing equipment of advertisement discovery equipment or computing equipment of advertisement discovery equipment may be used to perform some or all of the functions of cookie harvesting computing equipment .

Advertisement discovery equipment may use web crawler s to access and explore publisher web pages gather advertisement related data from those publisher web pages process the gathered data and provide the processed data to data analysis and storage equipment . Data analysis and storage equipment may be used to accumulate aggregate and store advertisement related data.

Computing equipment of data analysis and storage equipment may include storage such as one or more databases and other computing equipment e.g. one or more personal computers workstations computers configured as servers mainframe computers portable computers processing circuitry displays and input output devices that can be used to run code for software applications such as one or more data aggregation and distribution applications . Data aggregation and distribution applications may be used to accumulate and aggregate data received from advertisement discovery equipment and if desired to generate customer alert emails.

Customer interface equipment may be used to provide a customer with access to advertisement related information such as aggregated advertisement data stored in data analysis and storage equipment . Computing equipment of customer interface equipment may include one or more personal computers workstations computers configured as servers mainframe computers portable computers etc.

Computing equipment of customer interface equipment may include processing circuitry displays input output devices and storage e.g. hard drives volatile memory non volatile memory and other storage media . Computing equipment of customer interface equipment may form a portion of computing equipment of data analysis and storage equipment or may be formed separately from computing equipment of data analysis and storage equipment .

Computing equipment of customer interface equipment may be used to run code for software applications such as one or more communications applications . Communications applications may be used to provide customers with access to advertisement related information such as user profile sorted aggregated advertisement data that is stored in data analysis and storage equipment .

Communications applications may include a web portal for providing authenticated web access to portions of data stored in data analysis and storage equipment e.g. using a customer s web browser a file transfer protocol application for providing bulk access to portions of data stored in data analysis and storage equipment an Application Programming Interface API and or an email generating application that generates and sends alert emails to customers e.g. periodic alert emails or emails generated in response to a detected change in advertisement related information .

Each advertisement block may include one or more advertisements . Each advertisement may be as examples an advertiser related image video animation text link or other advertisement. Advertisements may sometimes be referred to as advertiser creatives or simply as creatives. For example an advertiser creative may include a jpeg image of a product and an embedded clickable link to a web site that sells that product.

System may be used to identify advertisement blocks to identify advertisers that advertise in those advertisement blocks to record individual advertiser creatives or text links displayed in those advertisement blocks and to identify advertising channels that placed those advertiser creatives or text links in those advertisement blocks.

Some or all of advertisements may be placed on web page in response to detection of a set of cookies stored by a web browser or crawler when page is loaded. For example if page is loaded by a human user that has recently visited multiple sports related web pages the human user s browser may have obtained sports related cookies that identify the user as a sports enthusiast.

In response to detection of those sports related cookies advertisements may be placed on page that are for sports related products. In another example system may provide one of crawlers of advertisement discovery equipment with a user profile cookie set from system associated with a user profile of a user that is a sports enthusiast. In response to detection of sports related cookies in that cookie set advertisements may be placed on page that are for sports related products. In this way system may induce web page into presenting ads that are commonly presented to various types of human user.

System may be used to generate and maintain this type of user profile cookie set. System may for example use one of web crawlers of cookie harvesting computing equipment to load a website such as website using an empty cookie set and may download cookie into cookie storage of the web crawler. However this is merely illustrative. If desired system may for example use one of web crawlers of cookie harvesting computing equipment to load a website such as website using a previously generated cookie set and may replace a previously downloaded cookie in the cookie storage of the web crawler with an updated cookie such as cookie .

System may be used to browse a web page such as web page while generating and updating user profile cookie sets for each of one two three more than three ten more than ten hundreds thousands or millions of different types of human users using user profiles of those types of human users. If desired system may browse a web page such as web page multiple times while updating multiple cookie sets for the same type of human user or while generating multiple new cookie sets for the same type of human user.

If desired data gathering systems such as system may use user profile cookie sets generated by system to compile analyze and display web based data such as advertisement data associated with advertisements advertisers associated with advertisements advertising channels that place advertisements and publishers that publish advertisements to a customer.

Cookie harvesting computing equipment may be used to generate multiple cookie sets e.g. COOKIE SET and COOKIE SET of USER PROFILE associated with a first user profile USER PROFILE that includes an associated first user trait set USER TRAIT SET and multiple cookie sets e.g. COOKIE SET and COOKIE SET of USER PROFILE associated with a second user profile USER PROFILE that includes an associated second user trait set USER TRAIT SET etc.

User profile database may include one two three more than three ten more than ten hundreds more than hundreds thousands more than thousands millions or more than millions of user profiles . Cookie harvesting computing equipment may be used to generate one two three more than three ten more than ten hundreds more than hundreds thousands more than thousands millions or more than millions of cookie sets associated with the user trait set of each user profile. Each user trait set may be a particular combination of user traits of the type shown in .

As shown in a user trait set may include one or more user traits . Each user trait set may be defined by the particular combination of user traits in that user trait set. User traits may include a user gender e.g. male or female a user age or user age range e.g. 0 15 years YRS of age 15 25 years of age 25 35 years of age 35 45 years of age 45 55 years of age 55 65 years of age 65 75 years of age 75 85 years of age 85 95 years of age 95 105 years of age more than 65 years of age less than 65 years of age more than 30 years of age less than 30 years of age or any other suitable age or age range a user income or income range e.g. 0 10000 10001 20000 20001 30000 30001 40000 40001 50000 50001 60000 60001 70000 70001 80000 80001 90000 90001 100000 100001 110000 110001 120000 120001 130000 130001 140000 140001 150000 150001 160000 160001 170000 170001 180000 180001 190000 190001 200000 more than 200000 less than 200000 more than 250000 less than 250000 more than 30000 less than 30000 or any other suitable income value or income rage one or more user interests e.g. food automobiles travel sports music fishing literature shoes computers crafts art theater scuba diving television movies electronics games gaming or other user interests or any other user suitable traits e.g. weight height education level religion etc. .

Each user trait set may be formed from a particular combination of user traits . For example a user trait set may be defined by user traits male 25 35 years of age 50 000 60 000 income interested in travel. Another user trait set may be defined by female 55 65 years of age 90 000 100 000 income interested in travel music and art. User profile database may include user profiles having user trait sets that include any number of non contradictory user traits .

As a typical human internet user browses web pages on the internet some web page publishers and other data gathering organizations may instruct the user s browser to download one or more cookies onto the user s computer. The publishers or data gathering organizations often store data associated with the web sites and products that user views on the internet. Later those cookies can be detected by the publisher or the data gatherer and the publisher or data gatherer can access the stored data associated with those cookies and determine the type of content and products that user is interested in. Advertisements can then be presented that are related to the interests of that specific user.

A typical human user will therefore have a set of browser cookies stored on their computer that indicate the user traits of that user. Cookie harvesting equipment may be used to generate cookie sets that resemble or match the set of browser cookies of a particular type of human user. As shown in a given cookie set may include a cookie associated with a news organization e.g. a NEWSORGANIZATION.COM cookie a cookie associated with a retail store e.g. a RETAILSTORE.COM cookie a cookie associated with a sports magazine e.g. a SPORTSMAGAZINE.COM cookie a cookie associated with a data gathering organization that tracks user browsing movements across multiple publisher web pages e.g. a WEBTRACKER.COM cookie or any other suitable cookie. The news organization the retail store the sports magazine and the data gathering organization may each store data linked with their cookie .

Because various internet users with the same user traits e.g. two 25 year old male internet users with incomes between 35000 and 45000 will typically visit different web pages and view different products system may generate and store multiple different cookie sets for each user trait set .

User population statistics for a URL may include user population gender percentages e.g. 54 Male 46 Female user population age percentages e.g. 1 0 15 YRS 40 15 25 YRS etc. user population income percentages e.g. 7 0 10 000 24 10 001 20 000 etc. or other statistics for the population of human users of the web page at that URL. As shown in the example of a first URL such as URL may have associated URL USER POPULATION GENDER statistics URL USER POPULATION AGE statistics URL USER POPULATION INCOME statistics or other statistics of the user population.

During operation cookie harvesting equipment may extract user population percentages such as the percentage of male users and the percentage of female users of a particular web page from statistics of data and use the extracted user population percentages to probabilistically select a user profile or a set of web pages to be used when generating and updating user profile cookie sets. In this way system can choose a distribution of users for exploring a web page that is statistically matched with the real human user population for that web page or a distribution of web pages to explore that are statistically matched with a particular user profile.

Site specific segmentation data may be obtained or purchased from a third party data provider such as data provider of .

Illustrative steps that may be involved in generating storing maintaining and updating user profile cookie sets using a system of the type shown in are shown in .

At step a system such as system of may be used to generate and store one or more cookie sets for each user profile in a user profile database.

At step a user profile may be selected from the user profile database that is to be used for web crawling operations such as advertisement discovery and tracking operations of the type described above in connection with .

At step a cookie set such as one of the cookie sets generated at step may be obtained from the user profile database.

At step a system such as system of or system of may be used to browse and or crawl publisher web pages while permitting read access and write access to the obtained cookie set.

As indicated by line a system such as system may then be used to update a cookie set in the user profile database at step . However this is merely illustrative. If desired a system such as system may return to step and generate one or more additional cookie sets for each user profile as indicated by line .

If desired the cookie set updating operations of step may be performed in a common step with the browsing and crawling operations of step .

Illustrative steps that may be involved in generating and storing cookie sets as described above in connection with step of are shown in .

At step web crawler cookie storage such as cookie storage of one of web crawlers of equipment may be cleared.

At step a user profile having a set of associated user traits may be selected from a database such as user profile database .

At step site specific segmentation data such as data of may be obtained from site specific user population database .

At step a set of websites to be browsed during cookie set generation operations may be selected using the user traits of the selected user profile and the obtained site specific segmentation data.

At step the selected website and resources e.g. advertisements scripts etc. associated with the selected website may be loaded using the cookie harvesting equipment while allowing the website e.g. the publisher server other servers associated with assets such as HTML code scripts image files videos or other assets that are linked to the website or any other server associated with the website to place and edit cookies in the web crawler cookie storage.

As indicated by line steps and may be repeated e.g. until all of the set of websites have been selected and browsed .

At step the added and edited cookies in the web crawler cookie storage may be moved or copied to the user profile database and stored along with the associated user profile. If desired the steps of may be repeated for each user profile in the user profile database.

Illustrative steps that may be involved in selecting a set of websites as described above in connection with step of are shown in .

At step user population percentages such as the percentage of users that are male and the percentage of users of the selected website that are female as examples of each of a plurality of websites may be extracted from the site specific segmentation data obtained at step of .

At step the extracted user population percentages of each website may be compared to user traits of the user profile selected at step of .

At step a probability may be assigned to each of the plurality of websites based on the comparison of the extracted user population percentages and the user trait sets. For example a user profile may have a user trait set of a female with an income of 44 000 per year. The user population percentages of a particular website may indicate for example that 30 of the selected website s users are female and that 40 of the selected website s users have an income range of 40 000 50 000. System may then assign a gender probability factor of 0.3 and an income probability factor of 0.4 to that website as examples .

System may then combine the gender probability factor the income probability factor and other probability factors based on other user traits and user population percentages into a probability for that website. In the current example the website probability may be computed as the product of the individual probability factors e.g. website probability factor 0.3 0.4 . However this is merely illustrative. Probability factors associated with any user traits and any user population percentages may be combined in any suitable way to generate a website probability for each website and the selected user profile.

At step as set of websites to browse may be probabilistically selected based on the assigned probabilities of the websites. For example websites having a website probability of 0.9 may be more likely to be selected than websites having a website probability of 0.2. In this way the probabilistic selection of the set of websites may be designed so that more websites having relatively high website probabilities are selected but some websites having relatively low website probabilities are also selected.

Because a real human internet user will typically visit many websites that are associated with the traits of that user and a few other websites that are not as closely associated with the traits of that user e.g. a middle age high income music enthusiast may visit many instrument retailer websites but also may occasionally visit a fertilizer website a system such as system in which low probability websites are occasionally selected but less often than high probability websites can more accurately simulate the cookie sets of a real human population of users.

Illustrative steps that may be involved in updating cookie sets as described above in connection with step of are shown in .

At step a URL of a website web page to be explored crawled may be selected. The URL may be selected randomly may be selected probabilistically based on segmentation data for the website may be selected from a list of URLs or may be selected based on the content of the website as examples .

At step site specific segmentation data of the type shown in for the selected website e.g. the website at the selected URL may be obtained.

At step a user profile of the type shown in may be selected from user profile database using the obtained site specific segmentation data.

At step a cookie set associated with the selected user profile may be selected from user profile database .

At step the selected cookie set may be moved or copied from the user profile database to web crawler cookie storage such as cookie storage of one of web crawlers of cookie harvesting equipment .

At step the selected website and resources e.g. advertisements scripts etc. associated with the selected website may be loaded using the advertisement discovery equipment while allowing the publisher server of the website e.g. the publisher server other servers associated with assets such as HTML code scripts image files videos or other assets that are linked to the website or any other server associated with the website to update the cookie set that has been moved to the web crawler cookie storage e.g. by placing additional cookies in the web crawler cookie storage or replacing or updating existing cookies in the web crawler cookie storage .

At step if desired website analysis operations such as advertisement discovery and tracking operations may be performed e.g. using advertisement discovery equipment of and or cookie harvesting equipment . However this is merely illustrative. If desired the cookie set in the web crawler cookie store may be updated without performing any additional website analysis operations.

As indicated by line steps and optionally may be repeated for multiple user profiles for a given selected website.

At step the updated cookie set may be stored in the user profile database in connection with the selected user profile.

Illustrative steps that may be involved in selecting a user profile from the user profile database using obtained site specific segmentation data as described above in connection with step of are shown in .

At step user population percentages such as the percentage of users of the selected website that are male and the percentage of users of the selected website that are female as examples may be extracted from the obtained site specific segmentation data obtained at step of .

At step the extracted user population percentages may be compared to user traits in the user trait set of each user profile in the user profile database.

At step a probability may be assigned to each user profile in the user profile database based on the comparison of the extracted user population percentages and the user trait sets. For example a user profile may have a user trait set of a female with an income of 44 000 per year. The user population percentages may indicate for example that 30 of the selected website s users are female and that 40 of the selected website s users have an income range of 40 000 50 000. System may then assign a gender probability factor of 0.3 and an income probability factor of 0.4 to that user profile as examples .

System may then combine the gender probability factor the income probability factor and other probability factors based on other user traits and user population percentages into a probability for that user profile. In the current example the user profile probability may be computed as the product of the individual probability factors e.g. user profile probability factor 0.3 0.4 . However this is merely illustrative. Probability factors associated with any user traits and any user population percentages may be combined in any suitable way to generate a user profile probability for each user profile.

At step a user profile may be probabilistically selected based on the assigned probabilities of the user profiles. For example a user profile having a user profile probability of 0.9 may be more likely to be selected than a user profile having a user profile probability of 0.2. In this way the probabilistic selection of the user profile may be designed to that cookie sets of user profiles having relatively high user profile probabilities are updated with the cookies of a given website proportionally for example more often than cookie sets of user profiles having relatively low user profile probabilities are updated with the cookies of that website.

Because the cookie collections of a real human internet user can vary greatly e.g. the cookie set of a middle age high income music enthusiast may include many cookies from instrument retailers but also a cookie from a fertilizer retailer a system such as system in which cookie sets of low probability user profiles are occasionally used to browse a website but less often than cookie sets of high probability user profiles can more accurately simulate the cookie set of a real human user.

Illustrative steps that may be involved in performing website analysis operations such as gathering and processing advertisement data as described above in connection with step of are shown in .

At step HTTP request data may be gathered and stored from publisher servers and linked servers associated with selected website. HTTP request data may include information associated with each HTTP request made while loading the selected website such as the URL of the request a time of the request a response body of the response to the request e.g. the HTML JavaScript code or other code of the page associated with the request an HTTP response code of the response to the request e.g. a success failure or redirect response and a redirect response header e.g. a web page or other resource that a browser is redirected to in the case of a redirect response code .

At step the HTTP request list may be processed to form processed advertisement data. Processed advertisement data may include grouped blocks of advertisement data such as one or more blocks of website specific advertisement data. Website specific advertisement data may include site specific header information one or more site specific data trees and ad block specific summary data associated with each advertisement block on the selected website.

At step site specific header information one or more site specific data trees and ad block specific summary data for the selected website may be generated.

Site specific header information may include a URL of the website and access time that the website was explored.

Site specific data trees may include identified pathways for identified content on the selected website represented a base URL with branches sub branches etc. that indicate pathways of placement for the content e.g. cascading style sheet CSS files JavaScript JS files URLs and images e.g. joint photographic experts group JPEG and portable network graphics PNG files in each branch sub branch etc.

Ad block specific summary data may include advertisement block data for each advertisement on a publisher website. Advertisement block data for each advertisement block may include an advertiser name advertisement file information e.g. the file size pixel dimensions or file type of a given creative creative files e.g. a copy a creative image video animation file itself landing pages e.g. an advertiser webpage URL or URL of a webpage that sells the products being advertised and page location e.g. the pixel coordinates at which creatines are displayed of the advertisements.

If desired some or all of the site specific advertisement data may be mapped to a customer friendly name such as a name of an advertising company using a predetermined set of name mapping rules. For example an advertiser associated with a website with a URL of www.advertiser1.com may be associated with a customer friendly name of ADVERTISER. If desired each HTTP request may be mapped to a customer friendly name corresponding to an associated service.

Steps and may be performed using advertisement discover equipment of system of and or cookie harvesting computing equipment of system of if desired .

At step processed advertisement data may be provided from for example advertising discovery equipment to for example data analysis and storage equipment .

At step the data analysis and storage equipment may be used to accumulate and aggregate the received processed advertisement data to form aggregated advertisement data. Aggregated advertisement data may include may include data that has been sorted and combined based upon various criteria. As examples aggregated advertisement data may include per site data per service data per ad network data per advertiser data per creative data and or per campaign data.

Per site data may include processed and aggregated advertisement data that has been sorted and combined by publisher website. Per service data may include processed and aggregated advertisement data that has been sorted and combined by advertising service e.g. advertising networks or advertising exchanges . Per ad network data may include processed and aggregated advertisement data that has been sorted and combined by advertising network. Per advertiser data may include processed and aggregated advertisement data that has been sorted and combined by advertiser. Per creative data may include processed and aggregated advertisement data that has been sorted and combined by advertising creative. Per campaign data may include processed and aggregated advertisement data that has been grouped by advertising campaign. An advertising campaign may include multiple advertisement creatines for a portion of an advertiser s products e.g. a campaign for trucks made by an automaker .

At step computing equipment such as customer interface equipment may be used to provide access to the aggregated advertisement data e.g. by sending an email to a customer with some or all of the aggregated advertisement data updating a customer accessible portion of a web server etc. .

If desired system may be used to generate and maintain user profile cookie sets for user profiles that are specific to selected geographical locations. System may generate and maintain a user profile cookie set for a user profile that is specific to a particular geographical location by loading websites as described above in connection with step of or step of using computing equipment e.g. proxy servers or other computing equipment that is located in that geographical location. However this is merely illustrative. If desired system may generate and maintain a user profile cookie set for a user profile that is specific to a selected geographical location by selecting sets of websites to browse at least in part by the percentage of users of that website that are located in that particular geographical region.

In this way cookies sets may be generated that indicate to a publisher website that a simulated user lives in primarily browses the internet from or primarily browses websites associated with a particular geographical region.

For example for a user profile associated with a particular city a cookie set may be generated that includes cookies associated with websites of the newspaper the sports team the government offices or other businesses vendors or publishers associated with that particular city.

System may generate and maintain user profile cookie sets for user profiles that are associated with a selected geographical location using user trait sets and site specific user segmentation data that include geographical information.

As shown in user trait set may include geographical location data in a user trait . For example geographical location data may indicate the country state city region continent or other geographical location at which the user lives from which the user primarily browses publisher web pages or with which the publishers of web pages the user typically browses are associated.

As shown in site specific segmentation data may include geographical location data such as a site specific user population geographical location statistic that indicates the percentages of users of a selected website associated with a URL that access the website from various geographical locations. In the example of the first URL URL has associated URL USER POPULATION GENDER statistics URL USER POPULATION AGE statistics URL USER POPULATION INCOME statistics and URL USER GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION statistics e.g. 20 southwest U.S. 23 northeast U.S. 17 California 15 Los Angeles etc. .

System may use user trait sets and site specific user segmentation data of the types shown in when selecting sets of websites as described above in connection with step of or when selecting user profiles as described above in connection with step of .

Illustrative steps that may be used in selecting sets of websites using geographical location information are shown in .

At step user population percentages including user population geographical location percentages for users of a plurality of websites e.g. the percentage of users that are located in or primarily browse from Los Angeles and New York City may be extracted from the obtained site specific segmentation data obtained at step of .

At step the extracted user population percentages may be compared to user traits that include a user geographical location such as geographical location data of of the selected user profile.

At step a probability may be assigned to each of the plurality of websites based on the comparison of the extracted user population percentages and user trait set that include the geographical location data. For example the selected user profile may have a user trait of a female with an income of 44 000 per year that primarily accesses the internet from California. The user population percentages of a particular one of the plurality of websites may indicate for example that 30 of the website s users are female that 40 of the website s users have an income range of 40 000 50 000 and that 80 of the website s users access the website from California. System may then assign a gender probability factor of 0.3 an income probability factor of 0.4 to that user profile and a geographical location probability factor of 0.9 to that website.

System may then combine the gender probability factor the income probability factor the geographical location probability factor and other probability factors based on other user traits and user population percentages into a probability for that website. In the current example the website probability may be computed as the product of the individual probability factors e.g. website probability factor 0.3 0.4 0.9 . However this is merely illustrative. Probability factors associated with any user traits and any user population percentages may be combined in any suitable way to generate a website probability for each website.

At step the set of websites may be probabilistically selected based on the assigned probabilities of the plurality of websites.

Illustrative steps that may be used in selecting user profiles using geographical location information are shown in .

At step user population percentages including user geographical location percentages such as the percentage of users of the selected website that are located in or primarily browse from Los Angeles and the percentage of users of the selected website that are located in or primarily browse from New York City as examples may be extracted from the obtained site specific segmentation data obtained at step of .

At step the extracted user population percentages may be compared to user traits that include a user geographical location such as geographical location data of in the user trait set of each user profile in the user profile database.

At step a probability may be assigned to each user profile in the user profile database based on the comparison of the extracted user population percentages and the user trait sets that include the geographical location data. For example a user profile may have a user trait of a female with an income of 44 000 per year that primarily accesses the internet from California. The user population percentages may indicate for example that 30 of the selected website s users are female that 40 of the selected website s users have an income range of 40 000 50 000 and that 80 of the selected website s users access the website from California. System may then assign a gender probability factor of 0.3 an income probability factor of 0.4 to that user profile and a geographical location probability factor of 0.9 to that user profile.

System may then combine the gender probability factor the income probability factor the geographical location probability factor and other probability factors based on other user traits and user population percentages into a probability for that user profile. In the current example the user profile probability may be computed as the product of the individual probability factors e.g. user profile probability factor 0.3 0.4 0.9 . However this is merely illustrative. Probability factors associated with any user traits and any user population percentages may be combined in any suitable way to generate a user profile probability for each user profile.

At step a user profile may be probabilistically selected based on the assigned probabilities of the user profiles as described above in connection with step of .

The foregoing is merely illustrative of the principles of this invention and various modifications can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.
