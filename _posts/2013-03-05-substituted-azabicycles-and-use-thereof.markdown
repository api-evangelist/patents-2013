The present application relates to novel substituted azabicycles to processes for their preparation to their use alone or in combinations for the treatment and or prophylaxis of diseases and to their use for producing medicaments for the treatment and or prophylaxis of diseases in particular for the treatment and or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders.

One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate cGMP . Together with nitrogen monoxide NO which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals it forms the NO cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyse the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate GTP . The representatives of this family known to date can be divided into two groups either according to structural features or according to the type of ligands the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one haem per heterodimer which is part of the regulatory centre. This is of central importance for the activation mechanism. NO can bind to the iron atom of haem and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Haem free preparations cannot by contrast be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide CO is also able to bind to the central iron atom of haem but the stimulation by CO is much less than that by NO.

By forming cGMP and owing to the resulting regulation of phosphodiesterases ion channels and protein kinases guanylate cyclase plays an important role in various physiological processes in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells in platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission and also in disorders which are based on a disruption of the aforementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions the NO cGMP system can be suppressed which can lead for example to hypertension platelet activation increased cell proliferation endothelial dysfunction arteriosclerosis angina pectoris heart failure myocardial infarction thromboses stroke and sexual dysfunction.

Owing to the expected high efficiency and low level of side effects a possible NO independent treatment for such disorders by targeting the influence of the cGMP signal pathway in organisms is a promising approach.

Hitherto for the therapeutic stimulation of the soluble guanylate cyclase use has exclusively been made of compounds such as organic nitrates whose effect is based on NO. The latter is formed by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attack at the central iron atom of haem.

In addition to the side effects the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment.

In recent years some substances have been described which stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase directly i.e. without prior release of NO such as for example 3 5 hydroxymethyl 2 furyl 1 benzylindazole YC 1 Wu et al. 84 1994 4226 M lsch et al. 120 1997 681 fatty acids Goldberg et al. 252 1977 1279 diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate Pettibone et al. 116 1985 307 isoliquiritigenin Yu et al. 114 1995 1587 and various substituted pyrazole derivatives WO 98 16223 .

As stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase WO 00 06569 discloses fused pyrazole derivatives and WO 01 083490 a fused aminopyridine derivative. WO 2010 065275 discloses pyrrolopyrimidones as activators of soluble guanylate cyclase.

It was an object of the present invention to provide novel substances which act as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase and which have an identical or improved therapeutic profile compared to the compounds known from the prior art for example with respect to their in vivo properties such as their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behaviour and or their metabolic profile and or their dose effect relationship.

The pharmacological effect of the compounds according to the invention can be shown in the following assays 

Rabbits are stunned by a blow to the neck and exsanguinated. The aorta is removed freed from adhering tissue and divided into rings of a width of 1.5 mm. The rings are placed individually under an initial tension in 5 ml organ baths with Krebs Henseleit solution which is at 37 C. is gassed with carbogen and has the following composition in each case mM sodium chloride 119 potassium chloride 4.8 calcium chloride dihydrate 1 magnesium sulphate heptahydrate 1.4 potassium dihydrogenphosphate 1.2 sodium bicarbonate 25 glucose 10. The contractile force is determined with Statham UC2 cells amplified and digitalized using A D transducers DAS 1802 HC Keithley Instruments Munich and recorded in parallel on linear recorders. To produce a contraction phenylephrine is added to the bath cumulatively in increasing concentration. After several control cycles the substance to be investigated is added in each further run in increasing dosage in each case and the height of the contraction achieved is compared with the height of the contraction reached in the last preceding run. This is used to calculate the concentration needed to reduce the magnitude of the control value by 50 ICvalue . The standard administration volume is 5 l the DMSO content in the bath solution corresponds to 0.1 .

Representative values MEC minimum effective concentration for the compounds according to the invention are shown in the table below Table 2 

A commercially available telemetry system from DATA SCIENCES INTERNATIONAL DSI USA is employed for the blood pressure measurement on conscious rats described below.

The telemetry system makes it possible to continuously record blood pressure heart rate and body motion of conscious animals in their usual habitat.

The investigations are carried out on adult female spontaneously hypertensive rats SHR Okamoto with a body weight of 200 g. SHR NCrl from the Okamoto Kyoto School of Medicine 1963 were a cross of male Wistar Kyoto rats with highly elevated blood pressure and female rats having a slightly elevated blood pressure and at F13 handed over to the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

After transmitter implantation the experimental animals are housed singly in type 3 Makrolon cages. They have free access to standard feed and water.

The day night rhythm in the experimental laboratory is changed by the room lighting at 6 00 am and at 7 00 pm.

The telemetry transmitters TA11 PA C40 used are surgically implanted under aseptic conditions in the experimental animals at least 14 days before the first experimental use. The animals instrumented in this way can be employed repeatedly after the wound has healed and the implant has settled.

For the implantation the fasted animals are anaesthetized with pentobarbital Nembutal Sanofi 50 mg kg i.p. and shaved and disinfected over a large area of their abdomens. After the abdominal cavity has been opened along the linea alba the liquid filled measuring catheter of the system is inserted into the descending aorta in the cranial direction above the bifurcation and fixed with tissue glue VetBonD 3M . The transmitter housing is fixed intraperitoneally to the abdominal wall muscle and layered closure of the wound is performed.

An antibiotic Tardomyocel COMP Bayer 1 ml kg s.c. is administered postoperatively for prophylaxis of infection.

Unless indicated otherwise the substances to be investigated are administered orally by gavage in each case to a group of animals n 6 . The test substances are dissolved in suitable solvent mixtures or suspended in 0.5 strength Tylose appropriate for an administration volume of 5 ml kg of body weight.

The telemetry measuring unit present is configured for 24 animals. Each experiment is recorded under an experiment number Vyear month day .

Each of the instrumented rats living in the system is assigned a separate receiving antenna 1010 Receiver DSI .

The implanted transmitters can be activated externally by means of an incorporated magnetic switch. They are switched to transmission in the run up to the experiment. The signals emitted can be detected online by a data acquisition system Dataquest A.R.T. for WINDOWS DSI and processed accordingly. The data are stored in each case in a file created for this purpose and bearing the experiment number.

The acquisition of measurements is repeated under computer control at 5 minute intervals. The source data obtained as absolute value are corrected in the diagram with the currently measured barometric pressure Ambient Pressure Reference Monitor APR 1 and stored as individual data. Further technical details are given in the extensive documentation from the manufacturing company DSI .

Unless indicated otherwise the test substances are administered at 9 00 am on the day of the experiment. Following the administration the parameters described above are measured over 24 hours.

After the end of the experiment the acquired individual data are sorted using the analysis software DATAQUEST A.R.T. ANALYSIS . The blank value is assumed to be the time 2 hours before administration and so the selected data set encompasses the period from 7 00 am on the day of the experiment to 9 00 am on the following day.

The data are smoothed over a presettable time by determination of the average 15 minute average and transferred as a text file to a storage medium. The measured values presorted and compressed in this way are transferred into Excel templates and tabulated. For each day of the experiment the data obtained are stored in a dedicated file bearing the number of the experiment. Results and test protocols are filed in paper form sorted by numbers.

The pharmacokinetic parameters of the compounds according to the invention are determined in male CD 1 mice male Wistar rats and female beagles. Intravenous administration in the case of mice and rats is effected by means of a species specific plasma DMSO formulation and in the case of dogs by means of a water PEG400 ethanol formulation. In all species oral administration of the dissolved substance is performed via gavage based on a water PEG400 ethanol formulation. The removal of blood from rats is simplified by inserting a silicone catheter into the right Vena jugularis externa prior to substance administration. The operation is effected at least one day prior to the experiment with isofluran anaesthesia and administration of an analgesic atropine rimadyl 3 1 0.1 ml s.c. . The blood is taken generally more than 10 time points within a time window including terminal time points of at least 24 to a maximum of 72 hours after substance administration. The blood is removed into heparinized tubes. The blood plasma is then obtained by centrifugation if required it can be stored at 20 C. until further processing.

An internal standard which may also be a chemically unrelated substance is added to the samples of the compounds according to the invention calibration samples and qualifiers and there follows protein precipitation by means of acetonitrile in excess. Addition of a buffer solution matched to the LC conditions and subsequent vortexing is followed by centrifugation at 1000 g. The supernatant is analysed by means of LC MS MS using C18 reversed phase columns and variable mobile phase mixtures. The substances are quantified via the peak heights or areas from extracted ion chromatograms of specific selected ion monitoring experiments.

The plasma concentration time plots determined are used to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters such as AUC C t terminal half life MRT mean residence time and CL clearance using a validated pharmacokinetic calculation program.

Since the substance quantification is performed in plasma it is necessary to determine the blood plasma distribution of the substance in order to be able to adjust the pharmacokinetic parameters correspondingly. For this purpose a defined amount of substance is incubated in heparinized whole blood of the species in question in a rocking roller mixer for 20 min. After centrifugation at 1000 g the plasma concentration is measured by means of LC MS MS see above and determined by calculating the ratio of the c cvalue.

The compounds according to the invention were incubated with a concentration of about 0.1 10 M. To this end stock solutions of the compounds according to the invention having a concentration of 0.01 1 mM in acetonitrile were prepared and then pipetted with 1 100 dilution into the incubation mixture. Liver microsomes and recombinant enzymes were incubated at 37 C. in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 with and without NADPH generating system consisting of 1 mM NADP 10 mM glucose 6 phosphate and 1 unit glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase. Primary hepatocytes were incubated in suspension in Williams E medium likewise at 37 C. After an incubation time of 0 4 h the incubation mixtures were stopped with acetonitrile final concentration about 30 and the protein was centrifuged off at about 15 000 g. The samples thus stopped were either analysed directly or stored at 20 C. until analysis.

The analysis is effected by means of high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet and mass spectrometry detection HPLC UV MS MS . To this end the supernatants of the incubation samples are chromatographed with suitable C18 reversed phase columns and variable mobile phase mixtures of acetonitrile and 10 mM aqueous ammonium formate solution or 0.05 formic acid. The UV chromatograms in conjunction with mass spectrometry data serve for identification structural elucidation and quantitative estimation of the metabolites and for quantitative metabolic reduction of the compound according to the invention in the incubation mixtures.
