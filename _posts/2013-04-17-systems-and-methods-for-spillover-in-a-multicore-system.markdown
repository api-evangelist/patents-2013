title: Systems and methods for spillover in a multi-core system
abstract: The present invention is directed towards systems and methods for spillover threshold management in a multi-core system. A pool manager divides the spillover threshold limit of connections for vServers into an exclusive quota pool and a shared quota pool. Each vServer operating on a core is allocated an exclusive number of connections from the exclusive quota pool. If a vServer wishes to create connections beyond its exclusive number, the vServer can borrow from the shared quota pool. When the vServers are using at least a first predetermined threshold of their exclusive number of connections and the number of available connections in the shared quota pool has reached a second predetermined threshold, the multi-core system establishes a backup vServer.

The present application claims priority to and is a continuation of U.S. Non Provisional application Ser. No. 12 820 607 entitled Systems and Methods for Spillover in a Multi Core System and filed on Jun. 22 2010 which in turn claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 219 223 entitled Systems and Methods for Spillover in a Multi Core System and filed Jun. 22 2009 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.

The present application generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present application relates to systems and methods for spillover in a multi core system.

As any server virtual or physical possesses finite capacity the number of connections to a server over a network will be subject to inherent or imposed limits. In a single processor system the processor may field all of these requests to create connections. The processor may process multiple connections in parallel according to the processor s own capacity. As the number of requests for service exhaust a processor s capacity the system may establish a spillover system to service additional requests. In a multi core system requests to create connections may be handled by different cores at different times. Each of the cores may be running at different capacity. It is challenging to manage the connections across the different cores as the cores reach their capacity and require spillover support.

The present application is directed towards handling spillover in a multi core system. In general overview a spillover threshold for numbers of uses of a resource is established for the virtual servers of a multi core system. A pool manager divides the spillover threshold into an exclusive quota pool and a shared quota pool. Further the pool manager allocates to each virtual server its exclusive number of uses of a resource. When a virtual server exhausts its exclusive number of uses the virtual server may borrow uses from the shared quota pool. Depending on the level of resource use by individual virtual servers and the remaining uses in the shared quota pool the multi core system may establish a backup virtual server. Then additional requests for service may be directed to the backup virtual server.

In one aspect the present disclosure is directed to a method of managing spillover for virtual servers across a plurality of cores in a multi core system. The method includes receiving a request from a client for a service managed by the multi core system. The method also includes determining that a first virtual server operating on a first core of the multi core system is using at least a first predetermined threshold number of its exclusive number of uses of a resource the exclusive number of uses allocated from an exclusive quota pool and based on a spillover threshold. The method also includes determining that a number of available uses of the resource in a shared quota pool has reached a second predetermined threshold the shared quota pool based on the spillover threshold. The method also includes establishing a backup virtual server. The method also includes forwarding the request for the service to the backup virtual server.

The first predetermined threshold may be equal to the exclusive number of uses of the first virtual server. The second predetermined threshold may be zero. The method may include determining that the first virtual server is using at least a first predetermined threshold number of connections to services and determining that the number of available uses has reached a second predetermined threshold number of connections to services.

The method may include determining that the first virtual server is using at least a first predetermined threshold amount of bandwidth and determining that an amount of available bandwidth in the shared quota pool has reached a second predetermined threshold amount of bandwidth. The method may include establishing a backup virtual server on a core of the multi core system. The method may include establishing a backup virtual server on a core of a second multi core system.

The method may also include monitoring a status for each of a plurality of services managed by the multi core system determining a status of a service of the plurality of services indicates the service is not available and adjusting in response to the determination the spillover threshold to comprise a sum of resource capacities for each of the plurality of services having a status of available. The method may also include adjusting the exclusive quota pool according to the adjusted spillover threshold adjusting the exclusive number of uses of resources allocated to the first virtual server according to the adjusted spillover threshold and adjusting the shared quota pool according to the adjusted spillover threshold. The method may also include determining a number of uses of resources for the multi core system has fallen below the spillover threshold receiving a second request for a service managed by the multi core system from a second client and providing the second request to the first virtual server on the multi core system.

In another aspect the present disclosure is directed to a multi core system for managing spillover for virtual servers across a plurality of cores in a multi core system. The multi core system includes a transceiver that receives a request from a client for a service managed by the multi core system. The multi core system also includes a pool manager that determines that a first virtual server operating on a first core of the multi core system is using at least a first predetermined threshold number of its exclusive number of uses of a resource the exclusive number of uses allocated from an exclusive quota pool and based on a spillover threshold and determines that a number of available uses of the resource in a shared quota pool has reached a second predetermined threshold the shared quota pool based on the spillover threshold. The multi core system also includes a management component that establishes a backup virtual server. The multi core system also includes a connection management mechanism that forwards the request for the service to the backup virtual server.

The pool manager may determine that the first virtual server is using at least a first predetermined threshold number of connections to services and determine that the number of available uses has reached a second predetermined threshold number of connections to services. The pool manager may determine that the first virtual server is using at least a first predetermined threshold amount of bandwidth and determine that an amount of available bandwidth in the shared quota pool has reached a second predetermined threshold amount of bandwidth.

The management component may establish the backup virtual server on a core of the multi core system. The management component may establish the backup virtual server on a core of a second multi core system.

In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to data parallelism can comprise distributing an amount of work based on distributing data associated with a particular hardware or software component. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to flow based data parallelism can comprise distributing data based on a context or flow such that the amount of work A N on each core may be similar substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed.

In the case of the functional parallelism approach each core may be configured to run one or more functionalities of the plurality of functionalities provided by the packet engine or VIP of the appliance. For example core 1 may perform network I O processing for the appliance while core 2 performs TCP connection management for the appliance. Likewise core 3 may perform SSL offloading while core 4 may perform layer 7 or application layer processing and traffic management. Each of the cores may perform the same function or different functions. Each of the cores may perform more than one function. Any of the cores may run any of the functionality or portions thereof identified and or described in conjunction with . In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of performance or load .

In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of load or performance.

The functionality or tasks may be distributed in any arrangement and scheme. For example illustrates a first core Core 1 A processing applications and processes associated with network I O functionality A. Network traffic associated with network I O in some embodiments can be associated with a particular port number. Thus outgoing and incoming packets having a port destination associated with NW I O A will be directed towards Core 1 A which is dedicated to handling all network traffic associated with the NW I O port. Similarly Core 2 B is dedicated to handling functionality associated with SSL processing and Core 4 D may be dedicated handling all TCP level processing and functionality.

While illustrates functions such as network I O SSL and TCP other functions can be assigned to cores. These other functions can include any one or more of the functions or operations described herein. For example any of the functions described in conjunction with may be distributed across the cores on a functionality basis. In some cases a first VIP A may run on a first core while a second VIP B with a different configuration may run on a second core. In some embodiments each core can handle a particular functionality such that each core can handle the processing associated with that particular function. For example Core 2 B may handle SSL offloading while Core 4 D may handle application layer processing and traffic management.

In other embodiments work load or network traffic may be distributed among cores according to any type and form of data parallelism . In some embodiments data parallelism may be achieved in a multi core system by each core performing the same task or functionally on different pieces of distributed data. In some embodiments a single execution thread or code controls operations on all pieces of data. In other embodiments different threads or instructions control the operation but may execute the same code. In some embodiments data parallelism is achieved from the perspective of a packet engine vServers VIPs A C network interface cards NIC D E and or any other networking hardware or software included on or associated with an appliance . For example each core may run the same packet engine or VIP code or configuration but operate on different sets of distributed data. Each networking hardware or software construct can receive different varying or substantially the same amount of data and as a result may have varying different or relatively the same amount of load .

In the case of a data parallelism approach the work may be divided up and distributed based on VIPs NICs and or data flows of the VIPs or NICs. In one of these approaches the work of the multi core system may be divided or distributed among the VIPs by having each VIP work on a distributed set of data. For example each core may be configured to run one or more VIPs. Network traffic may be distributed to the core for each VIP handling that traffic. In another of these approaches the work of the appliance may be divided or distributed among the cores based on which NIC receives the network traffic. For example network traffic of a first NIC may be distributed to a first core while network traffic of a second NIC may be distributed to a second core. In some cases a core may process data from multiple NICs.

While illustrates a single vServer associated with a single core as is the case for VIP1 A VIP2 B and VIP3 C. In some embodiments a single vServer can be associated with one or more cores . In contrast one or more vServers can be associated with a single core . Associating a vServer with a core may include that core to process all functions associated with that particular vServer. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code and configuration. In other embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code but different configuration. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having different code and the same or different configuration.

Like vServers NICs can also be associated with particular cores . In many embodiments NICs can be connected to one or more cores such that when a NIC receives or transmits data packets a particular core handles the processing involved with receiving and transmitting the data packets. In one embodiment a single NIC can be associated with a single core as is the case with NIC1 D and NIC2 E. In other embodiments one or more NICs can be associated with a single core . In other embodiments a single NIC can be associated with one or more cores . In these embodiments load could be distributed amongst the one or more cores such that each core processes a substantially similar amount of load. A core associated with a NIC may process all functions and or data associated with that particular NIC.

While distributing work across cores based on data of VIPs or NICs may have a level of independency in some embodiments this may lead to unbalanced use of cores as illustrated by the varying loads of .

In some embodiments load work or network traffic can be distributed among cores based on any type and form of data flow. In another of these approaches the work may be divided or distributed among cores based on data flows. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approaches.

In flow based data parallelism distribution of data is related to any type of flow of data such as request response pairings transactions sessions connections or application communications. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. The distribution of data flow may be such that each core carries a substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed amount of load data or network traffic.

In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approached. In one embodiment data flow can be distributed based on a transaction or a series of transactions. This transaction in some embodiments can be between a client and a server and can be characterized by an IP address or other packet identifier. For example Core 1 A can be dedicated to transactions between a particular client and a particular server therefore the load A on Core 1 A may be comprised of the network traffic associated with the transactions between the particular client and server. Allocating the network traffic to Core 1 A can be accomplished by routing all data packets originating from either the particular client or server to Core 1 A.

While work or load can be distributed to the cores based in part on transactions in other embodiments load or work can be allocated on a per packet basis. In these embodiments the appliance can intercept data packets and allocate them to a core having the least amount of load. For example the appliance could allocate a first incoming data packet to Core 1 A because the load A on Core 1 is less than the load B N on the rest of the cores B N. Once the first data packet is allocated to Core 1 A the amount of load A on Core 1 A is increased proportional to the amount of processing resources needed to process the first data packet. When the appliance intercepts a second data packet the appliance will allocate the load to Core 4 D because Core 4 D has the second least amount of load. Allocating data packets to the core with the least amount of load can in some embodiments ensure that the load A N distributed to each core remains substantially equal.

In other embodiments load can be allocated on a per unit basis where a section of network traffic is allocated to a particular core . The above mentioned example illustrates load balancing on a per packet basis. In other embodiments load can be allocated based on a number of packets such that every 10 100 or 1000 packets are allocated to the core having the least amount of load. The number of packets allocated to a core can be a number determined by an application user or administrator and can be any number greater than zero. In still other embodiments load can be allocated based on a time metric such that packets are distributed to a particular core for a predetermined amount of time. In these embodiments packets can be distributed to a particular core for five milliseconds or for any period of time determined by a user program system administrator or otherwise. After the predetermined time period elapses data packets are transmitted to a different core for the predetermined period of time.

Flow based data parallelism methods for distributing work load or network traffic among the one or more cores can comprise any combination of the above mentioned embodiments. These methods can be carried out by any part of the appliance by an application or set of executable instructions executing on one of the cores such as the packet engine or by any application program or agent executing on a computing device in communication with the appliance .

The functional and data parallelism computing schemes illustrated in can be combined in any manner to generate a hybrid parallelism or distributed processing scheme that encompasses function parallelism data parallelism flow based data parallelism or any portions thereof. In some cases the multi core system may use any type and form of load balancing schemes to distribute load among the one or more cores . The load balancing scheme may be used in any combination with any of the functional and data parallelism schemes or combinations thereof.

The packet engine s A N can in some embodiments be associated with a particular server user client or network. When a packet engine becomes associated with a particular entity that packet engine can process data packets associated with that entity. For example should a packet engine be associated with a first user that packet engine will process and operate on packets generated by the first user or packets having a destination address associated with the first user. Similarly the packet engine may choose not to be associated with a particular entity such that the packet engine can process and otherwise operate on any data packets not generated by that entity or destined for that entity.

The flow distributors can comprise an interface mechanism that allows each flow distributor to communicate with the other flow distributors executing within the system . In one instance the one or more flow distributors can determine how to balance load by communicating with each other. This process can operate substantially similarly to the process described above for submitting votes to an arbiter which then determines which flow distributor should receive the load. In other embodiments a first flow distributor can identify the load on an associated core and determine whether to forward a first data packet to the associated core based on any of the following criteria the load on the associated core is above a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is below a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is less than the load on the other cores or any other metric that can be used to determine where to forward data packets based in part on the amount of load on a processor.

There exist situations where a response to a request packet may not be processed by the same core i.e. the first core processes the request while the second core processes the response. In these situations the instances of the flow distributor can intercept the packet and forward it to the desired or correct core i.e. a flow distributor instance can forward the response to the first core. Multiple instances of the flow distributor can execute on any number of cores and any combination of cores .

The flow distributor may operate responsive to any one or more rules or policies. The rules may identify a core or packet processing engine to receive a network packet data or data flow.

The other cores may be secondary cores which operate in a data plane while the control core provides the control plane. The cores A N may share a global cache . While the control core provides a control plane the other cores in the multi core system form or provide a data plane. These cores perform data processing functionality on network traffic while the control provides initialization configuration and control of the multi core system.

Any portion of the memory of each of the cores may be allocated to or used for a global cache that is shared by the cores. In brief overview a predetermined percentage or predetermined amount of each of the memory of each core may be used for the global cache. For example 50 of each memory of each code may be dedicated or allocated to the shared global cache. That is in the illustrated embodiment 2 GB of each core excluding the control plane core or core 1 may be used to form a 28 GB shared global cache. The configuration of the control plane such as via the configuration services may determine the amount of memory used for the shared global cache. In some embodiments each core may provide a different amount of memory for use by the global cache. In other embodiments any one core may not provide any memory or use the global cache. In some embodiments any of the cores may also have a local cache in memory not allocated to the global shared memory. Each of the cores may store any portion of network traffic to the global shared cache. Each of the cores may check the cache for any content to use in a request or response. Any of the cores may obtain content from the global shared cache to use in a data flow request or response.

The global cache can be any type and form of memory or storage element such as any memory or storage element described herein. In some embodiments the cores may have access to a predetermined amount of memory i.e. 32 GB or any other memory amount commensurate with the system . The global cache can be allocated from that predetermined amount of memory while the rest of the available memory can be allocated among the cores . In other embodiments each core can have a predetermined amount of memory. The global cache can comprise an amount of the memory allocated to each core . This memory amount can be measured in bytes or can be measured as a percentage of the memory allocated to each core . Thus the global cache can comprise 1 GB of memory from the memory associated with each core or can comprise 20 percent or one half of the memory associated with each core . In some embodiments only a portion of the cores provide memory to the global cache while in other embodiments the global cache can comprise memory not allocated to the cores .

Each core can use the global cache to store network traffic or cache data. In some embodiments the packet engines of the core use the global cache to cache and use data stored by the plurality of packet engines. For example the cache manager of and cache functionality of may use the global cache to share data for acceleration. For example each of the packet engines may store responses such as HTML data to the global cache. Any of the cache managers operating on a core may access the global cache to server caches responses to client requests.

In some embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store a port allocation table which can be used to determine data flow based in part on ports. In other embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store an address lookup table or any other table or list that can be used by the flow distributor to determine where to direct incoming and outgoing data packets. The cores can in some embodiments read from and write to cache while in other embodiments the cores can only read from or write to cache .

For example one core can control deciding which distribution scheme to use while another core can determine the size of the global cache .

The control plane of the multi core system may be the designation and configuration of a core as the dedicated management core or as a master core. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of operation and functionality the plurality of cores in the multi core system. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of allocation and use of memory of the system among the plurality of cores in the multi core system including initialization and configuration of the same. In some embodiments the control plane includes the flow distributor for controlling the assignment of data flows to cores and the distribution of network packets to cores based on data flows. In some embodiments the control plane core runs a packet engine and in other embodiments the control plane core is dedicated to management and control of the other cores of the system.

The control core A can exercise a level of control over the other cores such as determining how much memory should be allocated to each core or determining which core should be assigned to handle a particular function or hardware software entity. The control core A in some embodiments can exercise control over those cores within the control plan . Thus there can exist processors outside of the control plane which are not controlled by the control core A. Determining the boundaries of the control plane can include maintaining by the control core A or agent executing within the system a list of those cores controlled by the control core A. The control core A can control any of the following initialization of a core determining when a core is unavailable re distributing load to other cores when one core fails determining which distribution scheme to implement determining which core should receive network traffic determining how much cache should be allocated to each core determining whether to assign a particular function or element to a particular core determining whether to permit cores to communicate with one another determining the size of the global cache and any other determination of a function configuration or operation of the cores within the system .

The systems and methods of the solution described herein are directed towards managing spillover for virtual servers also referred to herein as vServers across a plurality of cores in a multi core system. Spillover is a means by which new connections to vServers executing on an appliance are diverted to backup vServers. The connections may be diverted when a parameter of a vServer parameters of multiple vServers or parameters of an entire appliance exceed one or more spillover related thresholds.

For example new connections may be diverted to backup vServers when the number of connections to a vServer or the appliance exceeds a connection threshold. The spillover can either be connection based or dynamic. Connection based spillover allows one to explicitly set a threshold limit for a vServer or an appliance . The threshold limit may correspond either to the number of active connections or SSL sessions. When this threshold limit is exceeded every new client connection is diverted to the backup vServer. Dynamic spillover depends on the maximum client setting of the services bound to a vServer or all the vServers on the appliance . If the number of client connections at the vServer or all the vServers on the appliance exceeds the sum of the values on all the active services all additional connections are diverted to the backup vServer.

A pool management system may be used to handle limits for spillover conditions or otherwise spillover thresholds for vServers in a multi core system. Generally a spillover threshold will be described in terms of a connection threshold but any type and form of spillover threshold may be used. The spillover threshold may relate to any number of uses of a resource such as numbers of connections to services or bandwidth. In brief overview a pool manager allocates a threshold number of connections for spillover which may be a maximum dynamic connection threshold to a plurality of vServers operating on a plurality of packet processing engines on a plurality of cores of a multi core system. The pool manager divides the limited number of connections into an exclusive quota pool and a shared quota pool. The pool manager allocates to each vServer an exclusive number of connections wherein each exclusive number may be taken from the exclusive quota pool. Each vServer may have up to its exclusive number of connections.

If a vServer wishes to increase its number of connections beyond its exclusive number the vServer may request to the pool manager to borrow connections from the shared quota pool. The pool manager may grant the vServer a batch number of connections from the shared quota pool. When the vServer completes the use of one or more connections the vServer may return borrowed connections also referred to herein as quota to the shared quota pool. As a result a limited number of connections to a vServers may be distributed across a plurality of cores on a multi core system.

Referring now to an embodiment of a system for providing management of transport layer connections via an appliance using a dynamic maximum connection threshold is depicted. In brief overview the appliance establishes a first vServer A to load balance a plurality of clients access to one or more services A N of a first set of servers A N. The appliance includes a connection management mechanism for managing and balancing transport layer connection requests from clients to one or more set of services A N. The appliance establishes for the first vServer A a maximum dynamic connection threshold A based on the sum of the connection capacity A N each of the services A N are targeted or configured to handle. Via monitoring agents A N from the multi core system the appliance monitors the operational status of each of the services A N. If any of the services A N have a change in status from available to not available or not available to available the appliance adjusts the dynamic maximum connection threshold A by including or not including the corresponding connection capacity A B of the service in the summation of the threshold. For example if the appliance detects a first service A has a status of not available the appliance subtracts the connection capacity A of the first service A from the maximum dynamic connection threshold A. As such the appliance dynamically adjusts the maximum connection threshold for a vServer in real time in accordance with the monitored status of the services A N and each service s corresponding connection capacity A N. If the number of client connections at the vServer exceeds the dynamic connection threshold A the connection management mechanism directs new requests for connections to backup vServers.

In further detail the connection management mechanism comprises software hardware or any combination of software and hardware having logic functions or operations for receiving and managing connection requests and communications from one or more clients A N. In one embodiment the connection management mechanism receives or intercepts transport layer connection requests and communications between the clients A N and one or more services A N. The connection management mechanism may include an application program service process task thread or any type and form of executable instructions. In another embodiment the connection management mechanism identifies determines or selects a vServer for processing a received communication from a client .

In some embodiments the connection management mechanism determines if the dynamic maximum connection threshold has been reached or exceeded. The connection management mechanism determines if the dynamic maximum connection threshold is exceeded and whether or not to establish a backup or second vServer N e.g. a spillover vServer. Upon detecting the number of active transport layer connections of the first vServer A exceeds the dynamically adjusted maximum connection threshold the connection management mechanism may direct transfer or otherwise provide a received transport layer connection request of a client to the second vServer N for handling. By using the dynamically adjusted maximum connection threshold the connection management mechanism dynamically and automatically spillovers connection requests from clients from a first vServer A to a backup or second vServer N.

In other embodiments the connection management mechanism may maintain connection or session persistence between a client and the vServer A N handling requests for the client . In some embodiments the connection management mechanism selects the spillover vServer N for handling a client request even though the number of active connections of the first vServer A does not exceed its allocated number of connections. In other embodiments the connection management mechanism selects the first vServer A for handling a client request event though requests from other clients are directed to the spillover vServer N. In one embodiment the connection management mechanism may select the first vServer A or backup vServer N based on which vServer most recently handled a request from the client .

Upon detecting the dynamically adjusted maximum connection threshold has been exceeded for the first vServer A and or the second vServer N the connection management mechanism in one embodiment may determine not to establish another spillover vServer N but instead redirects the client directly to a server or otherwise to bypass the appliance . For example the connection management mechanism may determine the dynamically adjusted maximum connection threshold B for the spillover vServer N has been reached and may redirect the client to bypass the appliance instead of establishing a third vServer N for spillover. In these embodiments the connection management mechanism may transmit a redirect Uniform Resource Locator URL to the client for the client to connect to in response to the client s connection request. The URL may identify any one of the servers or services .

In yet another embodiment the appliance and or connection management mechanism manages the number of active connections and performs dynamic spillover techniques for a plurality of vServers A N. In one embodiment the second vServer B may be managing connections from a plurality of clients A N to a second set of services A N . In some embodiments the appliance monitors a second dynamic maximum connection threshold B for a second vServer B. In one embodiment the second vServer B may be acting as a spillover vServer for the first vServer N or a third vServer.

The connection capacity for a service comprises a predetermined number of clients transport layer connections or users a service is designed configured or intended to handle or process. In some embodiments the connection capacity comprises a maximum number of clients connections or users a service is configured targeted or intended to handle or process. In one embodiment a user such as the administrator of the appliance configures the connection capacity for the service . In another embodiment the appliance determines the connection capacity from the service or server providing the service . For example the appliance may transmit a request to the server or service for its connection capacity and in response the server transmits to the appliance a predetermined number of active connections it may handle.

Each of the connection capacities A N may comprise any combination of a same or different connection capacity as another capacity. In one embodiment the connection capacity A for a first server A is different than the connection capacity B of a second server B. In some embodiments the connection capacity A for a first service A is the same as the connection capacity B for a second service B. In another embodiment the connection capacity A of a service A may be set to a value below the service s actual connection capacity. In other embodiments the connection capacity A of a service A may be set to a value above the service s actual connection capacity. In some embodiments the connection capacities may represent a connection based weighting of each of the services A N in a first set or second set of a plurality of services.

The dynamic maximum connection threshold A N generally comprises a predetermined number identifying a maximum number of active transport layer connections the vServer is configured designed or otherwise intended to process handle or have active. In one embodiment a user such as an administrator of the appliance configures the dynamic maximum connection threshold . In another embodiment the appliance sets the dynamic maximum connection threshold to a default value of the sum of the configured connection capacity for each of the services A N managed by the vServer .

The appliance may adjust the dynamic maximum connection threshold in response to events corresponding to a vServer and to one or more services . The appliance may monitor the services using one or more monitoring agents . In one embodiment the appliance may adjust the dynamic maximum connection threshold in response to a monitoring agent reporting a service as unavailable. If a service with a given connection capacity is reported as unavailable the appliance may subtract the service s connection capacity from the dynamic maximum connection threshold of the vServer providing access to that service . Further if the service previously reported as unavailable is then reported as available the appliance may then add back the connection capacity for that service to the dynamic maximum connection threshold .

The monitoring agents may monitor any aspect of a service and may use any technique to determine whether a given service is available. In one embodiment a monitor may measure the response time of a service and report the service as unavailable if the response time exceeds a given threshold. In another embodiment a monitor may measure the response time of a service and report the service as unavailable if the response time exceeds a determined average response time for the service . In still another embodiment a monitor may measure the response time of a service and report the service as unavailable if the response time exceeds a given deviation from a determined average response time for the service.

Although the technique of dynamically adjusted maximum connection threshold is generally discussed in view of transport layer connections and connection requests the appliance may perform this technique for any type and form of transport layer protocol or application layer protocol carried via the transport layer. In one embodiment the appliance may perform dynamic connection spillover among vServers A N using a dynamically adjusted maximum connection threshold for Secure Socket Layer SSL or Transport Layer Security TLS connections and connection requests.

The spillover system of may be deployed or implemented on a multi core system such as a multi core appliance. Referring now to a block diagram of an embodiment of a multi core system that handles spillover for connections to a vServer or the vServers on an appliance is shown and described. The multi core system may comprise any of the embodiments of the multi core system of . The multi core system may establish vServers to load balance a plurality of clients requesting access to one or more services A N of a first set of servers A N. The multi core system may include a pool manager operating on any portion of the multi core system such as any core packet engine or the flow distributor. One of the cores may be designated a master core for which the pool manager operates. The other cores may also run a pool manager for communicating with the master core regarding the connections for the vServers . Each packet processing engine may provide a vServer . As such in some embodiments each core is operating at least one vServer via the packet processing engine. The pool manager may manage the spillover threshold for the plurality of vServers and limits thereof via an exclusive quota pool and or a shared quota pool .

The pool manager may comprise any program application process task or set of executable instructions for managing allocating distributing and or controlling the spillover threshold such as the numbers of connections to the vServers via quota pools. The pool manager may determine the limit for numbers of connections for spillover. From the spillover limit the pool manager may determine the exclusive quota pool and the shared quota pool . The pool manager may allocate to each vServer an exclusive number of connections from the exclusive quota pool .

Any pool manager on any secondary core may request and receive an allocation of connections from the pool manager of the master core. In some embodiments a pool manager on any secondary core may request connections from the exclusive quota pool allocated to the vServer on the secondary core. In other embodiments a pool manager on any secondary core may request a batch number of connections from the shared quota pool .

The pool manager on any secondary core may determine when the vserver on the secondary core has reached its exclusive number of connections. In some embodiments the pool manager may communicate with the pool manager on the master core to determine the availability of connections in the shared quota pool . In some embodiments the pool manager on any secondary core may detect when the vserver on the secondary core has completed a connection and whether the vserver has borrowed from the shared quota pool . In these embodiments the pool manager may determine if the vserver should return quota to the shared quota pool .

The exclusive quota pool may include a predetermined number of connections that may be assigned or allocated to vServer exclusively and or without restrictions. In one aspect the exclusive quota pool provides a number of exclusive connections for a vServer . In some embodiments an allocation of connections from the exclusive quota pool to a specific vServer may not be shared or used by another core or vServer . Exclusive connections from the exclusive quota pool may be divided or allocated across the vservers on the plurality of cores in any manner. In some embodiments each core may be assigned an exclusive number of connections for the vServer . In some embodiments the exclusive quota pool may include a plurality of exclusive quota pools. Each exclusive pool may include an exclusive number of connections for a respective vserver of a core.

The shared quota pool may include a predetermined number of connections that may be shared and or allocated to any vServer in a non exclusive manner. In one aspect the shared quota pool provides a number of non exclusive connections to a vServer . In some embodiments an allocation of shared connections from the shared quota pool to a specific vServer may be returned to the shared quota pool to be used by another vServer . In some embodiments a core of a vServer may access the shared quota pool after the vServer has reached its exclusive number of connections. The shared quota pool may be accessed by any core in the plurality of cores . A vServer on a core that has reached its exclusive number of connections may borrow from the shared quota pool . The core of the vServer may request to borrow connections from the shared quota pool by sending a request to the pool manager . The pool manager may determine if the shared quota pool has available connection uses for the vServer . If connection uses for the vServer are available the pool manager may allocate a batch number of connections to the vServer . The pool manager may decrement the available number of connections in the shared quota pool by the batch number of uses. In some embodiments the core may implement a lock upon borrowing connections from the shared quota pool for its vServer . When the vServer completes its use of the connection the core may determine if the vServer has borrowed from the shared quota pool and return quota. In any of these embodiments either the core or vServer may perform any of the operations described with respect to the quota pools.

The pool manager may allocate the spillover limit of connections for the vServers of the appliance among the exclusive quota pool and the shared quota pool in any manner by any algorithm or decision making process. In some embodiments the pool manager may make the allocation according to user input that configures the quota pools. For example a user may input a percentage to designate the percentage of the limit to be exclusive or shared. The user may input a number to designate the number of exclusive connections for spillover for each core . The user may input a number to designate the number of connections for spillover for the shared quota pool such that the remaining connections may be placed in the exclusive quota pool .

In some embodiments the pool manager may make the allocation according to the performance of the multi core system. In these embodiments the pool manager may evaluate a metric associated with the performance of the multi core system and adjust the allocation of connections for spillover between the exclusive quota pool and the shared quota pool .

Referring now to a flow diagram depicting steps of an embodiment of a method for allocating spillover limit numbers of connections to a vServer is shown and described. In brief overview the method includes identifying step a spillover limit for a number of connections to vServers across a plurality of cores. The method further includes establishing step an exclusive quota pool for the connections based on the limit. The method further includes establishing step a shared quota pool for the connections based on the limit. The method further includes establishing step a batch number of connections to be provided from the shared quota pool. The method further includes allocating step an exclusive number of connections from the exclusive quota pool to a vServer operating on a core.

The pool manager may identify the limit for the number of connections to vServers . This limit may be for the connections to the plurality of vServers across the multi core system the plurality of cores and or packet engines or any portion thereof. In some embodiments a user inputs the limit to the appliance . The user may input the limit through the graphical user interface GUI or the command line interface CLI as described in . The limit may be any type and form of threshold on a number of connections for the vServers to reach a spillover status or condition. In some embodiments the pool manager identifies the limit according to a parameter of the data communication network. In various embodiments the limit may represent a maximum capacity of the vServers . In some embodiments the limit may represent a physical capacity of the vServers . In other embodiments the limit may represent a processing capacity of the vServers . For example the limit may be a maximum number of connections that may run in parallel to vServers . In many embodiments the limit for a number of connections to the vServers may be absolute. In some embodiments the limit may simply be a desired limit. The limit may represent a percent of or a predetermined threshold of a capacity of the vServers . When the total number of connections to vServers reaches the limit the vServers may deny further requests to make a connection.

The pool manager may establish the exclusive quota pool based on the limit. In various embodiments the pool manager establishes the exclusive quota pool by applying a function to the limit. In many embodiments the exclusive quota pool may be a predetermined percentage of the limit. In one example the exclusive quota pool may be established as 80 of the limit. If the number of connections that may run in parallel to vServers has a limit of 100 the exclusive quota pool may be 80 connections. In various embodiments the exclusive quota pool may be established as the largest multiple of the number of cores less than a predetermined percentage of the limit. In one example the limit may be 100 connections to vServers the predetermined percentage may be 80 and the multi core system may have 7 cores. As 80 connections cannot be evenly distributed among 7 cores the exclusive quota pool may be established as 77 connections the largest multiple of 7 that is less than 80.

The pool manager may establish the shared quota pool based on the limit. The shared quota pool may be established by subtracting the exclusive quota pool from the limit. The pool manager may implement the shared quota pool in a memory shared among the cores . In some embodiments the pool manager may implement the shared quota pool using a data structure. The data structure may include variables associated with the limit and the function applied to the limit that establishes the exclusive quota pool . The data structure may include a variable associated with the number of connections in the shared quota pool . The data structure may include a variable associated with the available number of connections in the shared quota pool . The data structure may include variables associated with the identity of one or more vServers borrowing connections from the shared quota pool . The data structure may include variables associated with the number of connections being used by each of the identified vServers .

The pool manager may establish the batch number of connections to be provided from the shared quota pool . The batch number of connections may be the number of connections a vServer borrows whenever the vServer accesses the shared quota pool . The pool manager may establish the batch number by applying a formula to the shared quota pool . In one embodiment the batch number of connections may be 10 of the shared quota pool . If the shared quota pool is for example 20 connections for a vServer the batch number is 2 connections. In another embodiment the batch number of connections may be 20 of the shared quota pool thereby resulting in a batch number of 4 for a shared quota pool of 20 connections. In various embodiments if the application of the formula to the size of the shared quota pool results in a batch number less than 1 the batch number defaults to 1.

The pool manager may allocate an exclusive number of connections from the exclusive quota pool to each vServer . The exclusive number of connections may be the number of times a vServer may create connections without further restrictions. If the vServer wishes to create connections beyond its exclusive number the vServer must borrow a batch number of connections if available from the shared quota pool . The pool manager may establish the exclusive number of connections based on the exclusive quota pool . The exclusive number of connections may be established by dividing the exclusive quota pool by the number of cores . If the exclusive quota pool divided by the number of cores is less than 1 then the exclusive number of uses becomes 0. In these embodiments all the connections to vServers will belong to the shared quota pool and each vServer must borrow from the shared quota pool whenever the vServer wishes to create a connection.

In various embodiments the pool manager receives an updated spillover threshold and updates the exclusive quota pool the exclusive number of connections for each vServer and the shared quota pool according to the updated spillover. In some examples the pool manager receives an updated spillover threshold when the appliance monitors the operational status of the services A N and determines that one or more services A N has changed status from available to not available or vice versa. The appliance adjusts the spillover threshold to a sum of connection capacities for available services. If a service becomes unavailable the appliance subtracts that service s connection capacity from the spillover threshold. If the service becomes available again the appliance adds the service s connection capacity back to the spillover threshold.

Once the appliance adjusts the spillover threshold the pool manager re determines the exclusive quota pool exclusive number of connections for each vServer and shared quota pool according to any of the methods described herein. In some embodiments the pool manager on the main core broadcasts the updated exclusive number of connections to each vServer to each core . A pool manager on each core may receive the updated exclusive number of connections.

Based upon this updated exclusive number of connections the core may determine an updated number of borrowed connections for the vServer . If the exclusive number of connections to the vServer has increased due to a service becoming available the core may determine if any of the connections to the vServer must still be considered borrowed from the shared quota pool and relinquish the lock on any connection that is now exclusive to the vServer . For example a vServer may have 12 active connections and the exclusive number of connections to the vServer may rise from 9 to 15 connections. Because the vServer can connect to 15 connections exclusively the 3 connections previously borrowed from the shared quota pool can now be considered exclusive connections. In this manner the core can relinquish the lock on the three connections.

Conversely if the exclusive number of connections to the vServer has decreased as services become available the core may need to implement locks for connections now considered borrowed from the shared quota pool. For example a vServer may have 12 active connections and the exclusive number of connections to the vServer may decrease from 15 to 9 connections. In this manner 3 connections previously exclusive to the vServer are now considered borrowed from the shared quota pool . Thus the core may implement locks on the three connections.

Referring now to a flow diagram depicting steps of an embodiment of a method for borrowing from a shared quota pool is shown and described. In brief overview the method includes receiving step a request to create a connection for a vServer. The method also includes determining step if the vServer will exceed its exclusive number of connections by fulfilling the request. If the vServer will not exceed its exclusive number of connections the method also includes fulfilling step the request to create the connection. If the vServer will exceed its exclusive number of connections the method also includes requesting step a batch number of connections from the shared quota pool before fulfilling step the request to create the connection.

The multi core system may receive the request to create the connection. The multi core system may assign the request to any core of the plurality of cores. The multi core system may assign the request to a core based on the number of requests each core is processing or any other basis. The request to create the connection may include a request to open a connection to a service. In any of these embodiments the packet processing engine or vServer operating on a core may process the request.

The vServer may determine if the vServer will exceed its exclusive number of connections by fulfilling the request. In various embodiments the vServer makes the determination by comparing its exclusive number of connections to its current number of connections. If the current number of connections 1 is less than or equal to the exclusive number of connections the determination is negative. Otherwise the determination is positive. In many embodiments the vServer may maintain the number of its current connections in a non shared memory. In some embodiments the vServer may include a counter with the number of its current connections.

If the determination is negative the vServer may fulfill the request to create the connection. If the determination is positive the vServer may request a batch number of connections from the shared quota pool before fulfilling the request. In various embodiments the vServer may send a request for a batch number of connections to the pool manager . The pool manager may determine if the shared quota pool has an available batch number of connections. The pool manager may allocate a batch number of connections from the shared quota pool to the requesting vServer. The pool manager may subtract a batch number of connections from the number of available connections in the shared quota pool. The pool manager may send a message to the vServer indicating that the request for a batch number of connections has been granted. In some embodiments the vServer may acquire a lock before fulfilling the request with one of the batch number of connections borrowed from the shared quota pool. In various embodiments the packet processing engine sets a variable indicating that the vServer has borrowed connections from the shared quota pool.

In other embodiments the pool manager may determine that the shared quota pool does not have a batch number of connections available. In some embodiments the pool manager may send a message to the vServer indicating that the request for a batch number of connections cannot be fulfilled. In some embodiments the pool manager may place the request for a batch number of connections and the identity of the requesting vServer in a queue. In some embodiments the request for a batch number of connections in the queue may time out after a predetermined period of time.

In various embodiments the vServer may resend the request for a batch number of connections after a predetermined period of time. In some embodiments the vServer may place the request to create a connection in a queue. In some embodiments the request in the queue may time out after a predetermined period of time. In various embodiments the vServer may send a message to the source of the request to create the connection indicating that the request cannot be fulfilled at that time.

Referring now to a flow diagram depicting steps of an embodiment of a method for returning quota to a shared quota pool is shown and described. In brief overview the method includes detecting step that a connection has been completed. The method also includes determining step if the vServer borrowed from the shared quota pool . The method also includes if the determination is negative completing step the use of the connection. The method also includes if the determination is positive determining step if the number of completed connections for a vServer is greater than or equal to the batch number. If the number of completed connections is not greater than or equal to the batch number the vServer completes the use of the connection. If the number of completed connections is greater than or equal to the batch number the method includes returning step a batch number of connections to the shared quota pool in conjunction with completing step the use of the connection.

In further detail the vServer may detect that a connection has been completed. In some embodiments the resource sends a message to the packet processing engine indicating that the connection has been completed. In other embodiments the vServer determines that a connection has been completed after a predetermined amount of time. In these embodiments the vServer determines a connection has been completed because the connection has timed out. In some embodiments the vServer may receive a message from the source of the request to create the connection indicating that the request has been aborted.

The vServer may determine if the vServer borrowed from the shared quota pool in one of many ways. In some embodiments the vServer may compare the number of its current connections to its exclusive number of connections. If the number of current connections exceeds the exclusive number of connections the vServer may determine that borrowing occurred. In additional embodiments the vServer may evaluate a variable that the vServer sets upon borrowing from the shared quota pool. The vServer may determine that borrowing occurred based upon the value of the variable.

If the vServer determines that the packet processing engine did not borrow from the shared quota pool the vServer may complete using a connection. In some embodiments the vServer may place the connection in a reuse pool. The reuse pool may be exclusive to the packet processing engine . In these embodiments when the vServer receives another request to create a connection the vServer may access one of the connections in the reuse pool instead of opening a new connection. In various embodiments the vServer may close the connection.

If the vServer determines that the vServer borrowed from the shared quota pool the vServer may determine if the number of completed connections is greater than or equal to the batch number. The vServer may make this determination by subtracting the exclusive number of connections from the current number of connections and comparing the result to the batch number. If the difference is less than the batch number the vServer may complete a use of a connection and close the connection. If the difference is equal to or greater than the batch number the vServer may send a message to the pool manager indicating the return of a batch number of connections to the shared quota pool before completing and closing the connection. In these embodiments the vServer may relinquish the lock acquired when the vServer borrowed from the shared quota pool . In various embodiments upon receiving a message indicating that a batch number of connections is being returned to the shared quota pool the pool manager may process requests for a connection in a queue of requests.

Referring now to a flow diagram depicting steps of an embodiment of a method for adjusting the quota pools and batch number in response to an adjustment in the limit is shown and described. In brief overview the method includes detecting step a change in status of a service. The method also includes determining step a new limit of connections based on the change. The method also includes recalculating step the exclusive and shared quota pools and batch number according to the new limit. The method also includes determining step the number of connections that may be returned to the shared quota pool and returning the connections.

In some embodiments a monitoring agent may monitor a service and detect a change in status of a service. In other embodiments the vServer may detect the change as a result of determining the state of a service the vServer owns. Alternatively the vServer may detect the change by receiving a message from the core of the owner vServer of the service regarding the change. In some embodiments the change may be from available to unavailable. In other embodiments the change may be from unavailable to available.

The appliance may determine a new limit of connections based on the change in status of a service. If the change in status of a service is from available to unavailable the appliance may subtract the connection capacity of the service from the limit. If the change in status of a service is from unavailable to available the appliance may add the connection capacity of the service to the limit.

The pool manager on the main core may recalculate the exclusive and shared quota pools and batch number according to the new limit according to any of the methods described in . The pool manager on the responsible core may communicate with the pool managers on the other cores regarding the recalculations. In some embodiments the pool manager on the main core broadcasts the updated exclusive number of connections to each vServer to each core . A pool manager on each core may receive the updated exclusive number of connections.

The core of a vServer may determine the number of connections that may be returned to the shared quota pool and return the connections. For example the pool manager may determine this number by subtracting the number of connections currently being processed by the vServer from the updated exclusive number of connections. If the difference is positive the core may return the difference to the shared quota pool . In some embodiments the core may return the largest multiple of the batch number of connections that is less than or equal to the difference to the shared quota pool . In some embodiments the core may relinquish a lock acquired when it borrowed quota.

Referring now to a method of managing spillover for virtual servers across a plurality of cores in a multi core system is shown and described. In general overview the method includes receiving a request from a client for a service managed by the multi core system step . The method also includes determining that a first virtual server operating on a first core of the multi core system is using at least a first predetermined threshold number of its exclusive number of uses of a resource step . The method also includes determining that a number of available uses of the resource in a shared quota pool has reached a second predetermined threshold step . The method also includes establishing a backup virtual server step . The method also includes forwarding the request for the service to the backup virtual server step .

After the multi core system receives a request for a service managed by the multi core system a pool manager determines that a first virtual server is using at least a first predetermined threshold number of its exclusive number of uses of a resource step . The pool manager may be the pool manager executing on the core of the first virtual server or the pool manager executing on the main core of the multi core system. In some embodiments the first predetermined threshold number is the first virtual server s exclusive number of uses i.e. the appliance begins to consider spilling over when the first virtual server is using all of its exclusive number of uses. In other embodiments the first predetermined threshold number is a percentage of the exclusive number of uses. For example the first predetermined threshold number is 80 of the vServer s exclusive number of uses. In another example the first predetermined threshold number is 80 of the vServer s exclusive number of uses rounded up or down. In these embodiments the appliance begins to consider spilling over before the first virtual server uses all of its exclusive number of uses.

After the pool manager determines that the first virtual server is using at least a first predetermined threshold number of its exclusive number of uses of a resource the pool manager determines that a number of available uses of the resource in a shared quota pool has reached a second predetermined threshold step . In some embodiments the second predetermined threshold is zero 0 . In this manner the appliance considers spilling over when the vServers have exhausted the shared quota pool. In other embodiments the second predetermined threshold is a percentage of the shared quota pool. For example the second predetermined threshold may be 10 or any other percentage of the shared quota pool. Thus the appliance considers spilling over when a fraction of the shared quota pool remains.

After the pool manager determines that a number of available uses of the resource in a shared quota pool has reached a second predetermined threshold a management component establishes a backup virtual server step . The management component of the appliance may establish the backup virtual server in any location. The management component may establish the backup virtual server on a core of the multi core system. In some embodiments the management component may establish the backup virtual server on a core of a different multi core system. In further embodiments the management component may establish the backup virtual server on a separate single core system.

One virtual server A on a first core may spillover to a second virtual server on the same core or a different core. In some embodiments a first virtual server on a first core may spillover to a second virtual server on the first core. In some embodiments a first virtual server on the first core may spillover to a second virtual server on a second core third core fourth core and so on. The second or backup virtual server may also spillover to a third virtual server on the same core or a different core. In various embodiments a virtual server A on a first core may spillover to a virtual server on a core of a different multi core system on another appliance .

After the management component establishes a backup virtual server a connection management mechanism of the appliance forwards the request for the service to the backup virtual server step . In this manner the backup virtual server services the request for service. In some embodiments the management component also determines a number of uses of resources for the multi core system has fallen below the spillover threshold receives a second request for a service managed by the multi core system from a second client and provides the second request to the first virtual server.

In view of the structure functions and apparatus of the systems and methods described here the present solution provides a dynamic efficient and intelligent system for allocating parameter limits for spillover conditions across a plurality of cores in a multi core system. Having described certain embodiments of methods and systems for providing the monitoring in a multi core system it will now become apparent to one of skill in the art that other embodiments incorporating the concepts of the invention may be used. Therefore the invention should not be limited to certain embodiments but should be limited only by the spirit and scope of the following claims.
