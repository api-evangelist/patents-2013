This invention was made with government support under contract number F33657 01 D 0026 awarded by the Department of Defense. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The present disclosure relates to a package for active electronics and more specifically to a package for active electronics having a load spreading interposer.

In antenna arrays a transmit receive T R module is responsible for transmitting and receiving electromagnetic radiation to and from an external element. The T R module is often provided in a T R module package that includes a module having a substrate floor ring frame and lid. This module contains the active electronics. A connector is laminated onto the lid of the module and the T R module package is assembled by adhesion of the connector to the lid. The assembly process to adhere the connector to the lid is called lamination. Lamination uses pressure and an increased temperature to cure the epoxy that is provided between the connector and the lid.

For qualification the entire module assembly with the connector has to be subject to a long period of thermal cycles. During this long period the performance of the adhesive between the housing and the lid material may cause the lid material to thermally expand by a different degree from the connector material the lid material may be made from Kovar and the connector material may be made from Ultum which are coefficient of thermal expansion CTE mismatched materials . Together these effects often lead to delamination of the connector from the lid and may cause exposure of the connector pins extending from the connector to the substrate. Such delamination and exposure are failure modes of the T R module package.

According to one embodiment a package for active electronics is provided. The package includes a housing structure configured to house the active electronics a connector element and an interposer element disposed to define a tie point between the housing structure and the connector element such that the tie point is remote from respective edges of the housing structure and the connector element.

According to another embodiment a package for active electronics is provided and includes a housing structure having a housing and a substrate porch on which pin connectors are disposed a connector element having a spacer portion corresponding to the housing and a connector portion corresponding to the substrate porch and defining connector elements receptive of the pin connectors and an interposer element interposed between the housing and the spacer portion the interposer element being adhered to the housing and fastened to the spacer portion.

According to another embodiment a package for active electronics is provided. The package includes a housing structure having a housing for active electronics and a substrate porch on which pin connectors are disposed a connector element having a spacer portion corresponding to the housing and having a first thickness and a connector portion corresponding to the substrate porch and defining connector elements receptive of the pin connectors the connector portion having a second thickness which is greater than the first thickness and an interposer element interposed between the housing and the connector element spacer portion the interposer element being adhered to the housing and fastened to the connector element spacer portion.

Additional features and advantages are realized through the techniques of the present invention. Other embodiments and aspects of the invention are described in detail herein and are considered a part of the claimed invention. For a better understanding of the invention with the advantages and the features refer to the description and to the drawings.

The description provided herein relates to a package for housing active electronics. The package includes a housing structure such as a T R module a connector element and an interposer element . The interposer element is disposed to define a tie point between the housing structure and the connector element such that the tie point is defined remotely from respective edges of the housing structure and the connector element . With this construction the package reduces a peel moment exhibited in conventional T R module packages eliminates a need for bonding of CTE mismatched materials i.e. Kovar and Ultum further eliminates a need for adhesive between the interposer element and the connector element and thus may rely upon a fastening of the interposer element to the connector element .

With reference to a package for housing active electronics is provided. The package includes a housing structure a connector element an interposer element and adhesive e.g. epoxy interposed between the interposer element and the housing structure . The housing structure may be provided as a type of transmit receive T R module for transmitting and or receiving electromagnetic energy. The housing structure can have various shapes and sizes. For example the housing structure may be a volumetric body with four sidewalls a lid to be described below and a base. In particular the housing structure has a generally planar substrate i.e. the base alignment pins that extend from a backing layer of the substrate and a housing. The alignment pins may be positioned to facilitate connection of the package to an external apparatus e.g. an antenna array .

The housing is configured to house active electronics of the housing structure and is shorter than the substrate in a planar dimension P of the substrate . Thus a portion of the substrate extends beyond a side of the housing whereby a surface of the portion serves as a substrate porch . Pin connectors such as spring loaded connectors e.g. pogo pin connectors are operably disposed on the substrate porch and are electrically connectable to the active electronics housed in the housing .

The connector element has a spacer portion and a connector portion which is connectable with the pin connectors . The spacer portion is generally planar corresponds in position size and shape to the housing of the housing structure and has a first thickness T. That is when the connector portion is connected with the pin connectors the spacer portion generally extends across a lid or an upper surface of the housing and may in some cases cover the lid of the housing completely.

In accordance with embodiments the housing may include a gold plated metallic alloy such as a nickel cobalt ferrous alloy e.g. Kovar or another similar alloy material. The lid may be formed of Kovar or another similar material. The spacer portion and the connector portion may be formed of Ultum or another similar material.

As mentioned above the connector portion is connectable with the pin connectors and may be configured and disposed to correspond to the substrate porch . Thus in some embodiments the connector portion is a part of the spacer portion as a flange that is formed to define connector elements . The connector elements are elongate through holes extending through the connector portion whereby the connector elements are formed to be receptive of the pin connectors . The connector portion may have a second thickness T which is greater than the first thickness T by the thickness of the housing the interposer element and the adhesive .

The connector element may further include a gasket and a head piece see . The gasket is disposed proximate to the interconnection of the connector portion and the substrate porch and serves to protect seal and or insulate the pin connectors during at least assembly processes e.g. heat and pressure treatments . The head piece serves to support secure and protect respective leads of the pin connectors .

The interposer element is interposed between the housing of the housing structure and the spacer portion of the connector element . In this location the interposer element may be adhered to the housing by the adhesive and may be fastened to the spacer portion . The interposer element is generally planar and sized and shaped in correspondence with the corresponding sizes and shapes of the spacer portion and the housing . The interposer element may be formed of various materials including but not limited to stainless steel but should generally be coefficient of thermal expansion CTE matched to the material s of the housing .

As shown in the interposer element may be mechanically fastened to the spacer portion . In accordance with embodiments this mechanical fastening may be achieved by way of one or more rivets or fasteners that register with holes formed in the interposer element and extend through corresponding hollow sections of the spacer portion . It will be understood that the material of the one or more rivets is variable but may be CTE matched to that of the interposer element and the housing .

In addition for the case in which the one or more rivets are used the one or more rivets should be remote from the edges of the interposer element the spacer portion and the housing . Thus a tie point between the spacer portion and the housing as defined by the respective locations of the one or more rivets is similarly remote from respective edges of the spacer portion and the housing . As such a peel moment is moved away from the respective edges of the lid portion of the housing .

In accordance with further embodiments and as shown in respective corners of the spacer portion and the interposer element may be rounded. Thus while a proximal edge of the interposer element runs along an interior surface of the connector portion the proximal corners of the interposer element may recede from the interior surface of the connector portion with increasing proximity to the ultimate edges of the connector portion . Similarly while a proximal edge of the spacer portion runs along an interior surface of the head piece the proximal corners of the spacer portion may recede from the interior surface of the head piece with increasing proximity to the ultimate edges of the head piece .

In accordance with further aspects a method of assembling the package described above is provided. The method includes initially assembling the housing structure and the connector element and fashioning the interposer element . Holes are defined in the interposer element hollow sections are defined in the connector element and the interposer element is fastened e.g. mechanically to the connector element by way of rivets . The adhesive is applied to the lid of the housing of the housing structure and thus the interposer element can be adhered to the housing structure as the pin connectors are received in the connector elements . Pressure treatments for insuring a stable connection between the pin connectors and leads on the substrate porch and heat treatments for curing the adhesive and for quality control testing are subsequently performed.
