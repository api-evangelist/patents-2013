A social networking system which may include a social networking website may enable its users such as persons or organizations to interact with it and with each other through it. The social networking system may with input from a user create and store in the social networking system a user profile associated with the user. The user profile may include demographic information communication channel information and information on personal interests of the user. The social networking system may also with input from a user create and store a record of relationships of the user with other users of the social networking system as well as provide services e.g. wall posts photo sharing event organization messaging games or advertisements to facilitate social interaction between or among users.

The social networking system may transmit over one or more networks content or messages related to its services to a mobile or other computing device of a user. A user may also install software applications on a mobile or other computing device of the user for accessing a user profile of the user and other data within the social networking system. The social networking system may generate a personalized set of content objects to display to a user such as a newsfeed of aggregated stories of other users connected to the user.

A mobile computing device such as a smartphone tablet computer or laptop computer may include functionality for determining its location direction or orientation such as a GPS receiver compass or gyroscope. Such a device may also include functionality for wireless communication such as BLUETOOTH communication near field communication NFC or infrared IR communication or communication with a wireless local area networks WLANs or cellular telephone network. Such a device may also include one or more cameras scanners touchscreens microphones or speakers. Mobile computing devices may also execute software applications such as games web browsers or social networking applications. With social networking applications users may connect communicate and share information with other users in their social networks.

In particular embodiments each user of a mobile application or website may be identified as belonging to a category of users and each user is provided with a base user experience UX when interacting with the mobile application or website. The base user experience may be further customized for each particular user based on the interactions of the particular user with the application logged over a period of time that serves as training data. The signals used to tailor the base user experience may include recent actions location age affinities number of friends number of times the application is run in the foreground or any combination of these. In particular embodiments the application or website may further customize the user experience based on a particular goal of the system hosting the website or application such as for example increasing the amount of user interaction or engagement with the social networking system. For example candidate elements of the user experience e.g. push notifications or user education may be assigned a particular value based on its importance to the particular goal and the candidate elements may be presented to the particular user in accordance with their particular value.

For example a particular image photo sharing feature of the mobile application or website may automatically upload and store images captured by a mobile computing device of the user. The user may choose to share the uploaded images with their friends. The image sharing feature might be enabled for a target group of users of the social networking system. An example target group may include users who take a large number of images or who frequently use the current image sharing features of the social networking system. Users in the target group may be provided a guided tour explaining how the particular image sharing feature is used. The user experience in regard to the guided tour may be further customized based on the logged interactions. For example a first user in the target group may be presented with a pop up view associated with the particular image sharing feature while a second user may be shown a guided interface tour associated with the particular image sharing feature.

As another example a particular feature of a newsfeed may allow users to delete posts from the newsfeed. The deletion feature may have a high value in regard to a particular goal of increasing user interaction with the social networking system and the social networking system may modify the user experience to include information associated with the particular deletion feature over other candidate elements. The user experience educating users on the particular deletion feature may be based on the logged interactions of each user. For example the user experience for a first user may include a video guiding the first user on how to use the particular deletion function while a second user may be presented with a pop up view displaying a summary of how to use the particular deletion function.

As described below personalization of the base UX may include determining one or more modifications to one or more graphical elements of the UI relative to a base user experience UX based on information or interactions of each user. As an example and not by way of limitation users classified as new users to social networking system may be provided one set of functionality when interacting with social networking system . For example social networking system may computationally determine particular users belong to a category of users that may benefit from extra guidance or explanation how to use features of the UI based on the particular users performing a number of seemingly random or contradictory actions on the UI. As described below the UI for these users may include one or more graphical elements that correspond to a guided tour illustrating how to use a particular functionality.

As another example users classified as experienced users may be provided with another set of functionality. For example social networking system may computationally determine particular users belong to a category of users that does not want guidance for particular features of the UI. For example social networking system may computationally determine particular users belong to a category of users that does not want guidance or explanation how to use features of the UI based on the particular users dismissing or closing help windows on the UI. As described below the UI for these users may include one or more graphical elements that correspond to a pop up window providing a brief overview illustrating how to use a particular functionality. Although this disclosure describes personalizing or customizing the base UX on a particular type of computing system this disclosure contemplates personalizing or customizing the UX on any suitable computing system such as for example the third party system described above.

In particular embodiments user actions or connection information logged over a pre determined period of time such as for example by the action logger of social networking system may be used as training data for personalizing the base UX for individual users. In particular embodiments personalization of the base UX may applied to all the users within a category of users. Particular information that may be used as training data may include recent actions performed by the user a geo location associated with the user age affinities number of friends of the user the number of times a particular application is run in the foreground or any combination thereof. In particular embodiments information of the user logged by the action logger of social networking system may function as training data for a machine learning algorithm such as for example support vector machine SVM k means or a neural network executed on social networking system . As an example and not by way of limitation one or more servers of social networking system may receive training data from each user interacting with social networking system and use a machine learning algorithm to computationally determine one or more particular categories applicable to each user as described above. Furthermore the base UX presented by social networking system may be personalized based at least in part on the training data. In particular embodiments computational determination of the particular category associated with each user may be revaluated in response to receiving subsequent updated training data.

In particular embodiments functionality or features may be added to the base UX based at least in part on the training data of the user. As an example and not by way of limitation particular users of social networking system that upload a large number of images to social networking system may provided access to an updated image sharing functionality that automatically uploads and stores images. As another example the image sharing functionality may be provided to users that frequently use a current image sharing functionality. In particular embodiments customization of the base UX may be personalized based at least in part of the particular category associated with the targeted users as described above. As an example and not by way of limitation the UI provided to a first category of users e.g. experienced users of social networking system may include one or more graphical elements corresponding to pop up views explaining one or more features of the updated image sharing functionality while the UI provided to a second category of users e.g. new users may include a graphical element corresponding to a guided tour illustrating how to use the updated image sharing functionality.

In particular embodiments the base UX may be customized based on a goal or objective of a computing system hosting the particular website or application. As an example and not by way of limitation an objective of social networking system may be to increase the amount of user engagement or interaction on social networking system . In particular embodiments additional functionality may be added to the UI associated with the base UX based at least in part on an assigned value each additional functionality has in regard to the particular objective. As an example and not by way of limitation additional functionality may be selected that has a highest assigned value relative to the particular objective. For example a particular functionality such as for example functionality to delete posts from a newsfeed may be provided to users of social networking system . Furthermore the functionality to delete posts from a newsfeed may be assigned a high value in regard to the objective of increasing engagement on social networking system relative to other candidate functionality. In particular embodiments the base UX for users provided access to the particular functionality may be modified to provide information in regard to features of the particular functionality. Furthermore the modification of the base UX may be based on actions of the user logged by the action log as described above. As an example and not by way of limitation the base UX of a user may include a video providing guidance illustrating how to use the particular feature based on actions classifying the user in a category of users that need extra guidance. As another example the base UX of another user may include a pop up view that may provide a summary of how to use the particular feature based on actions classifying the user in a category of users that want minimal guidance.

In conjunction with the action log a third party content object log may be maintained of user exposure to third party content objects. A notification controller may provide information regarding content objects to a client system . Information may be pushed to a client system as notifications or information may be pulled from client system responsive to a request received from client system . Authorization servers may be used to enforce one or more privacy settings of the users of social networking system . A privacy setting of a user determines how particular information associated with a user can be shared. The authorization server may allow users to opt in to or opt out of having their actions logged by social networking system or shared with other systems e.g. third party system such as for example by setting appropriate privacy settings. Third party content object stores may be used to store content objects received from third parties such as a third party system . Location stores may be used for storing location information received from client systems associated with users. Advertisement pricing modules may combine social information the current time location information or other suitable information to provide relevant advertisements in the form of notifications to a user.

In particular embodiments one or more of the content objects of the online social network may be associated with a privacy setting. The privacy settings or access settings for an object may be stored in any suitable manner such as for example in association with the object in an index on an authorization server in another suitable manner or any combination thereof. A privacy setting of an object may specify how the object or particular information associated with an object can be accessed e.g. viewed or shared using the online social network. Where the privacy settings for an object allow a particular user to access that object the object may be described as being visible with respect to that user. As an example and not by way of limitation a user of the online social network may specify privacy settings for a user profile page identify a set of users that may access the work experience information on the user profile page thus excluding other users from accessing the information. In particular embodiments the privacy settings may specify a blocked list of users that should not be allowed to access certain information associated with the object. In other words the blocked list may specify one or more users or entities for which an object is not visible. As an example and not by way of limitation a user may specify a set of users that may not access photos albums associated with the user thus excluding those users from accessing the photo albums while also possibly allowing certain users not within the set of users to access the photo albums . In particular embodiments privacy settings may be associated with particular social graph elements. Privacy settings of a social graph element such as a node or an edge may specify how the social graph element information associated with the social graph element or content objects associated with the social graph element can be accessed using the online social network. As an example and not by way of limitation a particular concept node corresponding to a particular photo may have a privacy setting specifying that the photo may only be accessed by users tagged in the photo and their friends. In particular embodiments privacy settings may allow users to opt in or opt out of having their actions logged by social networking system or shared with other systems e.g. third party system . In particular embodiments the privacy settings associated with an object may specify any suitable granularity of permitted access or denial of access. As an example and not by way of limitation access or denial of access may be specified for particular users e.g. only me my roommates and my boss users within a particular degrees of separation e.g. friends or friends of friends user groups e.g. the gaming club my family user networks e.g. employees of particular employers students or alumni of particular university all users public no users private users of third party systems particular applications e.g. third party applications external websites other suitable users or entities or any combination thereof. Although this disclosure describes using particular privacy settings in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates using any suitable privacy settings in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments one or more servers may be authorization privacy servers for enforcing privacy settings. In response to a request from a user or other entity for a particular object stored in a data store social networking system may send a request to the data store for the object. The request may identify the user associated with the request and may only be sent to the user or a client system of the user if the authorization server determines that the user is authorized to access the object based on the privacy settings associated with the object. If the requesting user is not authorized to access the object the authorization server may prevent the requested object from being retrieved from the data store or may prevent the requested object from be sent to the user. In the search query context an object may only be generated as a search result if the querying user is authorized to access the object. In other words the object must have a visibility that is visible to the querying user. If the object has a visibility that is not visible to the user the object may be excluded from the search results. Although this disclosure describes enforcing privacy settings in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates enforcing privacy settings in any suitable manner.

As described above users associated with user nodes may be classified into particular categories based at least in part on information associated with user nodes . As an example and not by way of limitation users may be categorized based at least in part on age location number of friends or any combination thereof. Furthermore the users may be classified based on information associated with user nodes in conjunction with other information associated with the users stored in an action log as described above such as for example recent actions performed by users on social networking system .

In particular embodiments a concept node may correspond to a concept. As an example and not by way of limitation a concept may correspond to a place such as for example a movie theater restaurant landmark or city a website such as for example a website associated with social network system or a third party website associated with a web application server an entity such as for example a person business group sports team or celebrity a resource such as for example an audio file video file digital photo text file structured document or application which may be located within social networking system or on an external server such as a web application server real or intellectual property such as for example a sculpture painting movie game song idea photograph or written work a game an activity an idea or theory another suitable concept or two or more such concepts. A concept node may be associated with information of a concept provided by a user or information gathered by various systems including social networking system . As an example and not by way of limitation information of a concept may include a name or a title one or more images e.g. an image of the cover page of a book a location e.g. an address or a geographical location a website which may be associated with a URL contact information e.g. a phone number or an email address other suitable concept information or any suitable combination of such information. In particular embodiments a concept node may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with concept node . In particular embodiments a concept node may correspond to one or more webpages.

In particular embodiments a node in social graph may represent or be represented by a webpage which may be referred to as a profile page . Profile pages may be hosted by or accessible to social networking system . Profile pages may also be hosted on third party websites associated with a third party server . As an example and not by way of limitation a profile page corresponding to a particular external webpage may be the particular external webpage and the profile page may correspond to a particular concept node . Profile pages may be viewable by all or a selected subset of other users. As an example and not by way of limitation a user node may have a corresponding user profile page in which the corresponding user may add content make declarations or otherwise express himself or herself. As another example and not by way of limitation a concept node may have a corresponding concept profile page in which one or more users may add content make declarations or express themselves particularly in relation to the concept corresponding to concept node .

In particular embodiments a concept node may represent a third party webpage or resource hosted by a third party system . The third party webpage or resource may include among other elements content a selectable or other icon or other inter actable object which may be implemented for example in JavaScript AJAX or PHP codes representing an action or activity. As an example and not by way of limitation a third party webpage may include a selectable icon such as like check in eat recommend or another suitable action or activity. A user viewing the third party webpage may perform an action by selecting one of the icons e.g. eat causing a client system to transmit to social networking system a message indicating the user s action. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge e.g. an eat edge between a user node corresponding to the user and a concept node corresponding to the third party webpage or resource and store edge in one or more data stores.

In particular embodiments a pair of nodes in social graph may be connected to each other by one or more edges . An edge connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes. In particular embodiments an edge may include or represent one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user may indicate that a second user is a friend of the first user. In response to this indication social networking system may transmit a friend request to the second user. If the second user confirms the friend request social networking system may create an edge connecting the first user s user node to the second user s user node in social graph and store edge as social graph information in one or more of data stores . In the example of social graph includes an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user A and user B and an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user C and user B. Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular edges with particular attributes connecting particular user nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes . As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent a friendship family relationship business or employment relationship fan relationship follower relationship visitor relationship subscriber relationship superior subordinate relationship reciprocal relationship non reciprocal relationship another suitable type of relationship or two or more such relationships. Moreover although this disclosure generally describes nodes as being connected this disclosure also describes users or concepts as being connected. Herein references to users or concepts being connected may where appropriate refer to the nodes corresponding to those users or concepts being connected in social graph by one or more edges .

In particular embodiments an edge between a user node and a concept node may represent a particular action or activity performed by a user associated with user node toward a concept associated with a concept node . As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in a user may like attended played listened cooked worked at or watched a concept each of which may correspond to a edge type or subtype. A concept profile page corresponding to a concept node may include for example a selectable check in icon such as for example a clickable check in icon or a selectable like icon. As another example the socialized dash of a client system may include a selectable check in icon such as for example a clickable check in icon or a selectable like icon. Similarly after a user clicks these icons social networking system may create a like edge or a check in edge in response to a user s action corresponding to a respective action. As another example and not by way of limitation a user user C may listen to a particular song Ramble On using a particular application SPOTIFY which is an online music application . In this case social networking system may create a listened edge and a used edge as illustrated in between user nodes corresponding to the user and concept nodes corresponding to the song and application to indicate that the user listened to the song and used the application. Moreover social networking system may create a played edge as illustrated in between concept nodes corresponding to the song and the application to indicate that the particular song was played by the particular application. In this case played edge corresponds to an action performed by an external application SPOTIFY on an external audio file the song Imagine . Although this disclosure describes particular edges with particular attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes . Moreover although this disclosure describes edges between a user node and a concept node representing a single relationship this disclosure contemplates edges between a user node and a concept node representing one or more relationships. As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent both that a user likes and has used at a particular concept. Alternatively another edge may represent each type of relationship or multiples of a single relationship between a user node and a concept node as illustrated in between user node for user E and concept node for SPOTIFY .

In particular embodiments social networking system may create an edge between a user node and a concept node in social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation a user viewing a concept profile page such as for example by using a web browser or a special purpose application hosted by the user s client system may indicate that he or she likes the concept represented by the concept node by clicking or selecting a Like icon which may cause the user s client system to transmit to social networking system a message indicating the user s liking of the concept associated with the concept profile page. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge between user node associated with the user and concept node as illustrated by like edge between the user and concept node . In particular embodiments social networking system may store an edge in one or more data stores. In particular embodiments an edge may be automatically formed by social networking system in response to a particular user action. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user uploads a picture watches a movie or listens to a song an edge may be formed between user node corresponding to the first user and concept nodes corresponding to those concepts. Although this disclosure describes forming particular edges in particular manners this disclosure contemplates forming any suitable edges in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may determine the social graph affinity which may be referred to herein as affinity of various social graph entities for each other. Affinity may represent the strength of a relationship or level of interest between particular objects associated with the online social network such as users concepts content actions advertisements other objects associated with the online social network or any suitable combination thereof. Affinity may also be determined with respect to objects associated with third party systems or other suitable systems. An overall affinity for a social graph entity for each user subject matter or type of content may be established. The overall affinity may change based on continued monitoring of the actions or relationships associated with the social graph entity. Although this disclosure describes determining particular affinities in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining any suitable affinities in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may measure or quantify social graph affinity using an affinity coefficient which may be referred to herein as coefficient . The coefficient may represent or quantify the strength of a relationship between particular objects associated with the online social network. The coefficient may also represent a probability or function that measures a predicted probability that a user will perform a particular action based on the user s interest in the action. In this way a user s future actions may be predicted based on the user s prior actions where the coefficient may be calculated at least in part a the history of the user s actions. Coefficients may be used to predict any number of actions which may be within or outside of the online social network. As an example and not by way of limitation these actions may include various types of communications such as sending messages posting content or commenting on content various types of a observation actions such as accessing or viewing profile pages media or other suitable content various types of coincidence information about two or more social graph entities such as being in the same group tagged in the same photograph checked in at the same location or attending the same event or other suitable actions. Although this disclosure describes measuring affinity in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates measuring affinity in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may use a variety of factors to calculate a coefficient. These factors may include for example user actions types of relationships between objects location information other suitable factors or any combination thereof. In particular embodiments different factors may be weighted differently when calculating the coefficient. The weights for each factor may be static or the weights may change according to for example the user the type of relationship the type of action the user s location and so forth. Ratings for the factors may be combined according to their weights to determine an overall coefficient for the user. As an example and not by way of limitation particular user actions may be assigned both a rating and a weight while a relationship associated with the particular user action is assigned a rating and a correlating weight e.g. so the weights total 100 . To calculate the coefficient of a user towards a particular object the rating assigned to the user s actions may comprise for example 60 of the overall coefficient while the relationship between the user and the object may comprise 40 of the overall coefficient. In particular embodiments the social networking system may consider a variety of variables when determining weights for various factors used to calculate a coefficient such as for example the time since information was accessed decay factors frequency of access relationship to information or relationship to the object about which information was accessed relationship to social graph entities connected to the object short or long term averages of user actions user feedback other suitable variables or any combination thereof. As an example and not by way of limitation a coefficient may include a decay factor that causes the strength of the signal provided by particular actions to decay with time such that more recent actions are more relevant when calculating the coefficient. The ratings and weights may be continuously updated based on continued tracking of the actions upon which the coefficient is based. Any type of process or algorithm may be employed for assigning combining averaging and so forth the ratings for each factor and the weights assigned to the factors. In particular embodiments social networking system may determine coefficients using machine learning algorithms trained on historical actions and past user responses or data farmed from users by exposing them to various options and measuring responses. Although this disclosure describes calculating coefficients in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates calculating coefficients in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on a user s actions. Social networking system may monitor such actions on the online social network on a third party system on other suitable systems or any combination thereof. Any suitable type of user actions may be tracked or monitored. Typical user actions include viewing profile pages creating or posting content interacting with content tagging or being tagged in images joining groups listing and confirming attendance at events checking in at locations liking particular pages creating pages and performing other tasks that facilitate social action. In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on the user s actions with particular types of content. The content may be associated with the online social network a third party system or another suitable system. The content may include users profile pages posts news stories headlines instant messages chat room conversations emails advertisements pictures video music other suitable objects or any combination thereof. Social networking system may analyze a user s actions to determine whether one or more of the actions indicate an affinity for subject matter content other users and so forth. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user may make frequently posts content related to coffee or variants thereof social networking system may determine the user has a high coefficient with respect to the concept coffee . Particular actions or types of actions may be assigned a higher weight and or rating than other actions which may affect the overall calculated coefficient. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user emails a second user the weight or the rating for the action may be higher than if the first user simply views the user profile page for the second user.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on the type of relationship between particular objects. Referencing the social graph social networking system may analyze the number and or type of edges connecting particular user nodes and concept nodes when calculating a coefficient. As an example and not by way of limitation user nodes that are connected by a spouse type edge representing that the two users are married may be assigned a higher coefficient than a user nodes that are connected by a friend type edge. In other words depending upon the weights assigned to the actions and relationships for the particular user the overall affinity may be determined to be higher for content about the user s spouse than for content about the user s friend. In particular embodiments the relationships a user has with another object may affect the weights and or the ratings of the user s actions with respect to calculating the coefficient for that object. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user is tagged in first photo but merely likes a second photo social networking system may determine that the user has a higher coefficient with respect to the first photo than the second photo because having a tagged in type relationship with content may be assigned a higher weight and or rating than having a like type relationship with content. In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient for a first user based on the relationship one or more second users have with a particular object. In other words the connections and coefficients other users have with an object may affect the first user s coefficient for the object. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user is connected to or has a high coefficient for one or more second users and those second users are connected to or have a high coefficient for a particular object social networking system may determine that the first user should also have a relatively high coefficient for the particular object. In particular embodiments the coefficient may be based on the degree of separation between particular objects. The lower coefficient may represent the decreasing likelihood that the first user will share an interest in content objects of the user that is indirectly connected to the first user in the social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation social graph entities that are closer in the social graph i.e. fewer degrees of separation may have a higher coefficient than entities that are further apart in the social graph .

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on location information. Objects that are geographically closer to each other may be considered to be more related or of more interest to each other than more distant objects. In particular embodiments the coefficient of a user towards a particular object may be based on the proximity of the object s location to a current location associated with the user or the location of a client system of the user . A first user may be more interested in other users or concepts that are closer to the first user. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user is one mile from an airport and two miles from a gas station social networking system may determine that the user has a higher coefficient for the airport than the gas station based on the proximity of the airport to the user.

In particular embodiments social networking system may perform particular actions with respect to a user based on coefficient information. Coefficients may be used to predict whether a user will perform a particular action based on the user s interest in the action. A coefficient may be used when generating or presenting any type of objects to a user such as advertisements search results news stories media messages notifications or other suitable objects. The coefficient may also be utilized to rank and order such objects as appropriate. In this way social networking system may provide information that is relevant to user s interests and current circumstances increasing the likelihood that they will find such information of interest. In particular embodiments social networking system may generate content based on coefficient information. Content objects may be provided or selected based on coefficients specific to a user. As an example and not by way of limitation the coefficient may be used to generate media for the user where the user may be presented with media for which the user has a high overall coefficient with respect to the media object. As another example and not by way of limitation the coefficient may be used to generate advertisements for the user where the user may be presented with advertisements for which the user has a high overall coefficient with respect to the advertised object. In particular embodiments social networking system may generate search results based on coefficient information. Search results for a particular user may be scored or ranked based on the coefficient associated with the search results with respect to the querying user. As an example and not by way of limitation search results corresponding to objects with higher coefficients may be ranked higher on a search results page than results corresponding to objects having lower coefficients.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient in response to a request for a coefficient from a particular system or process. To predict the likely actions a user may take or may be the subject of in a given situation any process may request a calculated coefficient for a user. The request may also include a set of weights to use for various factors used to calculate the coefficient. This request may come from a process running on the online social network from a third party system e.g. via an API or other communication channel or from another suitable system. In response to the request social networking system may calculate the coefficient or access the coefficient information if it has previously been calculated and stored . In particular embodiments social networking system may measure an affinity with respect to a particular process. Different processes both internal and external to the online social network may request a coefficient for a particular object or set of objects. Social networking system may provide a measure of affinity that is relevant to the particular process that requested the measure of affinity. In this way each process receives a measure of affinity that is tailored for the different context in which the process will use the measure of affinity.
