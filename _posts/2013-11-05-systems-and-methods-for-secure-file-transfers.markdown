This disclosure generally relates to communication security and in particular to systems and methods for secure file transfers.

Monitoring and diagnostic M D centers can provide numerous services for power plant units as well as other assets. Such services may include asset monitoring event tracking trip event reporting root cause classification forced outage detection diagnostics and reporting with various recommendations to a site. Raw operational data as well as post processed data can be derived from analytics which may be used by various engineering teams for performance and reliability studies warranty support and engineering research and development.

However new requirements are being imposed for the large set of existing power plants requiring relatively secure file transfers. Many sites need to comply with North American Electric Reliability Corporation NERC or other regulatory security requirements and other communication security challenges. In addition many of these sites have limited bandwidth connections and relatively unstable or otherwise unreliable links.

Typically the onsite monitoring is located within the power plant infrastructure. The onsite network is usually protected by firewalls and a proxy at the plant edge that may prevent inbound connections and thus enforcing that the onsite monitoring is non routable. Furthermore all standard bi directional TCP HTTP communication ports are usually blocked by the firewall to ensure the security of the system.

Current communications typically require a bi directional based communication ports schema and current data transport technologies are generally not able to adequately deal with dial up or low bandwidth network topologies e.g. significant latency bandwidth management under stress conditions . Furthermore a uni directional general purpose file transfer solution is not available.

In order to meet new and ever growing customer security requirements relatively secure file transfer solutions are needed to provide secure data transfer for transport of data between an onsite monitoring system and a central monitoring and diagnostic infrastructure. A secure file transfer package is needed to be deployed to support onsite monitoring sites with limited bandwidth connections and relatively unstable or otherwise unreliable links so that they can comply with NERC or other regulatory requirements and meet other communication security challenges.

Some or all of the above needs may be addressed by certain embodiments of the disclosure. According to an example embodiment there is disclosed a method for transferring data that may include collecting operational data by an onsite system behind a firewall writing output files in a transfer directory scheduling an asynchronous intelligent transfer service establishing a secure certificate based uni directional encrypted link between the onsite system and a central system initiating a command upload message for asynchronous concurrent parallel file upload creating associated outbound datagrams sending the outbound datagrams over a predetermined specific port and reconstructing the outbound datagrams by the central system.

The method may further include sending to an open outbound uni directional port by the central system a file download request message within a reply to a previous message from the onsite system initiating by the onsite system a download command message for asynchronous concurrent parallel files download creating by the central system associated secure datagrams sending the inbound datagrams serially over the port using a previously opened connection and reconstructing the inbound datagrams by the onsite system.

In another embodiment a system for transferring data is disclosed. The system may comprise an onsite system behind a firewall. The onsite system may be operable to collect operational data write files in a transfer directory schedule an asynchronous intelligent transfer service establish a secure certificate based uni directional encrypted link between the onsite system and a central system initiate a command upload message for asynchronous concurrent parallel file upload create associated outbound datagrams and send the outbound datagrams over a predetermined specific port. The central system may be operable to reconstruct the outbound datagrams based at least in part on received outbound datagrams and send a file download request message within a reply to a previous message from the onsite system to an open outbound uni directional port.

Other embodiments features and aspects of the disclosure are described in detail herein and are considered a part of the claimed disclosure. Other embodiments features and aspects can be understood with reference to the following detailed description accompanying drawings and claims.

Example embodiments of the disclosure now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which some but not all embodiments are shown. Indeed the disclosure may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.

To achieve secure file transfers supporting onsite monitoring of power plants with limited bandwidth connections or relatively unstable or otherwise unreliable links a new infrastructure combining various hardware software and networking technologies has been developed. Certain embodiments of the disclosure may have the technical effect of enabling asynchronous service oriented extraction of data from a repository on the onsite monitoring system and transferring data to a central storage repository for analytics processing. Another technical effect of certain embodiments of the disclosure may allow asynchronous parallel simultaneous downloading and uploading of files between designated servers in the central monitoring and diagnostic infrastructure and the onsite monitoring system while providing security dynamic guarantee of service and reliability features.

Referring to of the drawings there is shown a schematic block diagram of an example system architecture for providing secure data transfer for transport of data between an onsite monitoring system and a central monitoring and diagnostic infrastructure.

The onsite monitoring system may be implemented by using a Windows based platform typically a high computing server with various networking capabilities and may be collocated at the power plant site behind a corporate firewall . The onsite network may be protected by firewalls and a proxy at the plant edge preventing inbound connections and thus enforcing that the onsite monitoring is non routable. Furthermore all standard bi directional TCP HTTP communication ports may be blocked by the firewall .

The onsite monitoring secure remote access solution may provide monitoring and diagnostic users with the ability to securely and remotely access the onsite monitoring system and perform certain administration or management tasks. Communication security may be provided by integrating the HTTPS TLS protocols stack with a customized software package referred to as an intelligent agent.

A user utilizing the central system Intranet or a remote user connected to the outside Internet may establish a connection to a remote enterprise server . The remote enterprise server may establish a connection with an enterprise tunneling server . The user may then establish a user initiated remote desktop protocol RDP session to the onsite monitoring system . Communication security may be provided using a TLS SSL based tunneling methodology encapsulating the remote access session data.

An M D user or a remote user may request an RDP connection to the onsite monitoring system . Since the traffic port is uni directional open outbound only the agent server may initiate an RDP session request message within a reply to any previous message from an intelligent agent residing on a server within the onsite monitoring system . The intelligent agent then may connect to a RDP module within the onsite monitoring system .

Referring to illustrated is an example of onsite monitoring OSM in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure. The OSM may be implemented on a Windows based platform typically a high performance server with various networking capabilities and is collocated at the power plant site behind the corporate firewalls.

Data collection software modules may be associated with the collection of the units operational and dynamic data such as temperature pressure flow rate clearance e.g. distance between two components and vibration data of turbo machinery. Various types of controllers based on network connectivity capabilities and raw data resolution are used to interface with the unit sensors. The controller may range from the proprietary controllers to standard Ethernet Data Acquisition Systems EDAS . The collected raw data may then be processed and transferred to other OSM modules via data hubs. The data hubs may collect tremendous volumes of real time production information and perform supervisory automation along with delivery of reliable information to higher level analytic applications. Such data hubs may include certain proprietary hubs such as WSST cimplicity and the eHistorian collector modules. In addition these modules can provide a combined source for data quality and time coherency.

The storage software modules may be associated with data storage and archiving. The software platform can be a proprietary platform such as PROFICY HISTORIAN and can provide the ability for local storage of time series data as well as processed data generated by the analytics outputs. It can also provide the ability to manage data quality using various compression and interpolation techniques.

The data processing modules may be associated with data processing as well as events and alarms escalation. Analytics based data processing may be provided by a proprietary platform such as CENTRAL CONDITION ASSESSMENT PLATFORM LOCAL EDITION CCAP LE and continuous diagnostic engine CDE rule engine platforms . Alarms and event escalation may be performed by an action engine and may send notifications via email or web based services.

The transfer modules may be associated with data transfer to the central monitoring and diagnostic system. Two types of transport mechanisms are generally available based on site specific security requirements network topology and available bandwidth. The first mechanism may leverage a historian collector to collector service to provide real time data streaming transport. The second mechanism combines the services provided by a low bandwidth and intelligent agent modules for secure one way traffic push asynchronous concurrent and reliable files transport.

Accordingly at least one technical effect may enable low bandwidth and intelligent agent modules to provide secure one way traffic asynchronous concurrent and reliable files transport.

The central system transfer modules may be associated with data transfer from the onsite system. Two types of transport mechanisms are generally available. The first mechanism may leverage a historian collector to collector service to provide real time data streaming transport. The second mechanism may provide relatively low bandwidth import services for a relatively secure one way traffic push asynchronous concurrent and reliable file transport.

The central storage software modules may be associated with the data storage and archiving of the time series data initially collected and transferred from the OSM s fleet. This software platform may provide the ability for storage of time series data as well as processed data generated by the analytics outputs. The central storage software module may provide enterprise wide data historian services that archive and distribute tremendous volumes of real time production information at extremely high speeds. It may also provide the ability to manage data quality using various compression and interpolation techniques.

The central storage software modules such as PROFICY HISTORIAN may be operable to compare years of historical data to real time data to allow for a myriad of analysis possibilities. This solution may provide the tools to compare assets across a fleet and over long periods of time to better understand how equipment and processes are running versus how they should be running.
