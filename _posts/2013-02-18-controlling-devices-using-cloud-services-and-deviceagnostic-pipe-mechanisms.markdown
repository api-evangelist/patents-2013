Some device manufacturers have attempted to make their devices more intelligent by embedding processing modules into the devices. For example a high end automobile manufacturer may produce a control system that is driven by one or more processing modules. Each processing module may run one or more applications. A user may interact with these applications via an on board display device such as an LCD display or the like. The user may also program the applications through this manner of interaction.

Some device manufacturers also provide devices that have the ability to interact with remote functionality. For example a control system of an automobile may couple its processing modules to a remote server. Applications running on the control system may exchange data with this remote functionality for various purposes e.g. to receive maps media content etc.

The above control strategies provide consumers with more versatile and complex devices. However for reasons specified herein these strategies also have potential drawbacks.

An environment is described herein that includes a service system that hosts one or more services. The services provide logic which controls the operation of a plurality of target devices. This strategy eliminates the need for the target devices to provide local embedded intelligence. In other words in one implementation the target devices may be produced as dumb equipment which lacks or has limited reliance on local control logic.

According to one illustrative aspect the services are coupled to the target devices via respective pipe mechanisms. The pipe mechanisms handle the flow of data from the target devices to the service system and the flow of control instructions from the service system to the target devices. In one implementation the pipe mechanisms are constructed in a device agnostic manner. This means that any pipe mechanism is capable of interacting with plural types of target devices without regard to the native functionality provided by the target devices.

According to another illustrative aspect the device agnostic pipe mechanisms can be supplied to device manufacturers. The device manufacturers can then incorporate the pipe mechanisms into their respective target devices. Alternatively or in addition the pipe mechanisms can be supplied to end users of target devices. The end users may then couple the pipe mechanisms to the target devices in a detachable manner. In one implementation each pipe mechanism may be pre programmed to interact with the service system e.g. by storing the address of the service system in its data store. Each pipe mechanism may also include functionality that enables it to interact with the service system in a secure manner for example the interaction may utilize the Transport Layer Security TLS protocol and or some other security protocol or mechanism.

According to another illustrative aspect a user may interact with a service via an application that runs on any user device such as a smart phone a tablet device a personal computer etc. Through this channel the user may configure the service to control the user s target device in a desired manner.

According to another illustrative aspect the service system may provide set up functionality that allows a user to establish a nexus between a user account a particular target device and the pipe mechanism associated with the target device.

The above control strategies can be manifested in various types of systems components methods computer readable storage media data structures articles of manufacture and so on.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form these concepts are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

The same numbers are used throughout the disclosure and figures to reference like components and features. Series 100 numbers refer to features originally found in series 200 numbers refer to features originally found in series 300 numbers refer to features originally found in and so on.

This disclosure is organized as follows. Section A describes an illustrative environment for controlling target devices using a service system and device agnostic pipe mechanisms. Section B describes illustrative methods which explain the operation of the functionality of Section A.

As a preliminary matter some of the figures describe concepts in the context of one or more structural components variously referred to as functionality modules features elements etc. The various components shown in the figures can be implemented in any manner by any physical and tangible mechanisms for instance by software hardware e.g. chip implemented logic functionality firmware etc. and or any combination thereof. In one case the illustrated separation of various components in the figures into distinct units may reflect the use of corresponding distinct physical and tangible components in an actual implementation. Alternatively or in addition any single component illustrated in the figures may be implemented by plural actual physical components. Alternatively or in addition the depiction of any two or more separate components in the figures may reflect different functions performed by a single actual physical component. to be described in turn provide additional details regarding one illustrative physical implementation of the functions shown in the figures.

Other figures describe the concepts in flowchart form. In this form certain operations are described as constituting distinct blocks performed in a certain order. Such implementations are illustrative and non limiting. Certain blocks described herein can be grouped together and performed in a single operation certain blocks can be broken apart into plural component blocks and certain blocks can be performed in an order that differs from that which is illustrated herein including a parallel manner of performing the blocks . The blocks shown in the flowcharts can be implemented in any manner by any physical and tangible mechanisms for instance by software hardware e.g. chip implemented logic functionality firmware etc. and or any combination thereof.

As to terminology the phrase configured to encompasses any way that any kind of physical and tangible functionality can be constructed to perform an identified operation. The functionality can be configured to perform an operation using for instance software hardware e.g. chip implemented logic functionality firmware etc. and or any combination thereof.

The term logic encompasses any physical and tangible functionality for performing a task. For instance each operation illustrated in the flowcharts corresponds to a logic component for performing that operation. An operation can be performed using for instance software hardware e.g. chip implemented logic functionality firmware etc. and or any combination thereof. When implemented by a computing system a logic component represents an electrical component that is a physical part of the computing system however implemented.

The phrase means for in the claims if used is intended to invoke the provisions of 35 U.S.C. 112 sixth paragraph. No other language other than this specific phrase is intended to invoke the provisions of that portion of the statute.

The following explanation may identify one or more features as optional. This type of statement is not to be interpreted as an exhaustive indication of features that may be considered optional that is other features can be considered as optional although not expressly identified in the text. Finally the terms exemplary or illustrative refer to one implementation among potentially many implementations

Each pipe mechanism serves a control agnostic role of passing information between a target device and the service system . The pipe mechanism is said to be control agnostic because it is not configured to perform any particular control function s or to interpret the information that passes through it with respect to any particular control regimen. Rather it may be used in the context of any type of control regimen.

Moreover each pipe mechanism is constructed in a device agnostic manner. This means that each pipe mechanism has the capacity to interact with different kinds of target devices irrespective of the native functionality provided by the target devices . In one case the environment achieves this result by hosting a set of identically constructed pipe mechanisms . That is in this case each pipe mechanism has the same hardware and programming as other pipe mechanisms. In another case the environment provides different classes of pipe mechanisms . Each class may differ from the others by accommodating a different type of communication such as cellular communication satellite communication WiFi communication communication via hardwired connection etc.

The environment offers one or more potential benefits. First the environment delegates the intelligence associated with a control task to the service system rather than each individual target device. As a result the environment gives the device manufacturers the freedom to produce target devices that are to varying degrees considered dumb. A dumb device refers to a device that lacks processor implemented intelligence and or other facets of local implemented control. The environment also allows the device manufacturers to eliminate or reduce input output mechanisms that are typically used by intelligent devices e.g. to program and interact with these devices. These aspects in turn may reduce the complexity and cost of the manufacturing process.

Second the environment provides a uniform and standard framework for controlling different kinds of target devices . This aspect in turn may benefit device manufacturers and end users alike by reducing the complexity and cost associated with the task of controlling plural target devices . For example the environment frees an end user from the responsibility of learning different control protocols associated with different target devices. The environment also offers the end user a more convenient mechanism for programming each target device to be described below compared to interacting with the input output mechanism associated with the target device itself.

The above advantages are cited by way of example not limitation. Other implementations of the environment may offer additional technical advantages.

Jumping ahead momentarily in the sequence of figures consider the high level conceptual overview provided in . That figure shows two strategies that may be used to provide the pipe mechanisms to device manufacturers in the case of option A and end users in the case of option B . In both options an entity or entities which provide the pipe mechanisms is referred to as a pipe provider . In one case the pipe provider corresponds to the same entity which provides and administers the service system . In another case the pipe provider and the entity which hosts the service system are two different respective entities. That is in this embodiment a first business enterprise can produce the pipe mechanisms while a second business enterprise can operate the service system .

In option A the pipe provider can provide the pipe mechanisms to device manufacturers . Here the term device manufacturer encompasses manufacturers which produce target devices from scratch based on raw materials as well as manufacturers which assemble target devices from smaller pre constructed components as well as manufacturers which perform a combination of these activities. The device manufacturers may add the pipe mechanisms to the target devices as part of the manufacturing process of the target devices . The device manufacturers can use different strategies to achieve this result. In one case the device manufacturers can embed pipe mechanisms as fixed components of target devices. In another case the device manufacturers can add the pipe mechanisms as detachable components of the target devices. In either case the device manufacturers offer target devices to end users which include the pipe mechanisms already installed therein.

In option B the pipe provider can provide the pipe mechanisms to end users . The end users may then add the pipe mechanisms to the target devices . For example the device manufacturers can produce a kind of target device that has a mating slot or other type of interface which accommodates the later attachment of a pipe mechanism. An end user may purchase such a target device and then optionally later purchase a pipe mechanism for use in conjunction with the target device. The end user may then couple the pipe mechanism to the target device via the interface that is provided by the target device. Alternatively the end user may remove an existing pipe mechanism that is currently coupled to the target device and replace it with an updated or enhanced version of the pipe mechanism.

The two strategies identified above are cited by way of example not limitation. Still other strategies may be used to supply the pipe mechanisms to entities for use in conjunction with the target devices .

In either of the above cases the entity which hosts the service system the hosting entity can ask the recipient of a pipe mechanism to agree to the terms of a license agreement in order to use the pipe mechanism. For instance the recipient may correspond to a device manufacturer or an end user. In one approach the host entity can request the recipient to pay a single lump sum in order to use a pipe mechanism. This type of license may be the most appropriate option for a device manufacturer. In another case the host entity can request the recipient to pay a periodic fee e.g. a monthly fee to use a pipe mechanism. In another case the host entity can request the recipient to pay a usage based fee to use a pipe mechanism. For example the hosting entity can monitor the amount of data that passes through a pipe mechanism in an upstream and or downstream direction and then compute a monthly fee that is based on this amount.

In another approach the hosting entity can allow the recipients to use the pipe mechanisms without payment of a fee. In this case the hosting entity may provide advertisements to the end users who visit the service system for any reason e.g. to obtain new applications or to configure services. The hosting entity can collect advertising fees from the advertisers. In addition or alternatively the hosting entity can use the advertisements to direct online traffic to other products and services which it offers. Still other approaches are possible by which the hosting entity can monetize the use of the pipe mechanisms even if it does not itself manufacture or distribute the pipe mechanisms .

Returning to the components in this figure will now be described in detail. Starting with the target devices these devices can represent any type of functionality. For example a subset of the target devices may correspond to appliances or other equipment provided in homes. Such target devices encompass lighting mechanisms locks garage door openers automated shades security equipment heaters air conditioning units humidifiers laundry equipment dryers clothes washers etc. kitchen equipment refrigerators stoves ovens fan vents blenders coffee makers etc. bathroom equipment hair dryers electric toothbrushes shaving equipment etc. media equipment televisions music playing equipment etc. game playing equipment toys irrigation equipment pool related equipment and so on. Other target devices correspond to equipment provided in a vehicle of any type. Other target devices correspond to equipment provided in a business environment of any type including a warehouse environment a manufacturing environment a care giving environment e.g. a hospital a government related environment of any type and education related environment of any type and so on. The target devices can encompass yet other types of equipment for use in any environment.

As noted above in some cases the target devices may include dumb equipment that lacks local processor implemented control mechanisms or other facets of local control logic. Processor implemented control mechanisms include for instance microprocessors application specific integrated circuits and so on. A simple light switch is an example of a dumb device. A door lock is another example of a dumb device. In other cases the target devices may include equipment having some local control logic. A security system is an example of a device that may employ some local control logic. In these cases the service system provides services which supplement the local intelligence of the target devices.

As will be described in greater detail below in connection with each pipe mechanism can include a device interface mechanism for interacting with a target device and a service interface mechanism for interacting with the service system . Each pipe mechanism may also include a processing module together with a data store.

The pipe mechanisms may interact with the service system via any communication mechanism such as a wide area network e.g. the Internet a local area network a point to point connection and so on or any combination thereof. More specifically each pipe mechanism can connect to the communication mechanism in different ways. Without limitation a pipe mechanism can connect to the communication mechanism via wireless link s e.g. cellular communication of any type WiFi communication satellite communication etc. and or hardwire link s e.g. a broadband connection of any type a dial up modem connection etc. .

The user devices may correspond to different types of computing units including but not limited to personal computers computer work stations lap top computers tablet type computers personal digital assistant devices mobile telephones of any type e.g. smart phones non mobile telephones of any type electronic book reader devices set top box devices game playing consoles portable game playing devices and so on. The applications may correspond to software implemented logic that can be downloaded from the service system and or elsewhere and stored in data stores provided by the user devices . Alternatively or in addition the applications may correspond to hardware implemented logic provided by the user devices .

The user devices may interact with service system via any communication mechanism such as a wide area network e.g. the Internet a local area network a point to point connection and so on or any combination thereof. More specifically the user devices can connect to the communication mechanism using any of the techniques described above with respect to the communication mechanism . Note that the communication mechanism may represent the same network as the communication mechanism these mechanisms are shown as distinct in to merely facilitate illustration and explanation. 

The service system may correspond to any computer functionality that is accessible via the communication mechanisms . For example the service system may correspond to one or more servers in conjunction with one or more data stores. That is colloquially speaking the service system can be implemented by cloud computing resources that are accessible via the Internet or other wide area network. The components of the service system can be provided at a single site or distributed over plural sites.

The service system hosts a collection of service modules S S . . . S . Each service module in turn provides a service that governs the manner in which a class of target devices operates. For example a first service may provide scheduling logic which turns a type of lighting mechanism on and off at various times during the day. A second service may turn a type of irrigation system on and off at various times during the day. A third service may control a type of oven e.g. by turning it on and off at certain times of the day and setting the cooking temperature to a specified value while in its on state. Many other examples are possible.

In general some services may control target devices by providing binary on off type decisions. In addition or alternatively other services may control target devices by setting values within a continuous range of values or within a discrete set of values as in the above mentioned oven example . Other services may provide yet other types of control instructions to the target devices .

Some services may provide their control without taking into consideration the operational state of the affected target devices. This may be the case for instance for services that control simple light switches. Other services may take the state of the target devices into account. For example consider a service which controls a thermostat. That service may receive a reading from a temperature gauge which reflects the current temperature within a room. In response to this reading the service may increase or decrease the temperature or maintain the temperature at its current value.

Some services may also receive information from external sources meaning sources other than the target devices . For example a service that controls an irrigation system may receive information from a website that provides weather information. The service can take that information into account when controlling the irrigation system e.g. by reducing the amount of water that is applied to a lawn when rain is expected on a particular day.

Although not specifically enumerated in the figure the service system can also provide one or more interfaces that allow the applications to interact with each service module. For example each interface may be implemented as an application programming interface API or the like.

A user may use an application running on the user s device to configure a service in a particular manner. For example a user can interact with a security application to identify the circumstances in which the user s home security system will generate an alarm. The associated service may then interact with the home security system based on the configuration information provided by the user. As noted above a user may find that this method of controlling a device is more efficient and user friendly compared to directly interacting with local control logic provided by the device itself.

More specifically a first communication flow can handle the exchange of information between the pipe mechanisms and the service modules . A second communication flow can handle the exchange of information between the user devices and the service modules . shows an instance of the first and second communication flows in dashed lines. In the second communication flow a user uses an application Aon a user device Uto configure a service S. In the first communication flow the service Ssends control instructions to a device Dvia a pipe P. A controlled device interface module CDIM a device driver module and a user device interface module UDIM implement aspects of the above described first and second communication flows.

More specifically the CDIM can provide different mechanisms for implementing different message transfer protocols. For instance consider a first case in which a pipe mechanism interacts with the service system on a continuous connection basis. The CDIM can accommodate this mode by immediately passing instructions to the pipe mechanism as soon as those instructions are received from the service modules and by immediately passing data to the service modules as soon as that data is received from the pipe mechanism.

Consider a second case in which a pipe mechanism interacts with the service system on an intermittent connection basis. For example the pipe mechanism may connect to the service system every n seconds or minutes or on an event driven basis e.g. when an event occurs that warrants interaction between the pipe mechanism and the service system . The CDIM can accommodate this type of pipe mechanism using a queuing mechanism to store instructions to be passed to the pipe mechanism. When it comes time to establish a connection with the pipe mechanism the CDIM can transfer any outstanding instructions that are provided in its queue to the pipe mechanism.

The CDIM can use a pull based and or push based technique to interact with a pipe mechanism. In a push based technique the CDIM initiates transfer of control instructions to the pipe mechanism. In a pull based technique the CDIM relies on the pipe mechanism to pull the instructions from the service system . Similarly in a push based technique the CDIM relies on the pipe mechanism to push data to the service system . In a pull based technique the CDIM actively pulls data from the pipe mechanism. Still other transfer strategies are possible.

The device driver module provides driver mechanisms that allow the server modules to control different types of target devices . For instance the device driver module may use a first kind of driver mechanism to convert control instructions into an appropriate form for use in controlling a relatively simple lighting mechanism. The device driver module may use a second kind of driver mechanism to convert control instructions into an appropriate form for use in controlling a more complex and versatile lighting switch e.g. a lighting switch which incorporates a dimming function in addition to an on off function. From a high level perspective the device driver module allows each service to be constructed in a device agnostic manner e.g. without taking into account the particular nature of the native functionality provided by the target devices .

The UDIM allows a user to forward information to the services module and allows the service modules to send information to the user. The UDIM can accommodate multiple modes of interconnection in the same manner as the CDIM e.g. by accommodating continuous and intermittent connectivity.

A system management module controls different aspects of the service system . The system management module can perform this function based on information stored in a data store . According to one management function the system management module can establish an association between a particular target device its pipe mechanism and a user account. For example the user account may be associated with a user who owns or is otherwise authorized to control the target device under consideration.

The system management module can use different protocols to establish the above described association. In one non limiting protocol a user who wishes to register a new target device may access the system management module via a user device e.g. by logging onto a web site associated with the system management module . Through that connection the user may 1 identify himself or herself 2 identify the type of target device that is being registered and or 3 identify the pipe mechanism that is coupled to the target device. A user may also connect the target device s pipe mechanism to the service system . Through that connection the pipe mechanism can provide additional identifying information to the service system regarding itself and or the target device. For example the pipe mechanism can transmit one or more identifying codes a digital certificate and or other information which helps authenticate the identity of the pipe mechanism and or the target device. Based on this collected information the system management module may establish a link that relates the target device the pipe mechanism and a user account associated with the user. The system management module can store the collected information in the data store . The user is thereafter permitted to control his or her target device via the service system .

For example consider the particular case in which the pipe mechanism is a permanent part of the new target device. A device manufacturer may convey a code associated with the new target device in paperwork that accompanies the sale of the new target device or by affixing the code to the new target device itself in any manner. In this case it may be sufficient for the user to provide a single code associated with the target device as this code also implicitly identifies the pipe mechanism that is associated with the target device. In another case the pipe mechanism may be an independent component that can be attached to any target device. In this case the user may provide two codes during the registration process a first code associated with the pipe mechanism and a second code associated with the target device.

The system management module may also set up a secure connection with the pipe mechanism using any security mechanism such as but not limited to the Transport Layer Security TLS protocol or the predecessor protocol Secure Sockets Layer SSL . In this protocol the system management module and the pipe mechanism exchange security information to establish a secure connection. Data and instructions may thereafter be transmitted between the service system and the pipe mechanism in a secure form.

Finally the service system may provide an application marketplace . Or a separate system not shown may provide the application marketplace . The application marketplace offers a collection of applications that provide different control functions associated with different types of target devices. For example a user who owns a coffee maker may search the application marketplace for an application that is designed to control this kind of device. The user can then download this application and use it to control his or her coffee maker. Some coffee makers may be more complex than others. Hence the user may seek out an application that is most aptly suited for the kind of coffee maker that he or she owns.

In some cases the target device may already provide the pipe interface mechanism as part of its pre existing legacy design. In other cases a device manufacturer may modify its legacy design to provide the pipe interface mechanism so that the target device can successfully interact with the pipe mechanism .

In the pipe mechanism and the target device are separate components. The pipe mechanism can be detachably connected to the target device at any stage e.g. during assembly of the target device at a manufacturing site or at the end user s site. The pipe mechanism can couple to the pipe interface mechanism using any connection strategy generically denoted in as a connection . For example the connection may represent a plug type outlet that receives a chip type pipe mechanism. Or the connection may represent a cable type connection or a wireless connection and so on.

A separate target device may include any native device functionality and a power interface mechanism . The power interface mechanism of the target device can be coupled to the power interface mechanism of the service controlled switch . In this coupled state the power switch can effectively control the application of power to the target device based on control instructions received by the pipe mechanism . In one particular implementation the service controlled switch comprises a small unit having a male plug that may be inserted into an AC power outlet. The service controlled switch provides a female plug associated with the power interface mechanism for mating with a male plug associated with the power interface mechanism of the target device or vice versa .

More broadly stated is an example of a class of control devices that can control a separate target device in any manner. In another case for example the control device can provide a multi valued output either continuous or discrete based on control instructions received by the pipe mechanism. This kind of control device can control any type of target device that accepts a multi valued input signal such as a thermostat.

More specifically in a first embodiment different classes of pipe mechanisms can be provided that include different types of service interface mechanisms. The different types of service interface mechanisms can handle different types of communications e.g. cellular WiFi etc. and or different transfer strategies e.g. continuous intermittent etc. . A device manufacturer or end user can choose the appropriate class of pipe mechanism for use with a particular type of target device that is to be controlled. In a second implementation a single type of pipe mechanism can be provided that offers a multi mode service interface mechanism where each mode offers a different type of communication and or a different transfer strategy. A device manufacturer or end user can then select the appropriate mode for use with a particular target device to be controlled. For example a device manufacturer can configure the pipe mechanism to provide intermittent WiFi communication with the service system .

The pipe mechanism can also include a processing module that governs it operation. The processing module may correspond to one or more microprocessors and or hardwired logic circuitry. For example the processing module can include transfer logic which governs the transfer of instructions from the service interface mechanism to the device interface mechanism and the flow of data from the device interface mechanism to the service interface mechanism . The processing module can also include security logic for establishing a secure connection with the service system . Other than these types of communication related functions in one implementation the processing module remains agnostic as to the meaning of the information that flows through the pipe mechanism . That is in this case the processing module is not adapted for any particular target device or any particular control function.

The processing module may perform its tasks based on information stored in a data store . For example the data store may store an address associated with the service system such as a URL address. This information allows the pipe mechanism to connect to the service system . Although not shown the data store may also store any kind of identification information such as one or more identification codes security related information certificates etc. The identification information may identify the pipe mechanism . And if the pipe mechanism is a fixed component of a target device the identification information also implicitly identifies the target device. The pipe mechanism may append some of this identification information as a header to data that it forwards to the service system . This will allow the service system to identify the source of the data. The processing module can also receive any identification and or security related information from any source such as the system management module and then store this information in its data store .

The pipe mechanism may optionally incorporate other functions and associated inputs. For example the pipe mechanism can include a connect button or the like. An end user can activate this button to instruct the pipe mechanism to connect to the service system via the communication mechanism .

The computing functionality can include volatile and non volatile memory such as RAM and ROM as well as one or more processing devices e.g. one or more CPUs and or one or more GPUs etc. . The computing functionality also optionally includes various media devices such as a hard disk module an optical disk module and so forth. The computing functionality can perform various operations identified above when the processing device s executes instructions that are maintained by memory e.g. RAM ROM or elsewhere .

More generally instructions and other information can be stored on any computer readable medium including but not limited to static memory storage devices magnetic storage devices optical storage devices and so on. The term computer readable medium also encompasses plural storage devices. In many cases the computer readable medium represents some form of physical and tangible entity. The term computer readable medium also encompasses propagated signals e.g. transmitted or received via physical conduit and or air or other wireless medium etc. However the specific terms computer readable storage medium and computer readable medium device expressly exclude propagated signals per se while including all other forms of computer readable media.

The computing functionality also includes an input output module for receiving various inputs via input devices and for providing various outputs via output devices . Illustrative input devices include a keyboard device a mouse input device a touchscreen input device a gesture input device a voice recognition mechanism tabletop or wall projection input mechanisms and so on. One particular output mechanism may include a presentation device and an associated graphical user interface GUI . The computing functionality can also include one or more network interfaces for exchanging data with other devices via one or more communication conduits . One or more communication buses communicatively couple the above described components together.

The communication conduit s can be implemented in any manner e.g. by a local area network a wide area network e.g. the Internet etc. or any combination thereof. The communication conduit s can include any combination of hardwired links wireless links routers gateway functionality name servers etc. governed by any protocol or combination of protocols.

Alternatively or in addition any of the functions provided by the computing functionality can be performed at least in part by one or more hardware logic components. For example without limitation the computing functionality can be implemented using one or more of Field programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs Application specific Integrated Circuits ASICs Application specific Standard Products ASSPs System on a chip systems SOCs Complex Programmable Logic Devices CPLDs etc.

Starting with this figure shows an illustrative procedure for providing the environment . In block the service system is provided. For instance the service system may be implemented as a cloud computing resource or in some other manner. In block a plurality of device agnostic pipe mechanisms are provided for use in association with respective target devices . sets forth two strategies for accomplishing this task. In block the service system is used to control the target devices via the pipe mechanisms . The operations of can be performed by one or more entities. For example in one representative case a first entity can perform blocks and while a second entity can perform block .

In closing functionality described herein can employ various mechanisms to ensure the privacy of user data maintained by the functionality if any. For example the functionality can allow a user to expressly opt in to and then expressly opt out of the provisions of the functionality. The functionality can also provide suitable security mechanisms to ensure the privacy of the user data such as data sanitizing mechanisms encryption mechanisms password protection mechanisms etc. .
