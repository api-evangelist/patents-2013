E mail marketing campaigns send mass e mails to users. However mass e mails may not be targeted to users in an intelligent manner which may result in a poor click through rate.

The subject technology includes a machine implemented method that provides determining a set of users that have lapsed in usage of an application based on a respective profile of each user determining one or more previous engagement messages sent to the determined set of users ranking a set of engagement types for each user of the determined set of users based on a set of criteria including the determined one or more previous engagement messages selecting an engagement type from among the ranked set of engagement types for each user of the determined set of users generating a new engagement message based on the selected engagement type for each user of the determined set of users and transmitting the generated new engagement message to each user of the determined set of users by utilizing one or more communication channels.

In some configurations determining the set of users that have lapsed is based on a predetermined period of time. Each of the previous engagement messages corresponds to a respective engagement type. The respective engagement type comprises a customized message including graphics text or auto generated content that promotes one or more features of the application. The set of criteria further includes an indication of a number of the previous engagement messages according to engagement type that resulted in a successful engagement by a user. The engagement type is selected based on a highest click through rate among one or more features of the application. The one or more communication channels comprise one of an e mail mobile application notification web application notification push notification or SMS message. The respective profile of each user includes one or more user actions performed in the application. The user actions include Boolean flags that indicate whether a user has used a feature from among the set of features of the application. The application is provided by a web site. The respective profile of each user is stored in a user data store.

The subject technology further includes a system. The system includes memory one or more processors one or more modules stored in memory and configured for execution by the one or more processors. The system includes a user data aggregator module configured to for a set of unique users process application usage logs to determine a set of features of an application accessed by each user of the set of unique users and update a respective profile of each user of the set of unique users based on the determined set of features accessed by the set of unique users. The system further includes an engagement scheduler module configured to determine a set of users that have lapsed in usage of an application based on a respective profile of each user determine one or more previous engagement messages sent to the determined set of users rank a set of engagement types for each user of the determined set of users based on a set of criteria including the determined one or more previous engagement messages and select an engagement type from among the ranked set of engagement types for each user of the determined set of users.

The engagement scheduler module is further configured to generate a new engagement message based on the selected engagement type for each user of the determined set of users. The engagement scheduler module is further configured to transmit the generated new engagement message to each user of the determined set of users by utilizing one or more communication channels.

The subject technology further provides a non transitory machine readable medium including instructions stored therein which when executed by a machine cause the machine to perform operations including determining a set of users that have lapsed in usage of an application based on a respective profile of each user determining one or more previous engagement messages sent to the determined set of users ranking a set of engagement types for each user of the determined set of users based on a set of criteria including the determined one or more previous engagement messages selecting an engagement type from among the ranked set of engagement types for each user of the determined set of users generating a new engagement message based on the selected engagement type for each user of the determined set of users and transmitting the generated new engagement message to each user of the determined set of users by utilizing one or more communication channels.

These and other implementations may provide one or more of the following advantages fewer engagements can be sent to a much more targeted audience and ultimately these engagements become a part of the application experience rather than a one off forced marketing effort. Additionally the subject technology is a fully automated state machine that does not require human defined campaigns and each user receives a customized experience based on his or her usage of the application over time. Furthermore the subject technology utilizes feedback channels to automatically learn a better strategy to engage each individual user over time.

It is understood that other configurations of the subject technology will become readily apparent from the following detailed description where various configurations of the subject technology are shown and described by way of illustration. As will be realized the subject technology is capable of other and different configurations and its several details are capable of modification in various other respects all without departing from the scope of the subject technology. Accordingly the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.

The detailed description set forth below is intended as a description of various configurations of the subject technology and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the subject technology may be practiced. The appended drawings are incorporated herein and constitute a part of the detailed description. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the subject technology. However the subject technology is not limited to the specific details set forth herein and may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the subject technology.

In a given online social network system the online social network system may send out a vast number emails e.g. hundreds of millions to users that are lapsed and have not logged in or utilized the online social network system in a predetermined period of time e.g. a week several weeks months etc. . Such e mails may promote the online social network system to attempt to entice the users to log into the system e.g. by clicking on a link provided in the e mail and or utilize one or more features of the system. However such e mails are not targeted in an intelligent way for each user which may result in poor click through rate for the e mails. For example an existing system may not utilize certain information about each user to target users in a more effective manner.

Application usage logs may include activity per user in an online social network system. In some configurations the subject technology utilizes per user information from such usage logs to more optimally target engagement messages for each user and determine a type of engagement message to send to each user in an automated way. As used herein an engagement message may be any system generated communication with a user across one or more communication channels including but not limited to e mail in application notifications in a web application and or push notifications to a mobile device that has a mobile application installed on the mobile device. Other types of communication channels and message types may be utilized and still be within the scope of the subject technology.

In some configurations the subject technology provides N different engagement types that may be understood as customized interface templates including content e.g. text images etc. as well as including machine defined content e.g. posts that may be interesting for a specific user suggested people or contacts to connect with etc. . Each engagement message therefore may correspond to an engagement type. A profile is generated for each unique user based on each user s activity in the online social network system as included in the usage logs. Further the subject technology may keep a historical record of past engagement messages and or types that have been sent to each user. In this manner the subject technology can utilize the historical record of past engagement messages types to filter out one or more previously sent engagement types.

Based on information in the application usage logs for each unique user user profile information historical record of past engagement messages already sent and or other criteria the subject technology ranks the N different engagement types and selects an engagement type based on the ranking. The subject technology may then send an engagement message according to the selected engagement type to a set of users that have been determined to have lapsed in an online social network system. Although the above description describes an online social network system it should be appreciated that the configurations described herein may be applicable to improving the utilization of any application by effectively targeting users with engagement messages.

In some implementations users may be provided with an opportunity to determine how programs or features use user information or to determine whether and or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition in some implementations user information can be processed to obscure identity.

The system can include memory one or more processors and one or more modules stored in memory and configured for execution by the one or more processors. As shown in the system includes several modules for providing different functionality. The system is configured to include a user data aggregator module and an engagement scheduler module .

As illustrated in application usage logs is a data store that stores usage logs which records user activity from a web application and a mobile application . For instance when a user performs an activity or action within the web application or the mobile application the activity is recorded into the application usage logs e.g. page visits user actions activity with corresponding timestamps etc. . User actions may include page visits or asynchronous actions e.g. JavaScript calls when a user presses a button on a given page . In an example in which the web application and the mobile application provide an interface for a given online social networking service each activity recorded in the application usage logs may correspond to different features in the online social network service such as but not limited to creating new posts messages sharing content updating a user s profile and the information stored therein adding contacts viewing contacts creating a group that shares common interests or affiliations etc. Other types of features may be included and still be within the scope of the subject technology.

Additionally other user activity corresponding to other types of applications may be stored in the application usage logs and still be within the scope of the subject technology. For example user activity from applications running on tablet devices touch sensitive devices notebooks netbooks televisions or wearable computing devices may be stored in the application usage logs .

In some configurations the user data aggregator module is configured continuously iterate over all unique users in the application usage logs and update a profile for each user. More specifically the user data aggregator module is configured to for a set of unique users process application usage logs to determine a set of features of an application accessed by each user of the set of unique users and update a respective profile of each user of the set of unique users based on the determined set of features accessed by the set of unique users. In one example each profile of a unique user may include Boolean flags that indicate whether a user has used a given feature in the online social network system or application. With respect to covering features in the online social network system or application the subject technology is extensible by allowing new or additional features to be added as long as such features are based on information stored in the application usage logs . In one example each user profile is stored in a separate data store shown as a user data store in .

In some configurations the engagement scheduler module is configured to utilize data in the user data store as targeting and ranking criteria to decide an optimal engagement type e.g. from among the N engagement types to send to a given user at a given time. In one example the engagement scheduler module is configured to utilize the data in the user data store to filter out one or more engagement types that are no longer applicable to this user for example engagements that teach a user about a given feature should never be sent to users who have already used that feature successfully . Given N matching engagement types for a given user the engagement scheduler module is configured to select the optimal engagement type to send to the user based on a ranking algorithm. This ranking algorithm is a function that includes but is not limited to historical engagements sent to the current user historical success rates of the N engagement types across various types of audiences manually defined prioritization of engagement types etc. As illustrated in the engagement scheduler module may transmit a system generated e mail and or in app notification to the web application and or the mobile application .

In one example the engagement scheduler module is configured to determine a set of users that have lapsed in usage of an application based on a respective profile of each user determine one or more previous engagement messages sent to the determined set of users rank a set of engagement types for each user of the determined set of users based on a set of criteria including the determined one or more previous engagement messages and select an engagement type from among the ranked set of engagement types for each user of the determined set of users. Additionally the engagement scheduler module is further configured to generate a new engagement message based on the selected engagement type for each user of the determined set of users and transmit the generated new engagement message to each user of the determined set of users by utilizing one or more communication channels.

Each of the aforementioned modules illustrated in may be configured to communicate between each other. For instance different data messages API calls and returns can be passed between the different modules in the system . Also the system may communicate over a network to request and or receive data from the web application or the mobile application .

The process at begins for a set of unique users by processing application usage logs to determine a set of features of an application accessed by each user of the set of unique users. The application is provided by a web site with the set of features in one example or may be a mobile application that may access a web site that provides the set of features. In one example the application usage logs are stored at a plurality of disparate data sources across a network. The application usage logs include for instance one or more entries of user actions performed in the application. By way of example the application usage logs further include respective timestamps for the user actions performed in the application and a count of a number of times the user actions were performed. The user actions may include Boolean flags that indicate whether a user has used a feature from among the set of features of the application. Further the application usage logs further include respective timestamps of page visits to the web site in some configurations.

The process at updates a respective profile of each user of the set of unique users based on the determined set of features accessed by the set of unique users. The respective profile of each user is stored in a user data store in one example. For new users of the application a profile may not yet exist. In these instances a new user profile may be created. The process for example determines if an existing profile exists for a respective user of the set of unique users creates a new profile if the existing profile does not exist for the respective user and stores the determined set of features accessed by the respective user in the new profile.

The process begins at by determining a set of users that have lapsed in usage of an application based on a respective profile of each user. In some configurations determining the set of users that have lapsed is based on a predetermined period of time. In one example the respective profile of each user includes one or more user actions performed in the application and or a respective timestamp for each user action and the user actions may be represented as Boolean flags that indicate whether a user has used a feature from among a set of features of the application.

At the process determines if any users have lapsed based on the determination at . If not the process then ends. Alternatively if the process determines the set of users that have lapsed the process continues to .

The process at determines a history of previous engagement messages sent to the determined set of users. In some configurations the history of previous engagement messages also includes a timestamp of each previous engagement message which is used in ranking e.g. the N engagement types receive a penalty proportional to the time elapsed since the last engagement message of that type was sent to the user . In one example each of the previous engagement messages corresponds to a respective engagement type. For instance the respective engagement type may be a customized message including graphics text or auto generated content that promotes one or more features of the application.

The process at ranks a set of engagement types for each user of the determined set of users based on a set of criteria including the determined history of previous engagement messages. In one example the set of criteria further includes an indication of a number of the previous engagement messages according to engagement type that resulted in a successful engagement e.g. click through user logs into the system and accesses the promoted feature s etc. by a user. Previous engagement messages corresponding to respective engagement types that have been sent to the user s may be ranked lower than a particular engagement type s that has yet or never been sent to the user. In addition as previously mentioned a timestamp of each previous engagement message may be utilized in ranking by assigning a penalty proportional to the time elapsed since the last engagement message corresponding to a respective engagement type was sent to the user. Other types of criteria may be utilized and still be within the scope of the subject technology.

The process at selects an engagement type from among the ranked set of engagement types for each user of the determined set of users. In one example the engagement type is selected based on a highest click through rate among one or more features of the application. In another example the engagement type is selected based on a respective engagement type with a highest rank or score from among all of the engagement types. For instance a respective engagement type that has yet to be sent to the user e.g. based on the history of previous engagement messages may be the highest ranked engagement type in one example and thus be selected. The process at generates a new engagement message based on the selected engagement type for each user of the determined set of users.

The process at transmits the generated new engagement message to each user of the determined set of users by utilizing one or more communication channels. By way of example the one or more communication channels may include at least one of an e mail mobile application notification web application notification push notification or SMS message. The process then ends.

Many of the above described features and applications are implemented as software processes that are specified as a set of instructions recorded on a non transitory machine readable storage medium also referred to as computer readable medium . When these instructions are executed by one or more processing unit s e.g. one or more processors cores of processors or other processing units they cause the processing unit s to perform the actions indicated in the instructions. Examples of machine readable media include but are not limited to CD ROMs flash drives RAM chips hard drives EPROMs disk drives etc. The machine readable media does not include carrier waves and electronic signals passing wirelessly or over wired connections.

In this specification the term software includes firmware residing in read only memory and or applications stored in magnetic storage which can be read into memory for processing by a processor. Also in some implementations multiple software components can be implemented as sub parts of a larger program while remaining distinct software components. In some implementations multiple software subject components can also be implemented as separate programs. Finally a combination of separate programs that together implement a software component s described here is within the scope of the subject technology. In some implementations the software programs when installed to operate on one or more systems define one or more specific machine implementations that execute and perform the operations of the software programs.

A computer program also known as a program software software application script or code can be written in a form of programming language including compiled or interpreted languages declarative or procedural languages and it can be deployed in some form including as a stand alone program or as a module component subroutine object or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program may but need not correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data e.g. one or more scripts stored in a markup language document in a single file dedicated to the program in question or in multiple coordinated files e.g. files that store one or more modules sub programs or portions of code . A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.

Some configurations are implemented as software processes that include one or more application programming interfaces APIs in an environment with calling program code interacting with other program code being called through the one or more interfaces. Various function calls messages or other types of invocations which can include various kinds of parameters can be transferred via the APIs between the calling program and the code being called. In addition an API can provide the calling program code the ability to use data types or classes defined in the API and implemented in the called program code.

The following description describes an example system in which aspects of the subject technology can be implemented.

The bus collectively represents all system peripheral and chipset buses that communicatively connect the numerous internal devices of the system . For instance the bus communicatively connects the processing unit s with the read only memory the system memory and the storage device .

From these various memory units the processing unit s retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of the subject technology. The processing unit s can be a single processor or a multi core processor in different implementations.

The read only memory ROM stores static data and instructions that are needed by the processing unit s and other modules of the system . The storage device on the other hand is a read and write memory device. This device is a non volatile memory unit that stores instructions and data even when the system is off. Some implementations of the subject technology use a mass storage device such as a magnetic or optical disk and its corresponding disk drive as the storage device .

Other implementations use a removable storage device such as a flash drive a floppy disk and its corresponding disk drive as the storage device . Like the storage device the system memory is a read and write memory device. However unlike storage device the system memory is a volatile read and write memory such a random access memory. The system memory stores some of the instructions and data that the processor needs at runtime. In some implementations the subject technology s processes are stored in the system memory the storage device and or the read only memory . For example the various memory units include instructions for processing multimedia items in accordance with some implementations. From these various memory units the processing unit s retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of some implementations.

The bus also connects to the optional input and output interfaces and . The optional input interface enables the user to communicate information and select commands to the system. The optional input interface can interface with alphanumeric keyboards and pointing devices also called cursor control devices . The optional output interface can provide display images generated by the system . The optional output interface can interface with printers and display devices such as cathode ray tubes CRT or liquid crystal displays LCD . Some implementations can interface with devices such as a touchscreen that functions as both input and output devices.

Finally as shown in bus also couples system to a network interface through a network adapter not shown . In this manner the computer can be a part of a network of computers such as a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN or an Intranet or an interconnected network of networks such as the Internet. The components of system can be used in conjunction with the subject technology.

These functions described above can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry in computer software firmware or hardware. The techniques can be implemented using one or more computer program products. Programmable processors and computers can be included in or packaged as mobile devices. The processes and logic flows can be performed by one or more programmable processors and by one or more programmable logic circuitry. General and special purpose computing devices and storage devices can be interconnected through communication networks.

Some implementations include electronic components such as microprocessors storage and memory that store computer program instructions in a non transitory machine readable or non transitory computer readable medium alternatively referred to as computer readable storage media machine readable media or machine readable storage media . Some examples of such computer readable media include RAM ROM read only compact discs CD ROM recordable compact discs CD R rewritable compact discs CD RW read only digital versatile discs e.g. DVD ROM dual layer DVD ROM a variety of recordable rewritable DVDs e.g. DVD RAM DVD RW DVD RW etc. flash memory e.g. SD cards mini SD cards micro SD cards etc. magnetic and or solid state hard drives read only and recordable Blu Ray discs ultra density optical discs optical or magnetic media and floppy disks. The computer readable media can store a computer program that is executable by at least one processing unit and includes sets of instructions for performing various operations. Examples of computer programs or computer code include machine code such as is produced by a compiler and files including higher level code that are executed by a computer an electronic component or a microprocessor using an interpreter.

While the above discussion primarily refers to microprocessor or multi core processors that execute software some implementations are performed by one or more integrated circuits such as application specific integrated circuits ASICs or field programmable gate arrays FPGAs . In some implementations such integrated circuits execute instructions that are stored on the circuit itself.

As used in this specification and the claims of this application the terms computer server processor and memory all refer to electronic or other technological devices. These terms exclude people or groups of people. For the purposes of the specification the terms display or displaying means displaying on an electronic device. As used in this specification and the claims of this application the terms computer readable medium and computer readable media are entirely restricted to non transitory tangible physical objects that store information in a form that is readable by a computer. These terms exclude wireless signals wired download signals and other ephemeral signals.

To provide for interaction with a user implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a computer having a display device e.g. a CRT cathode ray tube or LCD liquid crystal display monitor for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device e.g. a mouse or a trackball by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well for example feedback provided to the user can be a form of sensory feedback e.g. visual feedback auditory feedback or tactile feedback and input from the user can be received in a form including acoustic speech or tactile input. In addition a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used by the user for example by sending web pages to a web browser on a user s client device in response to requests received from the web browser.

Configurations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component e.g. as a data server or that includes a middleware component e.g. an application server or that includes a front end component e.g. a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification or a combination of one or more such back end middleware or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by a form or medium of digital data communication e.g. a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network LAN and a wide area network WAN an inter network e.g. the Internet and peer to peer networks e.g. ad hoc peer to peer networks .

The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client server relationship to each other. In some configurations a server transmits data e.g. an HTML page to a client device e.g. for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device . Data generated at the client device e.g. a result of the user interaction can be received from the client device at the server.
