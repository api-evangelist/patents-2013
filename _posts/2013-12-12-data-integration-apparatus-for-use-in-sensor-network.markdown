This application claims priority to Taiwan Patent Application No. 102145104 filed on Dec. 9 2013 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The present invention relates to a data integration apparatus for use in a sensor network. More particularly the data integration apparatus for use in a sensor network provided by the present invention accesses tabled data of the sensor network by using text commands and hardware configuration settings to accomplish the communication between an application and the sensor network.

In conventional sensing applications a sensor or a controller is adapted to a host board where a sensing application is loaded via mainly a sensor adapter board of a particular specification and through a bus. When an application is developed the sensor provider must provide the associated application developer with an application programming interface for communicating with the host board driving program so as to perform the sensing. For different sensing development environments and program development languages various different sets of application interfaces are needed to develop a plurality of sensing applications.

If the aforesaid host board is placed into a sensor network architecture then it becomes a network node. Each network node connects to a primary node via mainly a wireless or wired communication protocol. The primary node is connected to the host board where the sensing application is loaded via an adapter board of a particular specification e.g. a universal asynchronous receiver transmitter UART .

A user can execute an application associated with a single sensor on one node to communicate with the host board driving program and perform operations associated with the sensor via the sensor adapter board and the network node. However in cases where the sensor network architecture is not supported by the application interface the support of the host board and the primary node and the communication between the host board and the sensing network need to be taken into consideration when the application is developed in order to communicate with the sensor successfully when the application is executed.

Further sensors network nodes and sensor adapter boards produced by different sensor manufactures usually have different specifications. Therefore how to make further interpretations for different data contents generated by the sensor adapter boards the network nodes of different specifications and the buses therebetween also needs to be taken in to consideration during development of the application.

Accordingly not only each sensor provider must expand their application interfaces additionally to the network level but also multiple sets of application interfaces need to be prepared according to various different networks different development environments and different development languages. Therefore the conventional application interfaces represent a great burden to the sensor providers. Moreover the need of developing the sensing network applications via different application interfaces makes the development of the sensing network applications quite inconvenient and inflexible.

Accordingly an urgent need exists in the art to provide a solution capable of improving the sensing data processing manner based on the existing sensor network hardware architecture so as to accelerate the development of the application and improve the flexibility in use of the application.

A primary objective of certain embodiments of the present invention is to provide a data integration apparatus for use in a sensor network system. The sensor network system comprises a sensor network and an application server. The data integration apparatus comprises a resource allocation module a data interface processing unit a resource attribute processing unit a logic bus processing unit and a network interface processing unit. The resource allocation module is stored with a sensor resource profile a bus profile a resource bus mapping profile and a network node profile.

The data interface processing unit connected with the application server is configured to receive a sensor query command from the application server query the sensor resource profile according to the sensor query command and retrieve a sensor type configuration from the sensor resource profile and transmit a sensor bus query command according to the sensor type configuration. The resource attribute processing unit is configured to query the resource bus mapping profile according to the sensor bus query command and retrieve a bus mapping configuration from the resource bus mapping profile query the bus profile according to the bus mapping configuration and retrieve a bus type configuration from the bus profile and transmit a network node query command according to the bus type configuration.

The network interface processing unit connected with the sensor network is configured to access the sensor network according to the network node mapping configuration and transmit a query response back to the application serve. The query response comprises a network node identification code and a piece of network node sensor information.

The detailed technology and preferred embodiments implemented for the subject invention are described in the following paragraphs accompanying the appended drawings for people skilled in this field to well appreciate the features of the claimed invention.

In the following description certain embodiments of the present invention will be explained with reference to example embodiments thereof. However these example embodiments are not intended to limit the present invention to any specific examples embodiments environment applications or particular implementations described in these example embodiments.

The sensor network system comprises a data integration apparatus an application server and a sensor network . The data integration apparatus comprises a resource allocation module and a data processing module . The data processing module is connected with the application server and the sensor network . The resource allocation module is stored with a sensor configuration . Interactions between individual network elements will be further described hereinafter.

Firstly when a user wants to perform operations of the sensor network via a sensor application of the application server the user needs to query about available sensors of the sensor network firstly. Therefore the user may transmit a sensor query command via the application server . Subsequently the data processing module accesses the sensor configuration according to the sensor query command after receiving the sensor query command from the application server .

It should be appreciated that the resource allocation module may be selected from data storage elements of various forms e.g. a memory a hard disc and the like . The sensor configuration mainly records the configuration data associated with the sensors of the sensor network . The configuration data associated with the sensors are updated each time it is accessed. In this way the data processing module can know a state of the sensor network by accessing the sensor configuration and further query the sensor network . Then the data processing module can obtain a query response and transmit the query response back to the application server to accomplish the communication between the application server and the sensor network .

Referring to it is a schematic view of a sensor network system according to a second embodiment of the present invention. The sensor network system comprises a data integration apparatus an application server and a sensor network . The data integration apparatus comprises a resource allocation module a data interface processing unit a resource attribute processing unit a logic bus processing unit and a network interface processing unit . The data interface processing unit is connected with the application server and the network interface is connected with the sensor network . It should be appreciated that the aforesaid processing units may be implemented by the same processing unit hardware or by different processing unit hardware.

The resource allocation module is stored with a sensor resource profile RP a bus profile BP a resource bus mapping profile MP and a network node profile NP. The sensor resource profile RP records information related to the sensors the bus profile BP records information related to the bus the resource bus mapping profile MP records information related to the resource bus mapping the network node profile NP records information related to the network node and the output input and the contents of the network node profile NP are updated after each query. Interactions between individual elements will be further described hereafter.

Firstly when a user wants to perform operations of the sensor network via the sensor application of the application server the user needs to query about available sensors of the sensor network . Therefore the user may transmit a sensor query command via the application server . Subsequently the data interface processing unit receives the sensor query command queries the sensor resource profile RP according to the sensor query command and retrieves a sensor type configuration SEN from the sensor resource profile RP.

It should be appreciated that the sensor resource profile RP records the sensor type configuration SEN which indicates that a network node in the senor network is provided with a sensor associated with the sensor type configuration SEN. Then the data interface processing unit can transmit a sensor bus query command according to the sensor type configuration SEN to confirm what kind of bus is used by the sensor associated with the sensor type configuration SEN.

Specifically the resource attribute processing unit then queries the resource bus mapping profile MP according to the sensor bus query command and retrieves a bus mapping configuration RBP from the resource bus mapping profile. The bus mapping configuration RBP records the bus used by the sensor type configuration SEN.

Accordingly the resource attribute processing unit can further query the bus profile BP according to the bus mapping configuration RBP to retrieve a bus type configuration BUS associated with the sensor type configuration SEN from the bus profile BP. Subsequently the resource attribute processing unit transmits a network node query command according to the bus type configuration BUS.

Then the logic bus processing unit transmits a node support query command according to the network node query command . Finally the network interface processing unit queries the sensor network according to the node support query command and transmits a query response to the application server . The query response comprises a network node identification code id and a piece of network node sensor information TYPE. In this way the communication between the application server and the sensor network is accomplished by the data integration apparatus .

For ease of understanding the aforesaid operation process will be illustrated by an example. Likewise when the user wants to perform the operations of the sensor network via the sensor application of the application server the user needs to query about the available sensors of the sensor network. Therefore the user can transmit a sensor query command SELECT FROM ida info via the application server to query what kind of sensor is supported by the sensor network.

Subsequently the data interface processing unit receives the sensor query command SELECT FROM ida info and queries the sensor resource profile RAA according to the sensor query command SELECT FROM ida info . The sensor resource profile RAA is an embodiment of the RP in as follows 

Since the sensor resource profile RAA has a configuration setting associated with a carbon dioxide sensor recorded therein it indicates that there is a node provided with a carbon dioxide sensor in the sensor network. Therefore the data interface unit retrieves a sensor type configuration CO2S from the sensor resource profile RAA.

Then the data interface processing unit issues a sensor bus query command RAA.CO2S L to the resource attribute processing unit according to the sensor type configuration CO2S retrieved so as to confirm what kind of bus is used by the sensor associated with the sensor CO2S. The resource attribute processing unit then queries the resource bus mapping profile Mapping according to the sensor bus query command RAA. CO2S L . The resource bus mapping profile Mapping is an embodiment of the MP in as follows 

Accordingly the resource attribute processing unit retrieves the bus mapping configuration CO2S.GPIO from the resource bus mapping profile Mapping and the bus mapping configuration CO2S.GPIO records that a universal output input bus is used corresponding to the sensor type configuration CO2S.

Accordingly the resource attribute processing unit can further query the bus profile LBA according to the bus mapping configuration GPIO. The bus profile LBA is an embodiment of the BP in as follows 

Thus a bus type configuration GPIO associated with the sensor type configuration CO2S is retrieved from the bus profile LBA. Subsequently the resource attribute processing unit transmits a network node query command LBA.GPIO L according to the bus type configuration GPIO.

Then the logic bus processing unit transmits a node support query command list to the network interface processing unit according to the network node query command LBA.GPIO L . The network interface processing unit transmits a query response NodeID CO2S back to the application server via the aforesaid query processing path according to the node support query command list . The NodeID CO2S indicates that the network node NodeID is provided with the sensor CO2S and the NodeID will be recorded in the network node profile for node management after the response to the query is made for example when the node joins in or leaves or the contents of the NodeID will be updated after each query.

It should be particularly appreciated that the aforesaid commands used between the sensor network and the application server of the present invention are similar to commands of a database. The commands are decomposed into text commands of the present invention to accomplish the communication between the application server and the sensing network by querying the respective configuration database according to the text commands. In this way the present invention can accomplish the communication between different application servers and the sensor network by simply adjusting the configurations in the database without the need of rewriting a new program and a corresponding API as in the prior art.

Then referring to it is a schematic view of a sensor network system according to a third embodiment of the present invention. The system architecture and the network connection environment in the third embodiment are the same as those in the previous embodiments so elements with the same reference numerals also have the same functions and will not be further described herein. However the third embodiment is different from the previous embodiments in that the operations performed on the sensor after the sensor configuration in the sensor network is queried are described in the third embodiment.

Firstly the user has known via the application server that a sensor associated with the sensor information TYPE exists in the sensor network in the third embodiment. Therefore the user can transmit a sensor attribute query command via the application server . In other words the data interface processing unit receives the sensor attribute query command from the application server and queries the sensor resource profile RP according to the sensor attribute query command .

Since the sensor resource profile RP further has an operation command of the sensor associated with the sensor information TYPE recorded therein the data interface processing unit can retrieve a piece of sensor attribute information PTY from the sensor resource profile RP and transmit the sensor attribute information PTY back to the application server . In this way the user can know the operation functions of the sensor associated with the sensor information TYPE through the sensor attribute information PTY.

For ease of understanding the aforesaid operation process will also be illustrated by an example. As in the example of the third embodiment the user has known via the application server that the sensor CO2S exists in the sensor network. Therefore the user can transmit the sensor attribute query command SELECT FROM ida CO2S via the application server. The data interface processing unit receives the sensor attribute query command SELECT FROM ida CO2S and queries the sensor resource profile RAA accordingly.

The sensor resource profile RAA further has the attribute and the operation command of the sensor associated with the sensor CO2S recorded therein that is an embodiment of the RP in may comprise the attribute and the operation command of the sensor 

Therefore the data interface processing unit can retrieve a piece of sensor attribute information co2 ppm Read from the sensor resource profile RAA and transmit the sensor attribute information co2 ppm Read back to the application server. In this way the user can know from the sensor attribute information co2 ppm Read that the sensor CO2S has the operation of reading co2 ppm .

In the third embodiment the sensor associated with the sensor information TYPE has the basic reading writing function. Accordingly when the user wants to read the sensor associated with the sensor information TYPE and having a network node identification code id the data interface processing unit receives a sensor attribute reading command from the application server for the network node identification node id and the sensor attribute information PTY.

Then the data interface processing unit queries the sensor resource profile RP according to the sensor attribute reading command and retrieves a sensor attribute configuration AccessRead from the sensor resource profile RP. Subsequently the data interface processing unit transmits a sensor bus output input query command according to the sensor attribute configuration AccessRead . The resource attribute processing unit then queries the resource bus mapping profile MP according to the sensor bus output input query command and retrieves the bus mapping configuration RBP from the resource bus mapping profile MP.

Subsequently the resource attribute processing unit queries the bus profile BP according to the bus mapping configuration RBP and retrieves a bus output input configuration IO from the bus profile BP. The bus output input configuration IO records an output input state of the bus. Then the resource attribute processing unit transmits a network node reading command according to the bus output input configuration IO.

The logic bus processing unit queries a network node profile NP according to the network node reading command and retrieves a memory address add from the network node profile NP. Subsequently the logic bus processing unit issues a network node reading command according to the memory address add. For the network node represented by the network node identification code id the network interface processing unit reads a data table provided by the memory of the network node at the memory address add according to the network node reading command to obtain a sensor numeric value value and transmits the sensor numeric value value back to the application server .

For ease of understanding the aforesaid operation process will be illustrated by an example hereafter. As in the previous example the sensor CO2S has the basic reading function of co2 ppm Read. Accordingly when the user wants to read the co2 ppm numeric value of the sensor CO2S disposed at the network node NodeID the data interface processing unit receives the sensor attribute reading command SELECT co2 ppm FROM ida CO2S WHERE device NodeID from the application server. The NodeID is a NodeID that has known by querying.

Then the data interface processing unit queries the sensor resource profile RAA according to the sensor attribute reading command SELECT co2 ppm FROM ida CO2S WHERE device NodeID and retrieves a sensor attribute configuration co2 ppm .

Subsequently the data interface processing unit transmits the sensor bus output input query command RAA.CO2S i co2 ppm s NodeID according to the sensor attribute configuration co2 ppm . The resource attribute processing unit then queries the resource bus mapping profile Mapping according to the sensor bus output input query command RAA.CO2S i co2 ppm s NodeID 

The resource attribute processing unit further retrieves a bus output input configuration GPIO.AI from the bus profile LBA. Then the resource attribute processing unit transmits the network node reading command LBA GPIO i AI0 s NodeID according to the bus output input configuration GPIO.AI.

The logic bus processing unit queries the network node profile TBA according to the network node reading command LBA GPIO i AI0 s NodeID 

The logic bus processing unit further retrieves a memory address 0x41 and memory length 32 from the network node profile TBA. Subsequently the logic bus processing unit issues a network node reading command read 0x41 0 32 according to the memory address 0x41. For the network node NodeID the network interface processing unit reads data starting from relative memory address 0 with length 32 of the data table of the network node NodeID at the memory address 0x41 according to the network node reading command read 0x41 0 32 to obtain a sensor numeric value ppm and transmits the sensor numeric value ppm back to the application server.

On the other hand when the user wants to write in or update the attribute of the sensor associated with the sensor information TYPE and having the network node identification code id the data interface processing unit receives a sensor attribute writing command from the application server for the network node identification code id and the sensor attribute information PTY.

Then the data interface processing unit queries the sensor resource profile RP according to the sensor attribute writing command and retrieves a sensor attribute configuration AccessWrite from the sensor resource profile RP. Subsequently the data interface processing unit transmits a sensor bus output input query command according to the sensor attribute configuration AccessWrite . The resource attribute processing unit then queries the resource bus mapping profile MP according to the sensor bus output input query command and retrieves the bus mapping configuration RBP from the resource bus mapping profile MP.

Subsequently the data attribute processing unit queries the bus profile BP according to the bus mapping configuration RBP and retrieves the bus output input configuration IO from the bus profile BP. The bus output input configuration IO records an output input state of the bus. Then the data attribute processing unit transmits a network node writing command according to the bus output input configuration IO.

The logic bus processing unit queries the network node profile NP according to the network node writing command and retrieves a memory address add from the network node profile NP. Subsequently the logic bus processing unit issues a network node writing command according to the memory address add. For the network node represented by the network node identification node id the network interface processing unit writes the data into the data table provided by the memory of the network node at the memory address add according to the network node writing command obtains a writing response ack and transmits the writing response ack back to the application server .

For ease of understanding the aforesaid operation process will also be illustrated by an example. As in the previous example the sensor CO2S has a basic writing function of altitude Write . Accordingly when the user wants to writes in an altitude numeric value for the sensor CO2S disposed at the network node NodeID the data interface processing unit receives the sensor attribute writing command UPDATE ida CO2S SET altitude 300 WHERE device NodeID from the application server.

Then the data interface processing unit queries the sensor resource profile RAA according to the sensor attribute reading command UPDATE ida CO2S SET altitude 300 WHERE device NodeID . The sensor resource profile RAA is as follows 

The data interface processing unit can retrieve the sensor attribute configuration altitude from the sensor resource profile RAA.

Subsequently the data interface processing unit transmits the sensor bus output input query command RAA.CO2S u altitude 300 s NodeID according to the sensor attribute configuration altitude . The resource attribute processing unit then queries the resource bus mapping profile Mapping according to the sensor bus output input query command RAA.CO2S u altitude 300 s NodeID and retrieves the bus mapping configuration CO2S.GPIO from the resource bus mapping profile Mapping and attribute altitude identified as A02 corresponding to location 32 of port P02 of GPIO. Subsequently the resource attribute processing unit queries the bus profile LBA according to the bus mapping configuration CO2S.GPIO. The bus profile LBA is as follows 

The data attribute processing unit further retrieves a bus output input configuration GPIO.AO from the bus profile LBA. Then the data attribute processing unit transmits the network node writing command LBA.GPIO u AO32 300 s NodeID according to the bus output input configuration GPIO.AO.

The logic bus processing unit queries the network node profile TBA according to the network node reading command LBA.GPIO u AO32 300 s NodeID . The network node profile TBA is as follows 

The logic bus processing unit further retrieves the memory address 0x51 from the network node profile TBA. Subsequently the logic bus processing unit issues the network node writing command write 0x51 32 1 300 according to the memory address 0x51 while 1 means the number of the data. For the network node NodeID the network interface processing unit writes the numeric value 300 into the started location 32 of the data table provided by the memory of the network node NodeID at the memory address 0x51 according to the network node writing command write 0x51 32 1 300 obtains the writing response ack and transmits the writing response ack back to the application server.

Likewise each of the aforesaid commands received by the data interface processing unit from the application server may also be a command for multiple network nodes multiple sensors and multiple attribute values for example UPDATE ida CO2S ida ISKT SET altitude 300 power ON WHERE device NodeID1 device NodeID2 . This can be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art based on the above disclosure and thus the detailed operations will be not further described herein.
