As the hybrid exhaust gas turbocharger a hybrid exhaust gas turbocharger is known which includes a turbine portion that is driven by exhaust gas introduced from an internal combustion engine a compressor portion that is driven by the turbine portion to forcibly feed outside air to the internal combustion engine and a casing that supports the turbine portion and the compressor portion and in which a muffler that is connected to an intake system of the internal combustion engine and is supported by the casing via the compressor portion is provided on an upstream side of the compressor portion a shell housing having a recess in an inner portion of the housing is provided at a center portion of the muffler and a generator is accommodated in the recess for example PTL 1 .

In the hybrid exhaust gas turbocharger disclosed in PTL 1 a high speed induction generator is adopted which includes a rotary shaft having a permanent magnet adhering to the outer circumferential surface of the rotary shaft and a stator coil disposed along an axial direction and a circumferential direction to surround an outside in a radial direction of the permanent magnet. Moreover it is considered that a movement in the axial direction of the rotary shaft is restrained by a suction force generated between the permanent magnet and the stator coil. Accordingly in the generator of the hybrid exhaust gas turbocharger disclosed in PTL 1 a restraint mechanism that restrains the movement in the axial direction of the rotary shaft is not required.

However when the hybrid exhaust gas turbocharger disclosed in PTL 1 is mounted on the internal combustion engine if vibration generated in the internal combustion engine is increased the rotary shaft of the generator is moved to a large extent in the axial direction due to the vibration a load is applied to a flexible coupling which connects the rotary shaft of the generator and the rotary shafts of the turbine portion and the compressor portion and as a result the flexible coupling is damaged and there is a concern that components in the supercharger may be damaged.

The present invention is made to solve the above described problems and to provide a hybrid exhaust gas turbocharger capable of preventing the supercharger from being damaged due to a rotary shaft of a generator being moved to a large extent in an axial direction by vibration generated from the internal combustion engine and a rotary portion in contact with a stationary portion in the supercharger when the supercharger is mounted on the internal combustion engine.

According to the hybrid exhaust gas turbocharger of the first aspect of the present invention a movement in an axial direction of the rotary shaft of the generator accommodated in the recess of the shell housing is restrained by the restraint mechanism.

Accordingly when the hybrid exhaust gas turbocharger is mounted on the internal combustion engine the supercharger can be prevented from being damaged due to the rotary shaft of the generator being moved to a large extent in the axial direction by vibration generated from the internal combustion engine and a rotary portion in contact with a stationary portion in the supercharger.

In addition a generator other than a high speed induction generator may be adopted as the generator that is accommodated in the recess of the shell housing.

According to the hybrid exhaust gas turbocharger as the generator accommodated in the recess of the shell housing the high speed induction generator is adopted which includes a rotary shaft having the permanent magnets adhering to the outer circumferential surface of the rotary shaft and the stator coil disposed along the axial direction and the circumferential direction to surround the outsides in the radial directions of the permanent magnets.

Accordingly a thrust force applied to the thrust collar and the thrust bearing can be decreased and as the thrust collar and the thrust bearing a thrust collar and a thrust bearing having low capability and a small size can be adopted and a reduction in size of the shell housing can be realized.

In the hybrid exhaust gas turbocharger an opening end formed on the front surface side of the shell housing of the recess in which the restraint mechanism is accommodated may be closed by a cover and a recess that introduces lubricating oil which is scattered to an inner surface of the cover after being supplied to the thrust bearing into a lubricating oil discharging channel provided on a bottom portion of the front surface side of the shell housing may be provided on the inner surface of the cover.

According to the hybrid exhaust gas turbocharger the lubricating oil lubricating the thrust bearing is more smoothly discharged.

Accordingly the amount of the lubricating oil supplied to the thrust collar and the thrust bearing can be increased and thus the thrust collar and the thrust bearing can be more actively cooled.

Moreover it is possible to simply access the thrust collar and the thrust bearing by simply removing the cover and maintenance properties can be improved.
