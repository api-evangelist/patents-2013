As used herein injection refers to adding to replacing or otherwise modifying the resultant web page content and computer code associated with the requested web page. The injection can be used to insert code to a web page that causes the client to record one or more parameters associated with the time required to render the web page the end user of the client .

With reference to an embodiment of a method of injecting a script into a web page is shown and described. The method includes intercepting step a request for a web page from a requesting entity transmitting step the intercepted request to the web server and intercepting step the response from the web server . The method also includes injecting step a script into the response from the web server and transmitting step the modified response to the requesting entity. In some embodiments the method also includes accelerating step one or more portions of the request for a web page and the response from the web server .

In one embodiment the appliance intercepts step the request from a client to the web server . The appliance can be any of the above reference appliances . For example the appliance in one embodiment is a NetScaler device manufactured by Citrix System Inc of Fort Lauderdale Fla. The communication between the client and the appliance can occur using any of the before mentioned techniques and protocols e.g. TCP IP .

In one embodiment the appliance transmits step the intercepted request to the web server indicated in the request. The intercepted request can be forward to the web server without modification by the appliance or the request can be modified by the appliance . For example the appliance can modify the request and cause a web server other than the web server indicated in the initial request to respond to the request. Again the communication between the appliance and the web server can occur using any of the above mentioned techniques and protocols.

In one the embodiment the appliance intercepts step the response from the web server . The appliance can initiate interception using any of the above mentioned techniques. In some embodiments the appliance servers all or a portion of the requested content to the client .

Once intercepted the appliance inspects the contents of the response and if required injects step a script into the response thereby creating a modified response. In some embodiments various components of the appliance determine whether to inject a script into the response. For example the policy engine determines based on specified criteria whether to modify the response to the web page request by injecting a script into the response. In other embodiments other components of the appliance alone or combination make the determination.

After modification the appliance transmits step the modified response to the client . This communication can occur using any of the before mentioned techniques or protocols.

In some embodiments the appliance accelerates step one or more of the communications between the client appliance and web server . In various embodiments techniques such as 1 transport layer connection pooling 2 transport layer connection multiplexing 3 transport control protocol buffering 4 compression and 5 caching are used alone or in combination to accelerate the communications. Once received by the client an application e.g. a web browser processes the received modified response.

With reference to an embodiment of a method of registering to record a parameter associated with an end user s experience with a web page is shown and described. In one embodiment the method includes receiving step the modified response at the client executing step the script while the web page is rendering and recording step the occurrence of an event indicated in the script. In other embodiments the method also includes recording step information related to the nature of the application rendering the web page.

In one embodiment the client receives step the modified response. The response is received using any of the previously mentioned techniques and protocols. Included in the modified response is at least a portion of a requested web page and the injected script. The script includes in some embodiments instructions that when executed by the client causes the application loading the web page to register for notification of one or more events associated with rendering the web page.

As part of rendering the web page the client executes step the script. In one embodiment an application e.g. browser executes the script. In another embodiment a interpreter such as a Java run time interpreter executes the script. Also the processor of the client can execute the instructions of the script. Further a dedicated application can obtain and process content from a web service.

In one embodiment as the script executes the client registers to receive notification of the occurrence of specific events specified in the script. Upon occurrence of the events the client records step when the event occurred. For example the client can record the time the event occurred relative to the beginning of the rendering of the web page. In other instances other timing mechanisms can be used in recording the occurrence of the event. For example a network clock a master clock or some other clock can be used.

With reference to an embodiment of a header script for monitoring parameters of associated with the experience of the end user of the client is shown and described. With reference to an embodiment of a footer script for use in monitoring parameters of associated with the experience of the end user of the client is shown and described. Together the header and footer cause the browser to register for specific events and report the occurrence of those events to the performance monitoring server of the second domain.

In more detail the scripts of and cooperate to determine the experience of the end user of the client . The script includes instructions to register on a browser which supports the attachEvent method e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer for the onreadystatechange and onbeforeunload events. The browser then fires the first event during the page loading phase and the latter fires just before the page is destroyed. On browsers that follow the World Wide Web Consortium W3C and addEventListener convention the script registers for the DOMContentLoaded load and unload events. The browser fires these in order as the page loads the content on the page completely loads and just before the user leaves the page. The recorded event occurrences are reported in one embodiment to the performance monitoring server as described below in more detail.

Using scripts such as those shown in and provides a mechanism to collect information related to the end user s experience. The scripts are designed to provide an aggregate view of how the user perceived the page load and rendering. It is designed as a light weight mechanism and as such does not record the details of specific items being rendered within the web content. Since the events listed occur when the browser deems page rendering to have progressed to the appropriate point they provide a realistic representation of the end user s view of the page experience.

With reference to an embodiment of a script for use in monitoring parameters of associated with the experience of the end user of the client is shown and described. In this script the browser registers for the occurrence of errors experienced by the end user of the client . Different clients can have different applications e.g. pop up blockers script blockers executing thereon that can affect the experience of the end user. As such a script programmed as part of the web page may not execute properly on the client. It is difficult to program a web page for all possible client configurations. As such injecting a script such as that shown in provides a mechanism for web page providers to determine whether certain aspects of their web pages are being rendered to the client .

In more detail the script of includes instructions to register for error events specific to Microsoft Internet Explorer and W3C compliant browsers and report the occurrence of those events to the performance monitoring server of the second domain. Registration of these events ensures that the script does not collide with any application defined event handlers. The recorded event occurrences are reported in one embodiment to the performance monitoring server as described below in more detail.

Using a script such as that shown in provides advantages such as providing web content providers the ability to determine if the end user is experiencing errors with the content providing a centralized reporting facility for the collection of errors without requiring the content provider to modify their content and providing a mechanism to locate precisely where the error is occurring in the content. Other advantages include but are not limited to providing a mechanism to determine an impacted user set and their browser configuration and providing a mechanism that does not impact the end user nor does it require that the end user install any software or other components. Also the script does not impact efforts that a developer might need to make to resolve the issue.

With reference to a method of communication performance data among a plurality of domains is shown and described. The method includes receiving step from a first domain a web page having an injected script executing step the script at the client on the first domain and recording step the occurrence of events indicated in the script. The method also includes transmitting step a request for web page content stored on a server of a second domain and transmitting step the recorded performance parameters to a server of the second domain.

Various mechanisms and methods for injection a script executing a script and recording the occurrence of specific events are described above and are not repeated here.

In one embodiment the script includes instructions to transmit step a request for content of the modified web page to a server on a second domain. For example the server can be the performance monitoring server . The request can be for a specific item of web content. Examples include but are not limited to images audio files video files or any other type of web content. More specifically the request can include a reference for a phantom picture or item that is supposed to be located at the performance monitoring sever . The item may not actually exist at the performance monitoring server .

In another embodiment the actual requested item conveys the nature of the data. For example a request for first image file is made when performance is slow a request for a second file is made when performance is normal and a request for a third file is made when performance is above normal. In such an embodiment the monitoring server includes knowledge related to handling this type of scenario.

In some embodiments the client transmits step the recorded performance data as part of the request. Said another way during script execution a call is made to the performance monitoring server and the captured performance data is dropped off at the performance monitoring server server when the script attempts to access the item that is called.

In further detail and in another embodiment when the injected script executes the cataloged events are encoded in the query parameters of an URL source for an image dynamically created by the script. The script uses this URL to contact the performance monitoring server and waits a short period of time for the image to be returned. If no image is returned within this period the script aborts the image download. When the performance monitoring server receives the URL request the server returns as data a small cached image and closes the HTTP connection before continuing processing of the request to store the events.

Using the techniques described above certain advantages and features are realized. Examples include but are not limited to reducing the load on the appliance by removing the reporting and performance monitoring processes from the appliance. Also waiting for the URL to return an image aids in ensuring that the collected event data is received by the server even if the user abandons the web page. Also implementing a download abort process helps to ensure that if there are network errors or the script encounters a busy performance monitoring server then the end user does not experience a busy web browser. In addition closing the HTTP connection on the web server prior to continuing processing helps to ensure that end users are not forced to wait for the monitoring web site to save data and allows the web server to accept additional HTTP connections while data is saved.

Using the techniques and features provided above performance of the appliance can be displayed in various reports. For example improvements in web page delivery can be shown using one or scripts. The various acceleration techniques can be turned on and turned off and a comparison of the end user s experience in the rendering of a web page can be compared at each setting.

Using the techniques and features provided above the performance monitoring server can retain an historical view of the ongoing operation of the application thereby allowing its operators to determine appliance effectiveness and capacity.

Using the techniques and features provided above the performance monitoring server can retain an historical view of the ongoing end user experience with the applications contained on server thereby allowing application owners to determine if ongoing application modifications are improving the perceived performance of the applications.
