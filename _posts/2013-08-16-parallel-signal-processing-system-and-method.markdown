title: Parallel signal processing system and method
abstract: A system and method for processing a plurality of channels, for example audio channels, in parallel is provided. For example, a plurality of telephony channels are processed in order to detect and respond to call progress tones. The channels may be processed according to a common transform algorithm. Advantageously, a massively parallel architecture is employed, in which operations on many channels are synchronized, to achieve a high efficiency parallel processing environment. The parallel processor may be situated on a data bus, separate from a main general purpose processor, or integrated with the processor in a common board or integrated device. All, or a portion of a speech processing algorithm may also be performed in a massively parallel manner.

The present application is a Division of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 337 236 filed Dec. 17 2008 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 515 052 issued Aug. 20 2013 which claims benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 014 106 filed Dec. 17 2007 the entirety of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.

The invention relates to the field of real time digital audio processing particularly in a telephony switch context.

Existing telephone systems such as the Calltrol Object Telephony Server OTS tend to require relatively expensive special purpose hardware to process hundreds of voice channels simultaneously. More information about this system can be found at www.calltrol.com newsolutionsforoldchallenges.pdf www.calltrol.com crmconvergence saleslogix.pdf and www.calltrol.com CalltrolSDKWhitepaper6 02.pdf each of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

In many traditional systems a single dedicated analog or digital circuit is provided for each public switch telephone network PSTN line. See e.g. Consumer Microcircuits Limited CMX673 datasheet Clare M 985 01 datasheet. In other types of systems the call progress tone analyzer may be statistically shared between multiple channels imposing certain limitations and detection latencies.

Digital signal processor algorithms are also known for analyzing call progress tones CPT . See e.g. Manish Marwah and Sharmistha Das UNICA A Unified Classification Algorithm For Call Progress Tones Avaya Labs University of Colorado expressly incorporated herein by reference.

Call progress tone signals provide information regarding the status or progress of a call to customers operators and connected equipment. In circuit associated signaling these audible tones are transmitted over the voice path within the frequency limits of the voice band. The four most common call progress tones are Dial tone Busy tone Audible ringback and Reorder tone. In addition to these there are a number of other defined tones including for example the 12 DTMF codes on a normal telephone keypad. There may be for example about 53 different tones supported by a system. A call progress tone detector may additionally respond to cue indicating Cessation of ringback Presence cessation of voice Special Information Tones SITs and Pager cue tones. Collectively call progress tones and these other audible signals are referred to as call progress events. Call progress tone generation detection in the network is generally based on a Precise Tone Plan. In the plan four distinctive tones are used singly or in combination to produce unique progress tone signals. These tones are 350 Hz 440 Hz 480 Hz and 620 Hz. Each call progress tone is defined by the frequencies used and a specific on off temporal pattern.

The ITU T E.180 and E.182 recommendations define the technical characteristics and intended usage of some of these tones busy tone or busy signal call waiting tone comfort tone conference call tone confirmation tone congestion tone dial tone end of three party service tone three way calling executive override tone holding tone howler tone intercept tone intrusion tone line lock out tone negative indication tone notify tone number unobtainable tone pay tone payphone recognition tone permanent signal tone preemption tone queue tone recall dial tone record tone ringback tone or ringing tone ringtone or ringing signal second dial tone special dial tone special information tone SIT waiting tone warning tone Acceptance tone Audible ring tone Busy override warning tone Busy verification tone Engaged tone Facilities tone Fast busy tone Function acknowledge tone Identification tone Intercept tone Permanent signal tone Positive indication tone Re order tone Refusal tone Ringback tone Route tone Service activated tone Special ringing tone Stutter dial tone Switching tone Test number tone Test tone and Trunk offering tone. In addition signals sent to the PSTN include Answer tone Calling tone Guard tone Pulse loop disconnect dialing Tone DTMF dialing and other signals from the PSTN include Billing metering signal DC conditions and Ringing signal. The tones cadence and tone definitions may differ between different countries carriers types of equipment etc. See e.g. Annex to ITU Operational Bulletin No. 781 1.II.2003. Various Tones Used In National Networks According To ITU T Recommendation E.180 March 1998 .

Dial tone indicates that the CO is ready to accept digits from the subscriber. In the precise tone plan dial tone consists of 350 Hz plus 440 Hz. The system reports the presence of precise dial tone after approximately 0.75 seconds of steady tone. Nonprecise dial tone is reported after the system detects a burst of raw energy lasting for approximately 3 seconds.

Busy tone indicates that the called line has been reached but it is engaged in another call. In the precise tone plan busy tone consists of 480 Hz plus 620 Hz interrupted at 60 ipm interruptions per minute with a 0.5 seconds on 0.5 seconds off temporal pattern. The system reports the presence of precise busy tone after approximately two cycles of this pattern. Nonprecise busy tone is reported after three cycles.

Audible ringback ring tone is returned to the calling party to indicate that the called line has been reached and power ringing has started. In the precise tone plan audible ringback consists of 440 Hz plus 480 Hz with a 2 seconds on 4 seconds off temporal pattern. The system reports the presence of precise audible ringback after two cycles of this pattern.

Outdated equipment in some areas may produce nonprecise or dirty ringback. Nonprecise ringback is reported after two cycles of a 1 to 2.5 seconds on 2.5 to 4.5 seconds off pattern of raw energy. The system may report dirty ringback as voice detection unless voice detection is specifically ignored during this period. The system reports ringback cessation after 3 to 6.5 seconds of silence once ringback has been detected depending at what point in the ringback cycle the CPA starts listening .

Reorder Fast Busy tone indicates that the local switching paths to the calling office or equipment serving the customer are busy or that a toll circuit is not available. In the precise tone plan reorder consists of 480 Hz plus 620 Hz interrupted at 120 ipm interruptions per minute with a 0.25 seconds on 0.25 seconds off temporal pattern. The system reports the presence of precise reorder tone after two cycles of this pattern. Nnonprecise reorder tone is reported after three cycles.

Voice detection has multiple uses and can be used to detect voice as an answer condition and also to detect machine generated announcements that may indicate an error condition. Voice presence can be detected after approximately 0.25 to 0.5 seconds of continuous human speech falling within the 200 Hz to 3400 Hz voiceband although the PSTN only guarantees voice performance between 300 Hz to 800 Hz. A voice cessation condition may be determined for example after approximately 0.5 to 1.0 seconds of silence once the presence of voice has been detected.

Special Information Tones SITs indicate network conditions encountered in both the Local Exchange Carrier LEC and Inter Exchange Carrier IXC networks. The tones alert the caller that a machine generated announcement follows this announcement describes the network condition . Each SIT consists of a precise three tone sequence the first tone is either 913.8 Hz or 985.2 Hz the second tone is either 1370.6 Hz or 1428.5 Hz and the third is always 1776.7 Hz. The duration of the first and second tones can be either 274 ms or 380 ms while the duration of the third remains a constant 380 ms. The names descriptions and characteristics of the four most common SITs are summarized in Table 2.

Pager cue tones are used by pager terminal equipment to signal callers or connected equipment to enter the callback number this number is then transmitted to the paged party . Most pager terminal equipment manufacturers use a 3 or 4 tone burst of 1400 Hz at 100 to 125 ms intervals. The system identifies three cycles of 1400 Hz at these approximate intervals as pager cue tones. To accommodate varying terminal equipment signals tone bursts of 1400 Hz in a variety of patterns may also be reported as pager cue tones. Voice prompts sometimes accompany pager cue tones to provide instructions. Therefore combinations of prompts and tones may be detected by configuring an answer supervision template to respond to both voice detection and pager cue tone detection.

A Goertzel filter algorithm may be used to detect the solid tones that begin fax or data modem calls. If any of the following tones are detected a modem fax or data state is indicated 2100 Hz 2225 Hz 1800 Hz 2250 Hz 1300 Hz 1400 Hz 980 Hz 1200 Hz 600 Hz or 3000 Hz. Fax detection relies on the 1.5 seconds of HDLC flags that precede the answering fax terminal s DIS frame. DIS is used by the answering terminal to declare its capabilities. After a solid tone is detected a V.21 receiver is used to detect the HDLC flags 01111110 in the preamble of DIS signal on the downstream side. If the required number of flags are detected fax is reported. Otherwise upon expiration of a timer the call is may be determined to be a data modem communication. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 7 003 093 the entirety of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. See also U.S. Pat. No. 7 043 006 expressly incorporated herein by reference.

Therefore a well developed system exists for in band signaling over audio channels with a modest degree of complexity and some variability between standards which themselves may change over time.

One known digital signal processor architecture exemplified by the nVidia Tesla C870 GPU device provides a massively multi threaded architecture providing over 500 gigaflops peak floating point performance. This device encompasses a 128 processor computing core and is typically provided as a coprocessor on a high speed bus for a standard personal computer platform. Similarly the AMD ATI Firestream 9170 also reports 500 gigaflops performance from a GPU type device with double precision floating point capability. Likewise newly described devices e.g. AMD Fusion integrate a CPU and GPU on a single die with shared external interfaces. See for example www.nvidia.com object tesla product literature.html S1070 1U System Specification Document 2.03 MB PDF NVIDIA Tesla S1070 Datasheet 258 KB PDF NVIDIA Tesla Personal Supercomputer Datasheet 517 KB PDF C1060 Board Specification Document 514 KB PDF NVIDIA Tesla C1060 Datasheet 153 KB PDF NVIDIA Tesla 8 Series Product Overview 1.69 MB PDF C870 Board Specification Document 478 KB PDF D870 System Specification Document 630 KB PDF S870 1U Board Specification Document 13.3 MB PDF NVIDIA Tesla 8 Series GPU Computing Technical Brief 3.73 MB PDF www.nvidia.com object cuda programming tools.html PTX Parallel Thread Execution ISA Version 1.2 developer.download.nvidia.com compute cuda 20 docs NVIDIA CUDA Programming Guide2.0.pdf developer.download.nvidia.com compute cuda 2 docs CudaReferenceManual2.0.pdf developer.download.nvidia.com compute cuda 20 docs CUBLAS Library2.0.pdf developer.download.nvidia.com compute cuda 20 docs CUFFT Library2.0.pdf each of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The nVidia Tesla GPU is supported by the Compute Unified Device Architecture CUDA software development environment which provides C language support. Typical applications proposed for the nVidia Tesla GPU supported by CUDA are Parallel bitonic sort Matrix multiplication Matrix transpose Performance profiling using timers Parallel prefix sum scan of large arrays Image convolution 1D DWT using Haar wavelet OpenGL and Direct3D graphics interoperation examples Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines Fast Fourier Transform Binomial Option Pricing Black Scholes Option Pricing Monte Carlo Option Pricing Parallel Mersenne Twister random number generation Parallel Histogram Image Denoising and a Sobel Edge Detection Filter. Therefore the typical proposed applications are computer software profiling matrix applications image processing applications financial applications Seismic simulations Computational biology Pattern recognition Signal processing and Physical simulation. CUDA technology offers the ability for threads to cooperate when solving a problem. The nVidia Tesla GPUs featuring CUDA technology have an on chip Parallel Data Cache that can store information directly on the GPU allowing computing threads to instantly share information rather than wait for data from much slower off chip DRAMs. Likewise the software compile aspects of CUDA are able to partition code between the GPU and a host processor for example to effect data transfers and to execute on the host processor algorithms and code which are incompatible or unsuitable for efficient execution on the GPU itself.

GPU architectures are generally well suited to address problems that can be expressed as data parallel computations the same program is executed on many data elements in parallel with high arithmetic intensity the ratio of arithmetic operations to memory operations. Because the same program is executed for each data element there is a lower requirement for sophisticated flow control and because it is executed on many data elements and has high arithmetic intensity the memory access latency can be hidden with calculations instead of big data caches. Thus the GPU architecture typically provides a larger number of arithmetic logic units than independently and concurrently operable instruction decoders. Data parallel processing maps data elements to parallel processing threads. Many applications that process large data sets such as arrays can use a data parallel programming model to speed up the computations. In 3D rendering large sets of pixels and vertices are mapped to parallel threads. Similarly image and media processing applications such as post processing of rendered images video encoding and decoding image scaling stereo vision and pattern recognition can map image blocks and pixels to parallel processing threads. In fact many algorithms outside the field of image rendering and processing are accelerated by data parallel processing from general signal processing or physics simulation to computational finance or computational biology.

The Tesla GPU device is implemented as a set of multiprocessors e.g. 8 on the C870 device each of which has a Single Instruction Multiple Data architecture SIMD At any given clock cycle each processor 16 per multiprocessor on the C870 of the multiprocessor executes the same instruction but operates on different data. Each multiprocessor has on chip memory of the four following types One set of local 32 bit registers per processor a parallel data cache or shared memory that is shared by all the processors and implements the shared memory space a read only constant cache that is shared by all the processors and speeds up reads from the constant memory space which is implemented as a read only region of device memory and a read only texture cache that is shared by all the processors and speeds up reads from the texture memory space which is implemented as a read only region of device memory. The local and global memory spaces are implemented as read write regions of device memory and are not cached. Each multiprocessor accesses the texture cache via a texture unit. A grid of thread blocks is executed on the device by executing one or more blocks on each multiprocessor using time slicing Each block is split into SIMD groups of threads called warps each of these warps contains the same number of threads called the warp size and is executed by the multiprocessor in a SIMD fashion a thread scheduler periodically switches from one warp to another to maximize the use of the multiprocessor s computational resources. A half warp is either the first or second half of a warp. The way a block is split into warps is always the same each warp contains threads of consecutive increasing thread IDs with the first warp containing thread 0. A block is processed by only one multiprocessor so that the shared memory space resides in the on chip shared memory leading to very fast memory accesses. The multiprocessor s registers are allocated among the threads of the block. If the number of registers used per thread multiplied by the number of threads in the block is greater than the total number of registers per multiprocessor the block cannot be executed and the corresponding kernel will fail to launch. Several blocks can be processed by the same multiprocessor concurrently by allocating the multiprocessor s registers and shared memory among the blocks. The issue order of the warps within a block is undefined but their execution can be synchronized to coordinate global or shared memory accesses. The issue order of the blocks within a grid of thread blocks is undefined and there is no synchronization mechanism between blocks so threads from two different blocks of the same grid cannot safely communicate with each other through global memory during the execution of the grid.

Telephony control and switching applications have for many years employed general purpose computer operating systems and indeed the UNIX system was originally developed by Bell Laboratories AT T. There are a number of available telephone switch platforms especially private branch exchange implementations which use an industry standard PC Server platform typically with specialized telephony support hardware. These include for example Asterisk from Digium PBX platform PBXtra Fonality Callweaver Sangoma etc. See also e.g. www.voip info.org wiki . Typically these support voice over Internet protocol VOIP communications in addition to switched circuit technologies.

As discussed above typical automated telephone signaling provides in band signaling which therefore employs acoustic signals. A switching system must respond to these signals or it is deemed deficient. Typically an analog or digital call progress tone detector is provided for each channel of a switched circuit system. For VOIP systems this functionality maybe provided in a gateway media gateway either as in traditional switched circuit systems or as a software process within a digital signal processor.

Because of the computational complexity of the call progress tone analysis task the density of digital signal processing systems for simultaneously handling a large number of voice communications has been limited. For example 8 channel call progress tone detection may be supported in a single Texas Instruments TMS320C5510 digital signal processor DSP . See IP PBX Chip from Adaptive Digital Technologies Inc. www.adaptivedigital.com product solution ip pbx.htm . The tone detection algorithms consume for example over 1 MIPS per channel for a full suite of detection functions depending on algorithm processor architecture etc. Scaling to hundreds of channels per system is cumbersome and typically requires special purpose dedicated and often costly hardware which occupy a very limited number of expansion bus slots of a PBX system.

The present system and method improve the cost and efficiency of real time digital signal processing with respect to analog signals and in particular telephony signaling functions.

In one aspect of the invention a massively parallel digital signal processor is employed to perform telephony in band signaling detection and analysis. In another aspect a massively parallel coprocessor card is added to a telephony server which is executed on a standard processor to increase call progress tone detection performance. Advantageously the massively parallel processor is adapted to execute standard software such as C language and therefore may perform both massively parallel tasks and with a likely lower degree of efficiency serial execution tasks as well. Thus a telephony system may be implemented on a single processor system or within a distributed and or processor coprocessor architecture.

Data blocks each including a time slice from a single audio channel are fed in parallel to the massively parallel processor which performs operations in parallel on a plurality of time slices generally executing the same instruction on the plurality of time slices. In this system real time performance may be effectively achieved with a predetermined maximum processing latency. In many cases it is not necessary to detect tones on each audio channel continuously and therefore the system may sample each channel sequentially. In addition if a Fast Fourier Transform type algorithm is employed the real I and imaginary Q channels may each be presented with data from different sources leading to a doubling of capacity. Thus for example using an nVidia Tesla C870 GPU with 128 processors each processor can handle 8 real only or 16 real and imaginary audio channels leading to a density of 1024 or 2048 channel call progress tone detection. Practically the system is not operated at capacity and therefore up to about 800 voice channels may be processed using a general purpose commercially available coprocessor card for a PC architecture.

For example a PC architecture server executes Asterisk PBX software under the Linux operating system. A call is provided from the Asterisk PBX software to a dynamic linked library DLL which transfers data from a buffer in main memory containing time slices for the analog channels to be processed. For example 2 mS each for 800 channels at an 8.4 kHz sampling rate is provided 132 kB in the buffer. The buffer contents is transferred to the coprocessor through a PCIe x16 interface along with a call to perform an FFT for each channel with appropriate windowing and or using continuity from prior samples. The FFT may then be filtered on the coprocessor with the results presented to the host processor or the raw FFT data transferred to the host for filtering. Using a time to frequency domain transform the signal energy at a specified frequency is converted to an amplitude peak at a specific frequency bin which is readily extracted. Temporal analysis may also be performed in either the coprocessor or processor though preferably this is performed in the processor. The analysis and data transform may also be used for speech recognition primitives and for other processes.

A particular advantage of this architecture arises from the suitability of the call progress tone analysis to be performed in parallel since the algorithm is deterministic and has few or no branch points. Thus the task is defined to efficiently exploit the processing power and parallelism of a massively parallel processor.

One embodiment of the present invention provides a system and method for analyzing call progress tones and performing other types of audio band processing on a plurality of voice channels for example in a telephone system. Examples of call progress tone analysis can be found at www.commetrex.com products algorithms CPA.html www.dialogic.com network csp appnots 10117 CPA SR6 HMP2.pdf whitepapers.zdnet.co.uk 0 1000000651 260123088p 00.htm and www.pikatechnologies.com downloads samples readme 6.2 20 20Call 20Progress 20Analysis 20 20ReadMe.txt each of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.

In a modest size system for analyzing call progress tones there may be hundreds of voice channels to be handled are simultaneously. Indeed the availability of a general purpose call progress tone processing system permits systems to define non standard or additional signaling capabilities thus reducing the need for out of band signaling. Voice processing systems generally require real time performance that is connections must be maintained and packets or streams forwarded within narrow time windows and call progress tones processed within tight specifications.

An emerging class of telephone communication processing system implements a private branch exchange PBX switch which employs a standard personal computer PC as a system processor and employs software which executes on a general purpose operating system OS . For example the Asterisk system runs on the Linux OS. More information about Asterisk may be found at Digium Asterisk 445 Jan Davis Drive NW Huntsville Ala. 35806 256.428.6000 asterisk.org downloads. Another such system is Yate Yet Another Telephony Engine available from Bd. Nicolae Titulescu 10 Bl. 20 Sc. C Ap. 128 Sector 1 Bucharest Romania yate.null.ro pmwiki index.php n Main.Download.

In such systems scalability to desired levels for example hundreds of simultaneous voice channels requires that the host processor have sufficient headroom to perform all required tasks within the time allotted. Alternately stated the tasks performed by the host processor should be limited to those it is capable of completing without contention or undue delay. Because digitized audio signal processing is resource intensive PC based systems have typically not implemented functionality which requires per channel signal processing or offloaded the processing to specialized digital signal processing DSP boards. Further such DSP boards are themselves limited for example 8 16 voice processed channels per DSP core with 4 32 cores per board although higher density boards are available. These boards are relatively expensive as compared to the general purpose PC and occupy a limited number of bus expansion slots.

The present invention provides an alternate to the use of specialized DSP processors dedicated to voice channel processing. According to one embodiment a massively parallel processor as available in a modern video graphics processor though not necessarily configured as such is employed to perform certain audio channel processing tasks providing substantial capacity and versatility. One example of such a video graphics processor is the nVidia Tesla GPU using the CUDA software development platform GPU . This system provides 8 banks of 16 processors 128 processors total each processor capable of handling a real time fast Fourier transform FFT on 8 16 channels. For example the FFT algorithm facilitates subsequent processing to detect call progress tones which may be detected in the massively parallel processor environment or using the host processor after downloading the FFT data. One particularly advantageous characteristic of implementation of a general purpose FFT algorithm rather than specific call tone detection algorithms is that a number of different call tone standards and extensions variants thereof may be supported and the FFT data may be used for a number of different purposes for example speech recognition etc.

Likewise the signal processing is not limited to FFT algorithms and therefore other algorithms may also or alternately be performed. For example wavelet based algorithms may provide useful information.

The architecture of the system provides a dynamic link library DLL available for calls from the telephony control software e.g. Asterisk. An application programming interface API provides communication between the telephony control software TCS and the DLL. This TCS is either unmodified or minimally modified to support the enhanced functionality which is separately compartmentalized.

The TCS for example executes a process which calls the DLL causing the DLL to transfer a data from a buffer holding e.g. 2 mS of voice data for e.g. 800 voice channels from main system memory of the PC to the massively parallel coprocessor MPC which is for example an nVidia Tesla platform. The DLL has previously uploaded to the MPC the algorithm which is for example a parallel FFT algorithm which operates on all 800 channels simultaneously. It may for example also perform tone detection and produce an output in the MPC memory of the FFT representation of the 800 voice channels and possibly certain processed information and flags. The DLL then transfers the information from the MPC memory to PC main memory for access by the TCS or other processes after completion.

While the MPC has massive computational power it has somewhat limited controllability. For example a bank of 16 DSPs in the MPC are controlled by a single instruction pointer meaning that the algorithms executing within the MPC are generally not data dependent in execution nor have conditional contingent branching since this would require each thread to execute different instructions and thus dramatically reduce throughput. Therefore the algorithms are preferably designed to avoid such processes and should generally be deterministic and non data dependent algorithms. On the other hand it is possible to perform contingent or data dependent processing though the gains from the massively parallel architecture are limited and thus channel specific processing is possible. Advantageously implementations of the FFT algorithm are employed which meet the requirements for massively parallel execution. For example the CUDA technology environment from nVidia provides such algorithms Likewise post processing of the FFT data to determine the presence of tones poses a limited burden on the processor s and need not be performed under massively parallel conditions. This tone extraction process may therefore be performed on the MPC or the host PC processor depending on respective processing loads and headroom.

In general the FFT itself should be performed in faster than real time manner. For example it may be desired to implement overlapping FFTs e.g. examining 2 mS of data every 1 mS including memory to memory transfers and associated processing. Thus for example it may be desired to complete the FFT of 2 mS of data on the MPC within 0.5 mS. Assuming for example a sampling rate of 8.4 kHz and an upper frequency within a channel of 3.2 4 kHz the 2 mS sample would generally imply a 256 point FFT which can be performed efficiently and quickly on the nVidia Tesla platform including any required windowing and post processing.

Therefore the use of the present invention permits the addition of call progress tone processing and other per channel signal processing tasks to a PC based TCS platform without substantially increasing the processing burden on the host PC processor and generally permits such a platform to add generic call progress tone processing features and other per channel signal processing features without substantially limiting scalability.

Other sorts of parallel real time processing are also possible for example analysis of distributed sensor signals such as Motes or the like. See en.wikipedia.org wiki Smartdust. The MPC may also be employed to perform other telephony tasks such as echo cancellation conferencing tone generation compression decompression caller ID interactive voice response voicemail packet processing and packet loss recovery algorithms etc.

Similarly simultaneous voice recognition can be performed on hundreds of simultaneous channels for instance in the context of directing incoming calls based on customer responses at a customer service center. Advantageously in such an environment processing of particular channels maybe switched between banks of multiprocessors depending on the processing task required for the channel and the instructions being executed by the multiprocessor. Thus to the extent that the processing of a channel is data dependent but the algorithm has a limited number of different paths based on the data the MPC system may efficiently process the channels even where the processing sequence and instructions for each channel is not identical.

Massively multiplexed voice data is received at network interface . The network could be a LAN Wide Area Network WAN Prime Rate ISDN PRI a traditional telephone network with Time Division Multiplexing TDM or any other suitable network. This data may typically include hundreds of channels each carrying a separate conversation and also routing information. The routing information may be in the form of in band signaling of dual frequency DTMF audio tones received from a telephone keypad or DTMF generator. The channels may be encoded using digital sampling of the audio input prior to multiplexing. Typically voice channels will come in 20 ms frames.

The system according to a preferred coprocessor embodiment includes at least one host processor which may be programmed with telephony software such as Asterisk or Yate cited above. The host processor may be of any suitable type such as those found in PCs for example Intel Pentium Core 2 Duo or Quadra or AMD Athlon X2. The host processor communicates via shared memory with MPC which is for example 2 GB or more of DDR2 or DDR3 memory.

Within the host processor application programs receive demultiplexed voice data from interface and generate service requests for services that cannot or are desired not to be be processed in real time within the host processor itself. These service requests are stored in a service request queue . A service calling module organizes the service requests from the queue for presentation to the MPC .

The module also reports results back to the user applications which in turn put processed voice data frames back on the channels in real time such that the next set of frames coming in on the channels can be processed as they arrive.

In the case of call progress tones these three operations together FFT mixing and decoding will determine the destination of a call associated with the block of audio data for the purposes of telephone switching.

If module sends more request for a particular service than can be accommodated at once some of the requests will be accumulated in a shared RAM to be completed in a later processing cycle. The MPC will be able to perform multiple instances of the requested service within the time constraints imposed by the loop of . Various tasks may be assigned priorities or deadlines and therefore the processing of different services may be selected for processing based on these criteria and need not be processed in strict order.

It is noted that the present invention is not limited to nVidia Tesla parallel processing technology and may make use of various other technologies. For example the Intel Larrabee GPU technology which parallelizes a number of P54C processors may also be employed as well as ATI CTM technology ati.amd.com technology streamcomputing index.html ati.amd.com technology streamcomputing resources.html each of which including linked resources is expressly incorporated herein by reference and other known technologies.

The following is some pseudo code illustrating embodiments of the invention as implemented in software. The disclosure of a software embodiment does not preclude the possibility that the invention might be implemented in hardware.

The present example provides computer executable code which is stored in a computer readable medium for execution on a programmable processor to implement an embodiment of the invention. The computer is for example an Intel dual core processor based machine with one or more nVidia Tesla compatible cards in PCIe x16 slots for example nVidia C870 or C1060 processor. The system typically stores executable code on a SATA 300 interface rotating magnetic storage media i.e. a so called hard disk drive though other memory media such as optical media solid state storage or other known computer readable media may be employed. Indeed the instructions may be provided to the processors as electromagnetic signals communicated through a vacuum or conductive or dielectric medium. The nVidia processor typically relies on DDR3 memory while the main processor typically relies on DDR2 memory though the type of random access memory is non critical. The telephony signals for processing may be received over a T1 T3 optical fiber Ethernet or other communications medium and or protocol.

While the embodiment discussed above uses a separate host and massively parallel processing array it is clear that the processing array may also execute general purpose code and support general purpose or application specific operating systems albeit with reduced efficiency as compared to an unbranched signal processing algorithm. Therefore it is possible to employ a single processor core and memory pool thus reducing system cost and simplifying system architecture. Indeed one or more multiprocessors may be dedicated to signal processing and other s to system control coordination and logical analysis and execution. In such a case the functions identified above as being performed in the host processor would be performed in the array and of course the transfers across the bus separating the two would not be required.
