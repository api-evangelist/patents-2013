The disclosure relates to data distribution. More particularly the methods and systems described herein relate to identification of opportunities to increase a level of distribution of data.

Conventional methods for identifying opportunities to increase a level of distribution of data typically focus on analyzing an attribute of the data itself. However such typical methods may be limited in the ability to identify additional opportunities for increasing a level of distribution of the data since such conventional systems do not typically provide functionality for analyzing other potentially relevant types of data.

In one aspect a computer implemented method includes receiving by a first computing device an identification of a video and an identification of a distribution channel of the video. The method includes retrieving by the first computing device from a video sharing network metadata associated with a video. The method includes retrieving by the first computing device from a second computing device in a second network data having at least one characteristic in common with the metadata. The method includes generating by the first computing device a profile of the video based on the retrieved data and the metadata. The method includes generating by the first computing device a profile of the distribution channel based on the retrieved data and metadata. The method includes generating by the first computing device a recommendation for a method to increase a level of distribution of the video. The method includes providing by the first computing device to a user the recommendation.

In another aspect a system for identifying distribution opportunities includes a data aggregator a profile generator and a recommendation engine. The data aggregator executes on a first computing device and receives an identification of a video and an identification of a distribution channel of the video. The data aggregator retrieves from a video sharing network metadata associated with a video and retrieves from a second computing device in a second network data having at least one characteristic in common with the metadata. The profile generator executes on the first computing device generates a profile of the video based on the retrieved data and the metadata and generates a profile of the distribution channel based on the retrieved data and metadata. The recommendation engine executes on the first computing device generates a recommendation for a method to increase a level of distribution of the video and provides to a user the recommendation.

Although depicted in as a distributed system in which the user accesses the client to connect to the machine in alternative embodiments and as shown in the user accesses the machine directly.

Referring now to a flow diagram depicts one embodiment of a method for identifying distribution opportunities. In brief overview the method includes receiving by a first computing device an identification of a video and an identification of a distribution channel of the video . The method includes retrieving by the first computing device from a video sharing network metadata associated with the video . The method includes retrieving by the first computing device from a second computing device in a second network data having at least one characteristic in common with the metadata . The method includes generating by the first computing device a profile of the video based on the retrieved data and the metadata . The method includes generating by the first computing device a profile of the distribution channel based on the retrieved data and metadata . The method includes generating by the first computing device a recommendation for a method to increase a level of distribution of the video . The method includes providing by the first computing device to a user the recommendation .

Referring now to in greater detail and in connection with the first computing device receives an identification of a video and an identification of a distribution channel of the video . In one embodiment the machine receives a copy of the video. In another embodiment the machine receives an identification of a computing device hosting the video such as a uniform resource locator URL . In still another embodiment the identification of the distribution channel is a URL. In yet another embodiment the distribution channel is a channel on the video sharing network for example a themed channel where users upload videos having substantially similar content. In some embodiments channels are defined by video metadata such as without limitation content themes topics keywords users actors producers the form of technical delivery and popularity.

In one embodiment instead of receiving an identification of a video and an identification of a distribution channel of the video the machine receives metadata for use in identifying distribution opportunities. In such an embodiment instead of using the identification of the video and the identification of the distribution channel of the video for retrieving metadata and performing the functionality described below the machine uses the received metadata to retrieve additional metadata and perform the functionality described below.

The first computing device retrieves from a video sharing network metadata associated with the video . In some embodiments the data aggregator retrieves the metadata. In one embodiment the machine analyzes the identified video to identify the metadata to retrieve. For example in an embodiment in which the machine retrieves a copy of the video a video analysis component not shown analyzes the video file to identify metadata such as without limitation keywords provided with the video. In another embodiment the machine receives the metadata from a user instead of or in addition to the identification of the video and the identification of the distribution channel. However in other embodiments the machine does not receive the metadata from the user and instead transmits requests to other computing devices for the metadata. For example the machine may use an API to retrieve the metadata from the video sharing network computing device for instance using an API to retrieve comments viewers of the video wrote and uploaded to the distribution channel and analyzing the comments to identify keywords sentiment popularity and other metadata.

In some embodiments the retrieved metadata includes data about a distribution channel that displayed the video. In one of these embodiments the retrieved metadata identifies a source from which traffic to the distribution channel originated. For example the retrieved metadata may indicate whether traffic to the distribution channel originated from advertising displayed on another distribution channel. As another example the retrieved metadata may indicate whether traffic to the distribution channel originated from a viewer clicking on a URL included in a mention of the video shared on a social network. As a further example the retrieved metadata may identify a type of device from which a viewer of the video accessed the distribution channel e.g. from a mobile computing device from a desktop computing device or from a tablet computing device . In one embodiment the machine analyzes the retrieved metadata and identifies based on the analysis a source from which traffic to the distribution channel originated the machine may then correlate the identified source with a characteristic of the distribution channel based upon the identified source and include an identification of the characteristic in the distribution channel profile . In such an embodiment the channel related metadata may provide additional information about the nature of a channel and its relevance to the video. For example demographic data may be inferred from the channel related metadata and used in providing a recommendation related to the video. As another example the machine may correlate one or more relevant characteristics such as the popularity of a channel on a social media channel with one or more types of traffic sources. The machine may determine how to perform the correlation based on one or more requirements specified by a user of the system. For instance a first advertiser might want to target young viewers between 13 and 25 and prefer video channels that have a large footprint on social media while a second advertiser might want to target men 35 55 who actively search for information about a certain type of product the machine may determine which characteristics are relevant and how to correlate relevant characteristics with a traffic source based on the requirements of the specific advertiser for which the machine makes a recommendation.

Referring now to a screen shot depicts one embodiment of a plurality of aggregated metrics associated with a particular topic. In one embodiment the machine aggregates metrics for a plurality of channels and a plurality of videos identified by metadata. The aggregated metrics such as traffic sources and demographic segments provide additional information that the machine may access in identifying additional distribution opportunities for the video.

Referring again to the method includes retrieving by the first computing device from a second computing device in a second network data having at least one characteristic in common with the metadata . In some embodiments the data aggregator retrieves the data. In one embodiment the machine retrieves from a search engine computing device search data associated with the metadata. For example the machine may execute a search e.g. by executing a script or using an API on the search engine for metadata e.g. for a keyword associated with a video and determine how the search engine ranked the metadata determine how many other people searched for the same metadata or determine how popular the metadata is. In some embodiments the data aggregator retrieves and aggregates search data associated with the distribution channel. In other embodiments the data aggregator generates a list of videos and distribution channels that have at least one characteristic in common with the metadata based at least in part on the retrieved data.

In another embodiment the first computing device retrieves from a social network computing device social network data associated with the metadata. For example the machine may retrieve from a social network computing device data indicating that a user of the social network shared the video on the social network and commented on it e.g. indicated that he liked the video didn t like the video or had a comment about the video . In some embodiments the data aggregator retrieves the data. In other embodiments the data aggregator retrieves and aggregates social network data associated with the distribution channel. In one of these embodiments the data aggregator retrieves and aggregates data associated with both the metadata for the video and metadata for the distribution channel In other embodiments the data aggregator retrieves and aggregates social network data associated with the video.

In some embodiments the data aggregator performs an initial analysis of data retrieved from the second computing device in the second network the data having at least one characteristic in common with the metadata. In one of these embodiments by way of example the data aggregator performs an analysis to determine whether to retrieve additional data. For example the data aggregator may have retrieved data having at least one characteristic in common with the metadata such as a similar keyword embedded in a comment or a synonym of the metadata used as a keyword and analyze the retrieved data to determine whether to retrieve additional data such as continuing with the example above data associated with the synonym of the metadata . Based upon the initial analysis the data aggregator may determine to retrieve additional data for instance retrieving an identification of a second video associated with a keyword that is a synonym for the metadata. In some embodiments and as will be discussed in additional detail below the profile generator and the recommendation engine may also perform additional analyses of the data.

The first computing device generates a profile of the video based on the retrieved data and the metadata . In one embodiment the profile generator executing on the machine generates the profile. In another embodiment the profile generator retrieves data and metadata from the data aggregator . In still another embodiment the profile generator retrieves data and metadata from a database storing the data and metadata.

Referring to a screen shot depicts one embodiment of a video profile . In the embodiment depicted by the video profile includes a title an image selected from the video a length of the video a number of individuals who have viewed the video and a number of times viewers shared the video on one or more social networks.

Referring again to and in one embodiment the profile generator generates a profile summarizing a level of popularity of the video. In another embodiment the profile generator generates a profile summarizing typical sentiments associated with the video based for example upon how many users said they liked the video in a comment either in the distribution channel or in a second network . In still another embodiment the profile generator generates a user friendly profile that may be provided to a user e.g. the user that provided the identification of the video . In yet another embodiment the profile generator generates a profile that may be used by a software application for additional analysis such as by way of example the recommendation engine . In a further embodiment the profile generator generates a profile including without limitation a title at least one tag a description a length of the video a publication date a number of views the video received popularity metrics e.g. number of social sharing operations number of comments number of likes and a number of dislikes demographic data e.g. the age groups that watched the video the most sources of traffic to the video identification of the channel in which the video published and an identification of an author. In some embodiments the profile generator stores the profile e.g. in a database accessible to the first computing device .

The first computing device generates a profile of the distribution channel based on the retrieved data and metadata . In one embodiment the profile generator executing on the machine generates the profile. In another embodiment the profile generator retrieves data and metadata from the data aggregator . In still another embodiment the profile generator retrieves data and metadata from a database storing the data and metadata.

Referring now to a screen shot depicts one embodiment of a distribution channel profile . In the embodiment depicted in the distribution channel profile includes a number of videos distributed in the channel a number of views of any of the content distributed in the distribution channel a number of distribution channel subscribers a number of videos distributed in the distribution channel that have at least one characteristic in common with the metadata a number of views of the relevant videos a number of social sharing operations on the relevant videos e.g. a number of likes dislikes representing a sentiment level and a number of comments demographic data e.g. the age groups that visited the distribution channel the most sources of traffic to the distribution channel a uniform resource locator URL for the distribution channel and any URLs referenced by the distribution channel such as a URL for a publisher of content to the channel .

In some embodiments the distribution channel profile includes a description of at least one characteristic of the distribution channel that the profile generator identified based upon an analysis of the retrieved data and metadata. In one of these embodiments for example the distribution channel profile identifies a level of loyalty between a viewer of videos and the distribution channel based on a number of views by subscribers of distributed videos the level of loyalty may be used in additional characteristics of the distribution channel such as whether the distribution channel appeals to a particular demographic is associated with a particular product or service brand or is irrelevant all of which may inform a decision to recommend one distribution opportunity over another. As another example the distribution channel profile identifies a level of importance of social sharing to viewers of videos on the distribution channel based on a number of social sharing operations. As another example the distribution channel profile identifies a level of engagement of viewers of videos on the distribution channel based on the number of social sharing operations. The retrieved data and metadata include as described above e.g. in connection with popularity metrics social sharing operations number of views number of subscribers the statistical distribution of the lengths of videos in the distribution channel demographic data sources of traffic to the distribution channel and other metrics from which additional channel characteristics may be derived.

Referring now to a screen shot depicts one embodiment of a display of a plurality of traffic sources used by a particular distribution channel. As depicted in distribution channel profile may include a description of retrieved data and metadata such as the traffic sources shown in .

Referring now to a screen shot depicts an embodiment displaying a visualization of a plurality of distribution channels sorted by user specified criteria. As shown in and by way of example without limitation the system generates a visualization of the top 50 distribution channels sorted by total views for a particular topic. In some embodiments a size of the squares in the visualization indicates a number of views of the video. In other embodiments a shading pattern or color of the squares in the visualization indicates the sentiment of at least one viewer of the distribution channel with respect to the distribution channel s content ranging from mostly negative to mostly positive.

Referring now to a screen shot depicts one embodiment of a display of video view distribution by length. As shown in the machine may generate analyses of various attributes of videos in distribution channels and use the results of those analyses in generating recommendations for additional distribution opportunities. In the example shown in analysis of the distribution of video lengths for a particular group of channels may be relevant to generation of recommendations because particular users e.g. advertisers may choose to use channels that provide more in depth e.g. longer content over those that have only superficial content.

Referring again to and in one embodiment the profile generator generates an enumeration of keywords used by at least one other video on the distribution channel which may be for example a second video having at least one characteristic in common with the metadata. In another embodiment the profile generator analyzes the metadata and builds a list of n gram multi word expressions that describe the metadata of the distribution channel. In still another embodiment the profile generator builds the list of n gram multi word expressions based on without limitation titles tags descriptive texts and user comments. In yet another embodiment the profile generator applies a weight to an entry in the list of n gram multi word expressions calculated by factors including a frequency of the expression a number of different videos that use the expression and a position of the expression in the metadata.

The first computing device generates a recommendation for a method to increase a level of distribution of the video . In some embodiments the recommendation engine generates the recommendation. In one embodiment the recommendation engine generates the recommendation based at least in part upon an analysis of the profile of the video. In another embodiment the recommendation engine generates the recommendation based at least in part upon an analysis of the profile of the distribution channel.

In one embodiment the recommendation engine analyzes the profile of the video. In another embodiment the recommendation engine analyzes the profile of the distribution channel. In still another embodiment a sub component of the recommendation engine performs the analyses e.g. the profile analyzer depicted in shadow in . In some embodiments the recommendation engine analyzes newly generated profiles and previously aggregated data for example the recommendation engine analyzes data that the data aggregator aggregated based on the metadata identified in connection with a request to identify distribution opportunities for a first video. By comparing newly generated profiles with previously aggregated data the recommendation engine can determine which channels show a particularly high degree of activity in the recent past such as a strong growth in the number of views the number of new subscribers or of other metrics that might be relevant to determining a recommendation for a particular video. However in other embodiments the recommendation engine analyzes previously generated profiles and previously aggregated data for example the recommendation engine may determine that data aggregated based on metadata identified in connection with a first video is relevant to an analysis and identification of distribution opportunities for a second video and may analyze previously aggregated data.

In one embodiment the recommendation engine identifies at least one channel adjacent to the distribution channel based at least in part on an analysis of at least one of the profile of the video and the profile of the distribution channel. In some embodiments the recommendation engine analyzes each piece of data aggregated by the data aggregator in order to identify the at least one adjacent channel iterating through the data. In one of these embodiments the data aggregator has already performed an initial analysis of the aggregated data and the recommendation engine performs a second analysis. In another embodiment the recommendation engine identifies the at least one adjacent channel by executing a search of a second computing device e.g. the video sharing network computing device the social network computing device or the search engine computing device for channels associated with a characteristic identified in the profile of the video or associated with a characteristic identified in the profile of the distribution channel. In still another embodiment a sub component of the recommendation engine identifies the at least one adjacent channel e.g. the channel identifier depicted in shadow in .

In some embodiments the recommendation engine identifies the at least one adjacent channel by analyzing a level of relatedness between the at least one adjacent channel and the distribution channel. In one of these embodiments the recommendation engine determines that a high degree of overlap exists between metadata associated with the two channels e.g. the keywords tags demographic profile or other metadata associated with the two channels . In another of these embodiments the recommendation engine determines that the at least one adjacent channel is related to the distribution channel based upon an explicitly defined relation such as a subscription relationship between an owner of the distribution channel and the adjacent channel or vice versa.

In some embodiments the recommendation engine identifies the at least one adjacent channel indirectly. In one of these embodiments the recommendation engine identifies a second video based on the analyses of the profile of the video and of the profile of the distribution channel. In another of these embodiments the recommendation engine identifies a second distribution channel associated with the second video.

In one embodiment the recommendation engine determines that the at least one channel adjacent to the distribution channel has at least one characteristic in common with the distribution channel. For example the adjacent channel may have a common topic theme classification or other characteristic in common with the distribution channel. In another embodiment the recommendation engine transmits an identification of the adjacent channel to the profile generator which generates a profile of the adjacent channel the recommendation engine analyzes the generated profile of the adjacent channel to determine whether the adjacent channel has at least one characteristic in common with the distribution channel. In some embodiments a sub component of the recommendation engine performs the analysis of the adjacent channel to determine whether the adjacent channel has at least one characteristic in common with the distribution channel e.g. the channel analyzer depicted in shadow in . In other embodiments to determine that the at least one adjacent channel has at least one characteristic in common with the distribution channel the recommendation engine retrieves a score for the at least one adjacent channel. In one of these embodiments the recommendation engine analyzes a score based on a plurality of weighted factors. Factors may include by way of example and without limitation a number of views the channel has a number of subscribers a level of user sentiment for the channel a level of social media popularity of the channel e.g. a number of sharing operations the demographic profile of the channel the sources of traffic to the channel the distribution of length of the videos on the channel and a degree of overlap between the original distribution channel and the at least one adjacent channel based on a weighted list of n gram multi word expressions.

In one embodiment the recommendation engine determines that distributing the video on the adjacent channel could enhance a level of distribution of the video. In another embodiment the recommendation engine makes the determination based upon without limitation an analysis of the score for the adjacent channel as described above. In still another embodiment and by way of example the recommendation engine may determine that the distribution channel and the adjacent channel are two separate channels but attract similar users have similar themes distribute videos or other data of similar content or have another characteristic in common that would improve a level of distribution of the video. In another embodiment the recommendation engine determines that distributing the video on the adjacent channel would increase a number of viewers of the video. In still another embodiment the recommendation engine calculates a predicted increase in the number of viewers of the video based on previous viewer numbers of the adjacent channel and viewer numbers of comparable videos. In still another embodiment the recommendation engine determines that distributing the video on the adjacent channel would increase an amount of traffic to a web site associated with the video. In yet another embodiment a sub component of the recommendation engine makes the determination and generates the recommendation based upon the determination e.g. the recommendation generator depicted in shadow in .

In one embodiment the recommendation engine may determine that placing an advertisement on the adjacent channel could enhance a level of distribution of the video. In another embodiment the recommendation engine may determine that promotion on a freely accessible social channel could enhance a level of distribution of the video. In still another embodiment the recommendation engine may determine that other forms of activity such as without limitation social interaction e.g. commenting and commercial distribution deals could enhance a level of distribution of the video. In yet another embodiment the recommendation engine may identify an indirect form of activity that could enhance a level of distribution of the video such as without limitation video search engine optimization SEO in which revising keyword strategies to match strategies of the adjacent channel may enhance the level of distribution. In some embodiments the recommendation engine generates content and marketing ideas from the recommendation going beyond simply identifying distribution opportunities. In one of these embodiments by way of example the recommendation engine may determine based at least in part on data identified by the system that people interested in a particular product seem to like a particular type of content e.g. without limitation tutorial videos and may determine to recommend the production of similar types of content. In yet another embodiment the recommendation engine may determine based at least in part on data identified by the system that people interested in a particular topic prefer videos of a certain length e.g. without limitation shorter clips of one minute or less or longer educational content of 10 minutes of more and may recommend the production of videos of a similar length. In yet another embodiment the recommendation engine may determine based at least in part on data identified by the system that people in a certain demographic group are interested in particular types of content. In some embodiments the recommendation engine may combine several of the identified factors such as topics people are interested in the demographic group they belong to or products they are interested in to determine what type of content these people prefer or that these people prefer videos of a certain length.
