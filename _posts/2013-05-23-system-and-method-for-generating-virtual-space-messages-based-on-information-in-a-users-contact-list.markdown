This disclosure relates to providing virtual space communications by leveraging contact lists associated with users of the virtual space.

Virtual space systems that generate requests for users to establish virtual space connections with other users via email messages are known. For generating such requests those systems typically obtain email addresses of contacts in a user s address book. Using the obtained email addresses of the contacts those systems will generate and communicate on behalf of the user email messages to invite those contacts to join the virtual space. Some of those systems will also generate and communicate on behalf of the user email messages requesting those contacts to join a group of the user in the virtual space e.g. my professional network .

One aspect of the disclosure relates to dynamically generating virtual space messages on behalf of a first user to a second user in the virtual space based on contact information indicating contacts between the two users. The virtual space messages may be so generated to facilitate social interaction mentorship friendship and or any other relationships between the two users within the virtual space. For such facilitations the contact information between the two users may be obtained from a contact list associated with the first user such as e.g. an address book stored on a device associated with the first user a contact register stored in a third party service account of the first user a contact file stored on a client computing platform associated with the first user and or any other source that provide one or more of a contact list associated with the first user. In some examples the obtained contact information may be analyzed and a real world relationship between the two users may be determined. The determined real world relationship between the two users may indicate that they are friends co workers classmates relatives and or any other real world relationships between the two users. Virtual space messages such as but not limited to requesting social interactions e.g. virtual space group activities collaboration competition and or any other social interactions facilitated by the virtual space recommending virtual space activities and or objects and or any other virtual space messages may be generated and communicated to the second user on behalf of the first user. This may improve user experience in the virtual space by dynamically generating communications to facilitate virtual space interactions between virtual space users having real world relationships. This may improve virtual space user retention rate for the provider of the virtual space.

In some implementations a system configured to dynamically generate virtual space message on behalf of a user in the virtual space may include a system server. The system server may be configured to execute one or more of a user module a contact list module a contact entry module a user presence module a message module and or other modules.

The user module may be configured to obtain user information of individual users in the virtual space. The obtained virtual space user information may include information stored by a virtual space server one or more of client computing platforms external resources e.g. web service providers and or other storage locations. The obtained virtual space user information may include for example information identifying users e.g. a username or handle a number an identifier and or other identifying information within the virtual space a phone number email address associated with a user and or other information related to the virtual space users. To obtain such user information the user module may be configured to interface with the virtual space server client computing platforms external resources and or any other storage locations through any suitable wired and or wireless communication channels. The interfaces may include for example but not limited to application programming interface API CGI or WSGI and or any other communication methods facilitated by the virtual space server client computing platforms external resources and or any other storage locations for retrieving the virtual space user information.

The contact list module may be configured to obtain contact lists associated with the users of the virtual space. The obtained contact lists may include but not limited to user contact lists stored by the virtual space server address books and or contact files stored on the client computing platforms associated with the users contact information stored by software implemented on client computing platform contact registers stored by internet service providers contact information provided by telecommunication service providers contact lists stored by email service providers and or any other contact lists. The obtained contact lists may comprise one or more contact entries providing information about contacts in relation to the owners of the contact lists. The information about a contact as provided by a contact entry may indicate but not limited to a name of the contact one or more telephone numbers associated with the contact one or more email addresses associated with the contact one or more real world addresses associated with the contact a relationship between the contact and the owner of the contact list a group status of the contact as classified by the owner of the contact list records of communications between the contact and owner of the contact list content of the individual communications between the contact and the owner of the contact list and or any other information about the contact. The contact list module may be configured to obtain such contact lists from the virtual space server client computing platforms and or any other external resources.

The contact entry module may be configured to obtain contact entries from the contact lists obtained by the contact entry module and correlate the contact entries with users in the virtual space. For obtaining individual contact entries included in a contact list obtained by the contact list module the contact entry module may be configured with semantics such as but not limited to information indicating delimiters that separate individual contact entries in a contact list and or any other semantics to parse the contact list. For correlating individual entries in a contact list with corresponding virtual space users the contact entry module may be configured to extract identifying information such as but not limited to the name the telephone number email address es real world address es and or any other identifying information of a contact from a contact entry. The contact entry module may be configured to compare the extracted identifying information of a contact entry with user information obtained by the user module. A correlation may be made by the contact entry module in cases where the extracted identifying information of a contact entry corresponds to the user information of a user in a virtual space.

In some examples the contact entry module may be configured to determine a relationship between users of the virtual space based on the contact entries. This may involve parsing the contact entry for information indicating a relationship between the contact and owner of the contact list. In some examples the contact entry module may be configured to determine that a virtual space user was introduced to join the virtual space by another user based on the communications between the two users as indicated by contact information extracted from one or more contact lists associated with the two users. For such determinations the contact entry module may be configured with semantics such as but not limited to keywords promotion code patterns and or any other any other semantics for determining such a virtual space induction relationship between the users of the virtual space.

The user presence module may be configured to determine users being present in the virtual space executed and implemented by the virtual space server. For such determinations in some examples the user presence module may send queries to the virtual space server at a sampling rate predetermined by the developer provider administrator and or any other entities related to the system server. Simultaneously and or alternatively the user presence module may be configured to query the virtual space server dynamically for example in response to contacts being correlated with virtual space by the contact entry module. The user presence module may receive responses from the virtual space server for determinations whether individual users are present in the virtual space.

The message module may be configured to generate virtual space messages for communicating with virtual space users based on the contact information indicated by the contact entries. The generated virtual space messages may facilitate social interaction mentorship friendship and or any other relationships between users within the virtual space. The messages may facilitate social interactions between a user and his her contacts both being users of the virtual space. For instance the generated message may invite on behalf of the user his her contacts to join a quest mission or campaign in the virtual space with the user. The messages may facilitate mentorship between the user and his her contacts. For instance the generated message may recommend the contacts to join an alliance the user belongs to to build certain infrastructure and or any other virtual space information that may help further the contacts progression in the virtual space. In some examples the messages may simply facilitate friendship between the user and his her contacts by for example welcoming the contacts to the virtual space.

In some implementations the message module may be configured to determine a communication means through which a message generated on behalf of a user by the message module may be communicated to his her contact based on the contact information obtained from the contact list associated with the user. In some implementations user interfaces may be provided to facilitate the user to specify preferred ways to communicate with his her contacts frequencies at which to communicate with the contacts type of messages for the communication and or any other parameters for the message module. In those implementations the message module may generate and communicate virtual space messages to a user s contact in accordance with such user specified parameters. In some implementations the message module may be configured to generate and communicate the virtual space messages in response to determinations that both the user and the contact are present in the virtual space as determined by the user presence module.

In some implementations system may include a system server and or any other components. The system server may be configured to communicate with one or more client computing platforms according to a client server architecture. The system server may communicate with a virtual space server through any suitable communication channels such as but not limited to application programming interface API web interface including CGI WSGI and or any other suitable communication channels. The users may access system and or the virtual space via client computing platforms . System server may be configured to execute one or more computer program modules. The one or more computer program modules may include user module contact list module contact entry module user presence module message module and or other modules.

The user module may be configured to obtain user information of individual users of the virtual space. The obtained virtual space user information may include information stored by virtual space server one or more of the client computing platforms external resources e.g. telecommunication services internet service email services providers and or any other external resources and or other storage locations. The obtained virtual space user information may include for example information identifying users e.g. a username or handle a number an identifier and or other identifying information within the virtual space security login information e.g. a login code or password virtual space account information subscription information virtual currency account information e.g. related to currency held in credit for a user relationship information e.g. information related to relationships between users in the virtual space virtual space usage information demographic information associated with users interaction history among users in the virtual space information stated by users purchase information of users browsing history of users a client computing platform identification associated with a user a phone number and or email address associated with a user and or other information related to users.

To obtain such user information the user module may be configured to interface with the virtual space client computing platforms external resources and or any other storage locations through any suitable wired and or wireless communication channels. The interfaces may include for example but not limited to application programming interface API CGI or WSGI and or any other communication methods facilitated by the virtual space server external resources and or client computing platform for retrieving the virtual space user information.

The contact list module may be configured to obtain contact lists associated with the users of the virtual space. The obtained contact lists may include but not limited to user contact lists stored by the virtual space server address books stored on the client computing platforms e.g. electronic phone book stored on smartphones of the users contact information stored by software implemented on client computing platform e.g. contact information stored by email clients implemented on the client computing platforms contact files stored on the client computing platforms e.g. spreadsheet files contact registers stored by internet service providers e.g. cloud computing services internet communication services etc. contact information provided by telecommunication service providers e.g. wireless service phone service etc. contact lists stored by email service providers and or any other contact lists. The obtained contact lists may comprise one or more contact entries providing information about contacts in relation to the owners of the obtained contact lists. The information about a contact as provided by a contact entry may indicate but not limited to a name of the contact one or more telephone numbers e.g. work phone home phone cell phone etc. associated with the contact one or more email addresses associated with the contact one or more real world addresses e.g. home address work address mailing address residence address etc. associated with the contact a relationship with the owner of the contact list e.g. friend relative co worker classmate etc. a group status as classified by the owner of the contact list e.g. a member of close circle a member of co workers at a company the owner of the contact list works at a member of classmates at a school the owner of the contact list attends etc. records of communications between the contact and owner of the contact list e.g. time and duration of the communications content of the individual communications e.g. actual email messages text messages chat sessions etc. between the contact and owner of the contact list and or any other information about the contact.

The contact list module may be configured to obtain such contact lists from the virtual space server client computing platforms and or external resources . For individual users the virtual space sever may manage contact lists for users of the virtual space. For example virtual space users contact lists may be managed by the virtual space server and stored in one or more user databases connected to the virtual space sever . In some examples users contact lists may be obtained by the contact list module from individual computing platforms associated with individual users of the virtual space. Software modules may be executed on a client computing platforms associated with a virtual space user for providing contact list s of the virtual space user e.g. by retrieving contact lists stored on the client computing platform . In those examples the contact list module may be configured to communicate with the user client computing platforms via such software modules to obtain the contact lists. In some examples users contact lists may be obtained by the contact list module from external resources e.g. such as but not limited to email service providers internet email and or intranet email service providers telecommunication service providers wireless phone etc. internet service providers e.g. online chat services conference services voice communication services and or any other internet service providers and or any other external resources . For obtaining the contact lists from such external resources the contact list module may be configured to communicate with the external resources using application programming interfaces API web interfaces and or any other communication methods provided by the external resources for obtaining the contact lists. For example user credentials of the external resources may be provided by the contact list module through the API provided by an external resource and upon verification of the user credentials the external resource may push the contact list associated with that user stored on the external resource to the system server via the contact list module .

The contact entry module may be configured to obtain contact entries from the contact lists and correlate the contact entries with users in the virtual space. For obtaining individual contact entries included in a contact list obtained by the contact list module the contact entry module may be configured with semantics such as but not limited to information indicating delimiters that separate individual contact entries in a contact list e.g. such delimiters may be specified by the source of the contact list and may include but not limited to tabs slashes commas semi colons and or any other delimiters that may be used to separate contact entries in a contact list and or any other semantics to parse the contact list. For correlating individual entries in a contact list with corresponding virtual space users the contact entry module may be configured to extract identifying information such as but not limited to the name the telephone number email address es real world address es and or any other identifying information of a contact from a contact entry. For such extractions delimiter information that separates individual fields in the contact entry and syntax for recognizing such identifying information e.g. telephone number comprises all numbers email addresses comprise an symbol real world address comprise a street name city state province and or a zip code etc. may be configured with the contact entry module by the provider administrator moderator and or any other entities related to the system server .

The contact entry module may be configured to compare the extracted identifying information of a contact entry with user information obtained by the user module . A correlation may be made by the contact entry module in cases where the extracted identifying information of a contact entry corresponds to user information of a user in a virtual space. For example the user information may comprise information indicating a telephone number an email address a real world address and or any other user information that corresponds to the telephone number email address real world address and or any other corresponding identifying information extracted from a contact entry in an obtained contact list. In this way the contact may be correlated with the user in the virtual space by the contact entry module .

In some examples the contact entry module may be configured to determine a relationship between users of the virtual space based on the contact information obtained from the contact entries. In some cases the obtained contact entries may comprise information readily indicate a relationship between the contact and the owner of the contact list. For example the contact entry may indicate that contact A is a friend classmate co worker relative or any other relationships as specified by the owner of the contact list. In those cases the contact entry module may simply employ such relationship information provided by the contact entry and determine that the relationship between the two virtual space users i.e. one corresponding to the owner of the contact list and the other corresponds to the contact as correlated by the contact entry module . In some cases the contact entry may not readily provide information indicating such a relationship between the contact and owner of the contact list. In those cases the contact entry module may be configured to parse actual communications for a determination of a relationship between the contact and owner of the contact list. For example the contact entry module may be configured with semantics to parse email messages between the contact and contact list owner for such a relationship determination e.g. the contact entry module may be configured to detect salutations in the email messages to determine a relationship between the contact and contact list owner.

In some examples the contact entry module may be configured to determine that a virtual space user was introduced to join the virtual space by another user based on the contact information extracted from a given contact entry. For such determinations the contact entry module may be configured with semantics such as but not limited to keywords promotion code patterns and or any other any other semantics for determining from the communications included in a given contact entry such a virtual space induction relationship. For example the contact entry module may be configured to parse email text chat and or any other messages included in the contact entries and detect keywords such as but not limited to join the virtual space join me in the virtual space let s play and the like promotion codes and or invitation templates provided by the provider of the virtual space for users to invite their contacts to join the virtual space and or any other information indicating that a virtual space user i.e. the contact was introduced to join the virtual space through communications by another virtual space user i.e. the owner of the contact list .

The user presence module may be configured determine users being present in the virtual space provided by the virtual space server . For such determinations in some examples the user presence module may send queries to the virtual space server at a sampling rate predetermined by the developer provider administrator and or any other entities related to the system server . Simultaneously and or alternatively the user presence module may be configured to query the virtual space server dynamically for example in response to correlating contacts with virtual space users by the contact entry module . In any case the contact entry module may receive responses from the virtual space server for determinations whether individual users are present in the virtual space. For example the virtual space may respond with a list of all users who are present in the virtual space and the user presence module may parse that list to determine whether specific users are present in the virtual space.

The message module may be configured to generate virtual space messages to virtual space users based on the contact information indicated by the contact entries. The generated virtual space messages may facilitate social interaction mentorship friendship and or any other relationships between the two users within the virtual space. The facilitated social interaction may include messages to invite a contact of a virtual space user the contact being another user of the virtual space as correlated by the contact entry module to participate in virtual space activities such as but not limited to missions quests campaigns and or any other virtual space activities with the virtual space user to collaborate with the virtual space user in virtual space actions e.g. to transfer virtual space resources to the user to send troops to a virtual space location controlled by the user and or any other collaborations to compete with the virtual space user in the virtual space invitation to a battle challenge in a race e.g. can you beat me in a race etc. to engage in group activities with the virtual space user e.g. team play alliance activities roleplaying and or any other group activities and or to engage in any other social interactions with the user. The facilitated mentorship between the two users may include messages to suggest recommend or otherwise inform the user s contact on behalf the virtual space user virtual space groups to join e.g. recommending specific alliances for the contact to join activities to participate e.g. recommending quests missions campaigns and or any other virtual space activities so that the contact may further his her progress in the virtual space efficiently actions to take e.g. build specific infrastructures order of building such infrastructures certain monsters to kill and or any other virtual space actions that the contact should engage in to his her progress in the virtual space efficiently virtual space item to acquire e.g. to purchase certain useful virtual space items from the virtual store operated by the provider of the virtual space to craft certain items etc. virtual space topology information e.g. specific virtual space locations routes direction for traversing in the virtual space tips about the virtual space and or any other information that may help the contact to further his her progression in the virtual space.

In any case the message module may be configured to generate such virtual space messages based on the contact information as obtained by the contact entry . For example the message module may be configured to generate messages on behalf of the virtual space user to one or more his her contacts who are also users of the virtual space. The messages may facilitate social interactions between the virtual space user and his her contacts. For instance the generated message may invite on behalf of the virtual space user his her contacts to join a quest mission or campaign in the virtual space with the user. The messages may facilitate mentorship between the user and his her contacts. For instance the generated message may recommend the contacts to join an alliance the user belongs to to build certain infrastructure and or any other virtual space information that may help further the contacts progression in the virtual space. In some examples the messages may simply facilitate friendship between the user and his her contacts by for example welcoming the contacts to the virtual space.

In some implementations the message module may be configured to generate the virtual space message to a user s contacts who are also virtual space users based on relationships between the user and the contacts as indicated by the contact information obtained from the contact list of the virtual space user. For example in cases where the contact information indicates a contact as a friend of the user messages to invite the contacts for example to collaborate with the virtual space user in the virtual space to engage in group activities in the virtual space and or to engage in any other interactions with the virtual space user in the virtual space. In another example in cases where the contact was introduced to join the virtual space by the user the message module may be configured to generate a message recommending virtual space activities items actions and or any other virtual space information to the contact for mentoring. In still another example in cases where the contact is a co worker of the user the message module may be configured to generate a message to challenge the contact in the virtual space e.g. without limitation to compete in a race with the virtual space user in the virtual space.

In some implementations the message module may be configured to determine a communication medium through which a generated message by the message module may be communicated to the contact based on the contact information obtained from the contact list of the virtual space user. Such a communication medium may include communication means provided by the virtual space and or communication means external to the virtual space. The communication medium provided by the virtual space may include but not limited to virtual space email system chat system virtual space notification system e.g. notifications in the virtual space interface implemented on client computing platforms and or any other virtual space communication means. The external communication means may include email services provided a third party e.g. internet email service provider texting services provided by a telecommunication service provider e.g. wireless texting voice mail services provided by a third party provider e.g. internet voice services and or any other external communication means. In some determinations the message module may be configured to determine an optimal communication medium for communicating the generated message to the contact based on the contact information obtained from the contact list associated with the virtual space user. For example in cases where the communication record information indicates that the contact and the virtual space user have engaged in communications most often through texting the message module may determine that the generated message to that contact should be communicated via texting on behalf of the virtual space user.

In some implementations user interfaces may be provided to facilitate virtual space users to specify preferred ways e.g. email text voice mail etc. to communicate with his her contacts who are also virtual space users frequencies at which to communicate with the contacts type of messages for the communication e.g. for contact A send mentorship type message for Contact B send collaboration type message for Contact C send competition message and so on and or any other parameters for the message module . In those implementations the message module may generate and communicate virtual space messages to a user s contact in accordance with such user specified parameters.

In some implementations the message module may be configured to generate and communicate the virtual space messages in response to determinations that both the user and the contact are present in the virtual space as determined by the user presence module . For example the message module may send a message to invite an online contact of an online user to participate in a quest such that both users may engage in the quest together instantly.

A given virtual space server may include one or more processors configured to execute computer program modules which may execute and implement an instance of the virtual space for interaction.
