The subject matter discussed herein relates generally to data processing and more particularly to systems and methods for attribute based user data visualizations.

A user s history of using a product or service if allowed by the user to be preserved is typically provided or presented to the user upon request in a sequential list of text. The user would need to peruse the text to identify information of interest.

To identify information from multiple sources of usage history i.e. the history of using multiple products and or services a user would need to peruse multiple sources of information. For example if a user wants to know what he or she did last summer the user would need to piece together information from different sources if the information was being preserved.

The subject matter includes methods for attribute based user data visualizations including determining that an event is associated with a category the event being one of a plurality of events that are associated with a user using one or more products clustering the event with a group of events that are associated with the category identifying at least a portion of the group of events and at least a portion of another group of events of another category based on one or more time periods and providing the at least the portion of the group of events and the at least the portion of the another group of events of the another category for visual presentation.

The methods are implemented using one or more computing devices and or systems. The methods may be stored in computer readable media.

The subject matter described herein is taught by way of example implementations. Various details have been omitted for the sake of clarity and to avoid obscuring the subject matter. The examples shown below are directed to structures and functions for implementing systems and methods for attribute based user data visualizations.

User data may include temporal information e.g. time stamped data and can be associated with a timeline. For example user data may include data in a time period e.g. one day one hour etc. which includes smaller time periods such as a time period . Data in time period may be conceptually shown as data . Each frame or box of data shows data associated with an event or activity e.g. an action an operation a communication a file a system event etc. .

In some example implementations two or more related events or activities may be grouped as an incident. For example a request for a file a transmission of the file a record stored indicating the transmission of the file etc. may be recorded as a download incident. A search for New Bay Bridge the viewing of information relating to New Bay Bridge a sharing on a social network of an image of New Bay Bridge etc. may be grouped as an incident.

Data show that data may be named grouped clustered or otherwise categorized. Data are shown categorized into for example four groups or categories represented by A B C and D. For example event activity or incident collectively event is categorized as A and so is event . Event is categorized as C. Event is categorized as B and so on.

Events may be categorized automatically by a computing system e.g. by hardware logic an operating system software application any combination etc. without user intervention . For example a system may automatically create and or maintain groups categories. Categories may be created based on categorization established in the system for other areas e.g. usage reports resource allocations etc. based on existing or available categorization based on products and services based on partnership with other service providers based on understanding of data e.g. the content of the data the metadata of the data the headings titles of the data etc. and or based on other factors. Example categories include but are not limited to searching emailing video chatting texting blogging video sharing photo sharing social network calendar cloud storage music maps reviews e.g. products services movies etc. recommendations e.g. restaurant etc. mobile device applications wallet shopping etc.

In some implementations users e.g. end users and or administrators may add delete modify define and redefine categories and or sub categories. For example some categories may be defined or entered by administrators or programmer e.g. searching emailing texting blogging social network calendar music maps etc. If a user s input is used to alter or redefine a category or sub category e.g. a system created category modified by a user the user input may be learned by the system for use in other categories and or sub categories. For example a user may redefine or further break down the searching category to include general searching searching for recommendations product searching etc. The system may learn from the user s input and apply the redefined categorization on one or more other categories e.g. emailing and blogging such as general emailing emailing regarding recommendations emailing regarding products etc. . The system may ask the user to confirm using the user s input for one category in another category e.g. a user interface not shown that asks the user confirm applying the user s input in one or more categories .

A user may define modify and or add one or more sub categories of any level. For example for the category of online storage or cloud storage a user may define sub categories based on content of the user s files and data stored online e.g. images music video work related personal career studies etc. . A user may create a category or sub category on the fly. For example as the user upload a file to an online storage service the user may create a category or sub category e.g. via a provided mechanism or user interface not shown and provide a label or name for the category or sub category e.g. Pets .

Data of time period may be presented visually in for example a window . Window may show for example the time spent connected by the user between T and T. The time spent connected may include data or events in a number of categories including events A B C and D for example. Events A i.e. events of category A are clustered around time T. Events B T events C T and event D T for example. Event A may be Studying for finals which may be a user modified or defined category e.g. the user identifies activities within a time period to be included in the category . Events B may be Summer job and events C Vacation to Paris for example. Example events such as Vacation to Paris or Trip to Paris are further described in below.

The user may see the underlying data of a category e.g. A or perform one or more operation to that category of data by selecting the category of data. For example the user may select the events A to see how many hours the user has spent in that category. In window events A are shown with a box and the term 13 hours . The legend or label for the event A Studying for finals may also be highlighted e.g. with a box or a different color background not shown . The user may select some events A and change their category e.g. to C and select events of other categories or non categorized data and label them events A. The system may learn from the user s changing of event categorization and apply the learning to existing categorization of data and or future categorization of data.

Data or events not labeled e.g. data between events A and B may be not categorized be categorized but not selected to be shown e.g. not selected by the user be categorized but not meeting a showing threshold or be hidden for other reasons.

Pie chart shows that events of a category e.g. Reading News may be presented in sub categories visually. For example when the user selects the Reading News bar in May the Breakdown of News read in May 2011 may be presented in sub categories in pie chart or another chart graph or visualization not shown . Pie chart shows for example the category of Reading News includes five sub categories . There may be other sub categories not shown because the user is not interested in viewing e.g. not selected to be shown or selected to be hidden and or not meeting showing thresholds. Examples of some of the sub categories include entertainment news finance news sports technology news etc.

In some example environments multiple sources of data e.g. user data from two or more products and or services may be grouped in one category or . After prompting or otherwise obtaining the user s permission to use his or her data from different sources these data may be grouped in one or more categories which may be modified by the user. For example one source of user data may be location data e.g. the user allows the use of the user s location information such as internet protocol IP address global positioning system GPS coordinates or the like from one or more of devices used by the user. Another source of data the user allows to use may be the user s calendar data or the user s uploaded photos.

The Trip to Paris event may be formed automatically by the system for example with the user s calendar entries that show arriving and or departing Paris on certain dates. The user s location data may show that the user was in Paris or the vicinity of Paris during those dates. Or the user s uploaded photos may be labeled as Paris photos. Events from these sources may be categorized based on their association with the word Paris. The user may modify the Trip to Paris category by for example adding sources of data adding events to the categories or removing events from the category. The user may also create the Trip to Paris category based on relative attributes by for example identifying events of different sources within a time period and label the event as Trip to Paris. 

The Trip to Moscow event and the College Days event may be similarly as the Trip to Paris event described above.

In some examples process may be implemented with different fewer or more blocks. Process may be implemented as computer executable instructions which can be stored on a medium loaded onto one or more processors of one or more computing devices and executed as a computer implemented method.

An example of one or more devices may be computing device described below in . Devices may include but are not limited to a computer e.g. a laptop computing device a mobile device e.g. smartphone or tablet a television a device associated with a vehicle a server computer computing devices storage devices and .

In some implementations devices may be considered user devices e.g. devices used by users to access services and or issue requests such as on a social network . Devices may be devices associated with service providers e.g. used by service providers to provide services and or store data such as webpages text text portions images image portions audios audio segments videos video segments and or information thereabout .

For example a user may access view and or provide input to his or her product usage history using user device or . The user s product usage history may be stored on one or more devices and provided visually by device .

Computing device can be communicatively coupled to input user interface and output device interface . Either one or both of input user interface and output device interface can be a wired or wireless interface and can be detachable. Input user interface may include any device component sensor or interface physical or virtual that can be used to provide input e.g. buttons touch screen interface keyboard a pointing cursor control microphone camera braille motion sensor optical reader and or the like . Output device interface may include a display television monitor printer speaker braille or the like. In some example implementations input user interface and output device interface can be embedded with or physically coupled to the computing device . In other example implementations other computing devices may function as or provide the functions of input user interface and output device interface for a computing device .

Examples of computing device may include but are not limited to highly mobile devices e.g. smartphones devices in vehicles and other machines devices carried by humans and animals and the like mobile devices e.g. tablets notebooks laptops personal computers portable televisions radios and the like and devices not designed for mobility e.g. desktop computers other computers information kiosks televisions with one or more processors embedded therein and or coupled thereto radios and the like .

Computing device can be communicatively coupled e.g. via I O interface to external storage and network for communicating with any number of networked components devices and systems including one or more computing devices of the same or different configuration. Computing device or any connected computing device can be functioning as providing services of or referred to as a server client thin server general machine special purpose machine or another label.

I O interface can include but is not limited to wired and or wireless interfaces using any communication or I O protocols or standards e.g. Ethernet 802.11x Universal System Bus WiMax modem a cellular network protocol and the like for communicating information to and or from at least all the connected components devices and network in computing environment . Network can be any network or combination of networks e.g. the Internet local area network wide area network a telephonic network a cellular network satellite network and the like .

Computing device can use and or communicate using computer usable or computer readable media including transitory media and non transitory media. Transitory media include transmission media e.g. metal cables fiber optics signals carrier waves and the like. Non transitory media include magnetic media e.g. disks and tapes optical media e.g. CD ROM digital video disks Blu ray disks solid state media e.g. RAM ROM flash memory solid state storage and other non volatile storage or memory.

Computing device can be used to implement techniques methods applications processes or computer executable instructions in some example computing environments. Computer executable instructions can be retrieved from transitory media and stored on and retrieved from non transitory media. The executable instructions can originate from one or more of any programming scripting and machine languages e.g. C C C Java Visual Basic Python Perl JavaScript and others .

Processor s can execute under any operating system OS not shown in a native or virtual environment. One or more applications can be deployed that include logic unit application programming interface API unit input unit output unit category management clustering unit presentation unit and inter unit communication mechanism for the different units to communicate with each other with the OS and with other applications not shown . For example category management clustering unit and presentation unit may implement one or more processes and or user interfaces shown and described in . The described units and elements can be varied in design function configuration or implementation and are not limited to the descriptions provided.

In some example implementations when information or an execution instruction is received by API unit it may be communicated to one or more other units e.g. logic unit input unit output unit category management clustering unit and presentation unit . For example after input unit has detected a user request for accessing the user s data e.g. product usage history etc. input unit may use API unit to communicate the user request to category management . category management may via API unit interact with the clustering unit to identify events and create clusters of events based on categories. Using API unit category management may interact with presentation unit to provide some or all of the clusters events for visual presentation.

In some instances logic unit may be configured to control the information flow among the units and direct the services provided by API unit input unit output unit category management clustering unit and presentation unit in some example implementations described above. For example the flow of one or more processes or implementations may be controlled by logic unit alone or in conjunction with API unit .

In situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users or may make use of personal information the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information e.g. information about a user s social network social actions or activities profession a user s preferences or a user s current location or to control whether and or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example a user s identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user or a user s geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained such as to a city ZIP code or state level so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.
