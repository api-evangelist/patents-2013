title: Connection device and protocol
abstract: A common communications protocol is described among devices in a unified communications network. Native devices receive upstream commands and forward them to downstream devices without interpreting the commands. The native devices reformat commands intended for mapped devices in the unified communications network. The common communications protocol calls for left shifting address fields for transmitted commands until the command arrives at its intended destination.

This application is a divisional application of U.S. Utility application Ser. No. 12 828 655 filed Jul. 1 2010 entitled Connection Device and Protocol which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

Embodiments of the invention relate to systems and methods for communications among the devices in a network. More particularly an embodiment of the invention relates to systems and methods that employ a communications protocol that simplifies communications among devices in a communications network where the devices employ a variety of communication mechanisms to facilitate their communications.

Unified communications represents an important component of productivity in contemporary business culture and its success from company to company can serve as a bellwether indicator of the company s overall management success. An essential feature behind unified communications is the ability to have a single way for reaching an employee. Thus in a fully configured unified communications environment all messages to an employee regardless of the format of their origin e.g. e mail will reach the employee at the earliest possible moment via another format e.g. SMS if necessary.

Unified communications may include the integration of real time communication services e.g. instant messaging with non real time communication services e.g. SMS . Unified communications systems typically comprise not a single system but the integration of data from a potentially unlimited set of separate communications devices and systems.

As a further representative example unified communications permits one party e.g. a co worker to send a message on one medium and have it received by another party on another medium. This process effectively transfers an activity from one communications medium to another. For example a message recipient could receive an e mail message from a co worker and access it through a mobile phone.

Presence information refers to the combination of the availability of a communication recipient to be able to receive a message and that person s willingness to speak. For example if the message sender is online according to the presence information and currently accepts calls the response can be sent immediately through text chat or video call. Otherwise the communication may be sent as a non real time message that can be accessed through a variety of media. Thus presence information typically represents a status indicator that conveys ability and willingness of a potential communication partner.

Difficulties arise in producing a unified view of data such as presence information when a party s communication media are spread across multiple and or overlapping systems. When a user s communications environment comprises multiple devices not all of which are aware of the others then the unity among the devices of the user s communications network is incomplete. So for example a party s laptop computer might not know about the same user s mobile telephone. Consequently the mobile telephone is not joined into the same effective communications network as the other devices associated with the laptop computer and a presence system cannot integrate the mobile phone into the unified communications environment.

No protocol presently exists that can be used to facilitate communications between a personal computer PC a Bluetooth device a DECT device and or Wi Fi device without translating from one set of supported commands to another. Consider the example of a PC application that communicates to a dongle through defined HID events and the dongle communicates with a headset over Bluetooth. In this example commands that are sent by the PC are terminated on the dongle. The dongle itself must determine whether the commands are required to enable dongle functionality or to enable headset functionality. If the command is for the headset the dongle must maintain a copy of the state of the headset in order to provide the appropriate Bluetooth command to the headset.

To make the situation even worse if an additional feature is added to the headset and the PC then intervening communications devices such as the dongle would also need to be updated in order to provide the functionality.

Unified communications has analogs in the home consumer market as well. A home user may want to watch a television program or surf the Internet uninterrupted provided that an incoming message is from anyone other than a specific person. The home user may be able control devices e.g. a wired telephone associated with the home cable network to implement the desired message routing but this home cable network has no control over devices outside its network e.g. the same person s mobile telephone .

Attempts to solve this problem in the prior art have tended to be either overly complicated overly expensive or both. For example one of the preferred solutions in the prior art has been to supply all networked devices with complete topology information. This approach provides a working solution of sorts but unfortunately requires a tremendous amount of administrative overhead. Not only must every device understand the protocols for every device that could theoretically be connected into the network each device has to be routinely updated to accommodate protocol updates in all of those devices.

Other solutions have proven equally inadequate or inappropriate for providing a robust unified communications systems. A simple and robust solution is called for in order to make unified communications more robust and ubiquitous.

Embodiments of the invention provide a computerized network comprising a protocol manager in a computer configured to coordinate communications among a plurality of associated devices by sending messages to associated devices in the plurality of associated devices wherein the messages sent utilize a plurality of communication mechanisms. The computerized network further comprises a first associated device electronically coupled to the protocol manager and configured to receive communications from the protocol manager wherein the first associated device is further configured to interrogate a message address of a received communication and forward the message automatically to another associated device of the plurality of associated devices unless the message address indicates that the message is intended for the first associated device. The computerized network also includes a second associated device electronically coupled to the first associated device and configured to receive communications from the protocol manager wherein the second associated device is further configured to interrogate a message address of a received communication and forward the message automatically to another associated device of the plurality of associated devices unless the message address indicates that the message is intended for the second associated device. The computerized network additionally includes a third associated device electronically coupled to the second associated device and configured to receive communications from the protocol manager.

Embodiments of the invention also provide a unified communications system comprising a computerized protocol manager resident in a computer the computerized protocol manager configured to access a first API translation unit and translate first device specific commands into a common protocol and further configured to access a second API translation unit and translate second device specific commands into the common protocol. The unified communications system also comprises a first device configured to receive commands formatted according to the common protocol sort received commands into commands intended for the first device and intended for another device among a plurality of devices and forward commands intended for another device of the plurality of devices. The unified communication system further comprises a second device configured to receive commands formatted according to the common protocol sort received commands into commands intended for the second device or intended for another device among a plurality of devices and forward commands intended for another device of the plurality of devices.

Embodiments of the invention provide a method for transmitting communications in a unified communications system. The method comprises accessing a first API translation unit by a computerized protocol manager in a computer and translating first device specific commands for a first device into a common protocol. The method further comprises accessing a second API translation unit by the computerized protocol manager and translating second device specific commands for a second device into the common protocol. The method also comprises receiving commands formatted in the common protocol from the protocol manager by a first device that sorts the received commands into commands intended for the first device or commands intended for another device of a plurality of devices and forwards commands intended for another device of the plurality of devices to the another device of the plurality of devices. The method also comprises receiving commands formatted in the common protocol by a second device that sorts the received commands into commands intended for the second device or commands intended for another device among a plurality of devices and forwards commands intended for another device of the plurality of devices to the another device.

Embodiments of the invention enable a virtually unlimited number of devices to be connected in a tiered tree style network. For example embodiments of the invention enable a personal computer to interrogate a conventional mobile phone via a USB dongle and a Bluetooth headset without requiring modifications to the conventional mobile phone.

Embodiments of the invention provide a relative topology for devices connected in a network. Thus a typical device has a parent node above it in a communication hierarchy and up to 7 nodes below it in the hierarchy according to an embodiment of the invention. Using this approach a device only needs to know the address of the device above it and the addresses for the devices below it in order to communicate with other devices throughout the network. In short a device needs to know just a relative topology and not the topology for the entire network. Intervening devices typically have little more to do than forward a command to the proper recipient above or below it.

Embodiments of the invention enable a device to send data commands and information to non native devices without requiring intermediate devices to understand translate or re interpret the information sent. Embodiments of the invention support and enhance the establishment of a unified communication system by incorporating distant and non network devices together into a common network. In short embodiments of the invention may further facilitate establishing a single way to reach a user regardless of which communication devices he happens to be near and or using.

Embodiments of the invention also enable communications across a variety of media types without each device in the system having to maintain network topology information about distant devices in the network. For example embodiments of the invention may ensure that commands which are destined for a specific dongle only terminate at that dongle while other commands may be forwarded through the dongle to other devices. Thus the dongle can forward headset specific commands to a headset without the dongle needing to understand the forwarded commands. Since devices need only forward commands and are not necessarily required to interpret the commands then it becomes possible to send instructions from a computer or other top node of the network to any other device on the network which is only understood by the target device. Finally embodiments of the invention should simplify the operation of the network and device interconnections. New commands can easily be added to any device on the topology without the need for any other devices to be upgraded.

The network may also include a wired telephone a mobile telephone and a headset according to an embodiment of the invention. The mobile telephone may include a Short Message Service SMS capability as well as other communications applications.

The computer the wired phone and the mobile phone are all connected to the communications network . While the computer would typically connect directly to the communication network via the Internet different connections are known in the art and may be employed within the spirit of the invention. The wired phone as shown in is connected to the computer and provides a device for communicating over the VOIP . As known in the art the wired phone could also connect to the communication network via the PSTN . While not shown here such a connection would be within the spirit of the invention.

A user associated with the network may communicate with other parties using the devices in the network e.g. the voice over internet protocol VOIP electronic mail email instant message the wired phone short message service SMS and the mobile phone . Communication messages may travel from one portion of the communications network to another portion of the communications network . For example a person on a wired phone connected to the PSTN may communicate with a user of the VOIP and vice versa and an SMS sent from a third party s mobile phone may arrive on the email system or the IM and vice versa.

The mobile telephone and its applications conventionally communicate directly with a mobile network associated with the communication network and the mobile telephone does not typically connect to the communication network via the computer but may connect with the headset to provide greater user comfort and or hands free use. The mobile telephone could alternatively connect to the communications network via the computer such as in conjunction with the VOIP . Wireless communications to the headset can be piped on a dongle to the computer and applications on the computer e.g. the VOIP . As discussed herein such an embodiment could be enabled via the headset for outbound calls on many models of mobile phones.

With the assistance of a mobile telephone operator associated with the mobile telephone an embodiment of the invention could also be enabled that would allow inbound calls to reach the mobile telephone via the Internet and routed through the computer . The mobile telephone operator would typically configure its systems to route inbound calls to the mobile telephone over the Internet to the VOIP or similar functionality . The VOIP would then route the calls to the mobile telephone via the headset .

The network may also include other types of communications devices . These other devices may include but are not limited to devices such as a personal digital assistant PDA and or a radio device such as a hand held radio transceiver. The other devices include may comprise both native devices and non native mapped devices as discussed below.

The various communication devices in the network may not originate from a common manufacturer and might not be organically configured to communicate universally with each other. In some instances the devices may be configured to communicate with each other only by virtue of the sharing of technical information between the respective manufacturers of the devices.

The headset typically has a greater intrinsic ability to communicate with other devices associated with the network . For example the manufacture of the mobile phone may provide sufficient information to enable the manufacturer of the headset to enable the two devices to communicate with each other. The headset may translate data and commands received from the computer before sending them to the mobile phone which is often a non native device for the computer . The manufacture of the mobile phone for example may have shared a key communications application program interface API with the manufacturer of the headset . Such corporate relationships may be somewhat tenuous and unsteady. Likewise the manufacturer of the headset may not necessarily receive changes updates to the communications protocols used by the mobile phone .

Embodiments of the invention provide a specialized communications protocol that facilitates communications among the devices in the network . This communication protocol dubbed here the Olympia Link Protocol provides an expandable network hierarchy according to an embodiment of the invention. The network topology in the network preferably comprises 4 layers of hierarchy but may be configured to have more or fewer layers within the spirit of the invention.

By employing the Olympia Link Protocol each physical device in the network only needs to connect to another physical device immediately above or below it according to an embodiment of the invention Implementations of the Olympia Link Protocol provide communication between indirectly attached devices using command forwarding via the intermediate levels according to an embodiment of the invention.

The protocol manager serves as a master control for the Olympia Link Protocol in the network according to an embodiment of the invention. Each supported device typically operates as a slave to the protocol manager at least with respect to communications within the network according to an embodiment of the invention. The native devices supported by the protocol manager are typically capable of two way communications with the protocol manager .

The Olympia Link Protocol does not typically need to specify the type of connection or communication mechanism between physical devices. The type of connection is independent of the Olympia Link Protocol. Accordingly physical devices may communicate using communication mechanisms such as USB HID DECT Bluetooth Wi Fi wUSB and Serial Port. The devices included in the network typically adhere to a variety of standard communications technology and protocols. If two devices both practice the same communication standard e.g. 802.11 then the two devices may be able to communicate with each other without additional re configuration being performed on either device.

The Olympia Link Protocol specifies an addressing structure such that only the recipient device in the network needs to understand commands sent to it. Other physical devices in the topology of the network merely need to forward commands and events to either the computer or the physical device recipient of a communication. Each native device merely needs to pass commands forward albeit perhaps on a different connection type as discussed above.

If the computer needs to communicate with the mobile phone the computer sends a message to the dongle using an appropriate communications protocol such as Universal Serial Bus USB . The dongle may convert the received command from a USB command to a command in another protocol such as a Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications DECT command and forward it to the headset . The dongle does not need to interpret the message. The headset may convert the received command from DECT to another communications protocol such as Bluetooth before forwarding the communication to the mobile phone . The headset does not otherwise need to interpret the command. The mobile phone receives the command and acts upon it.

Commands sent through the network may be encapsulated in a variety of formats including known formats such as ASCII according to an embodiment of the invention. The Olympia Link Protocol enables a common command protocol to be operated by all devices and reports connections and statuses of any device.

Operations of the protocol manager in carrying out the Olympia Link Protocol may be facilitated by API translation modules that each respectively provide an API for a given external device e.g. the dongle and include a translation for the API into a common API. The device manager may use an API translation module in implementing the Olympia Link Protocol according to an embodiment of the invention. For example the API translation module may provide a translation for the USB dongle .

The device manager controls the devices in the network and interacts with the protocol manager in preparing and sending commands to the devices within the network . The device manager has been configured to communicate directly with native devices in the network .

The protocol manager includes and or accesses a variety of manufacturer specific application programming interfaces APIs for at least some of the devices included in the network . The inclusion of an appropriate device API e.g. API translation module changes the device from a mapped device into a native device at least in terms of the protocol manager . When the protocol manager has access to a device s API then the protocol manager can translate manufacture specific commands into a common set of commands including commands that effectively implement the Olympia Link Protocol. This approach also provides a fairly simple capability for updating the protocol manager when one of the API s changes and also allows for the incorporation of new devices into the network as native devices.

The protocol manager has also been configured to obtain information such as status data from additional devices e.g. the mapped devices that are not directly connected to the device manager . So for example the protocol manager would typically be configured to obtain information from the mobile phone according to an embodiment of the invention.

A presence engine may retain presence information for the native devices within the communication range of the computer . In some embodiments of the invention the presence engine on the computer may also retain information for the non native mapped devices such as the mobile phone by using the relationship between the headset and the mobile phone .

Assume the routing multiplexer has received a communication from the upstream connection having an address 0000 . Since the initial integer in the address is 0 then the routing multiplexer passes the command along path to the device processor for processing on the physical device . Now assume that a communication received from the upstream connection has an address 4300. Since the initial integer in the address is something other than a 0 then the upstream command is intended for processing on another device downstream of the physical device . In this example the routing multiplexer determines that the downstream device is reachable via downstream connection which corresponds to the routing address 4 of 4300. Before forwarding the message along downstream connection the routing multiplexer left shifts the received address such that the downstream device found along the downstream connection will receive the address 3000 rather than 4300. Likewise this downstream device will find that the leading address digit is not 0 but a 3 and will forward the command to yet another downstream device having a connection address that corresponds to the 3 of 4300. 

The physical device may comprise any multipoint device according to an embodiment of the invention. The upstream connection and the downstream connections may represent any type of communications mechanism including mobile communications mechanisms like Wi Fi and Bluetooth. The physical device may also be configured to support a media connect device that allows new devices to be connected into a network topology such as the topology for the network in .

The routing multiplexer may process more than one upstream connection and may process more than 7 downstream connections in alternative embodiments of the invention. In still other embodiments of the invention the routing multiplexer may route to fewer than 7 downstream devices. The routing multiplexer may be comprised of specialized hardware configured to perform a multiplexing task or specialized computer software configured for such a task and or a hybrid that comprises both computing hardware and software working together to perform the routing function.

The network illustrated in depicts physical devices at their greatest possible extent along only one of seven topology paths top node to physical device to physical device to physical device and to the seven physical devices . The network could include up to 7 777 2 800 physical devices. Only 28 physical devices have been shown here for clarity purposes.

In a network where messages and commands are passed from one device to the next each physical device needs to have some information about the network s topology. As mentioned above one of the problems with conventional approaches is that each physical device in a network typically needs to know the topology for the entire network and how to communicate to each device in the network. The physical devices in the network need only know a relative network topology such as the topology shown in one respective upstream connection and up to seven respective downstream connections according to an embodiment of the invention.

As previously discussed the addressing scheme used in the Olympia Link Protocol comprises progressively left shifting a message s address until the address reaches a 0 which indicates the recipient of the communication who will be responsible for its processing. Following this scheme a physical device does not need to know where it lies within the network topology and only needs to know where it lies within the relative topology described in .

Assume that the devices connected in the network comprise the top node a first device e.g. the dongle a second device e.g. the headset and a third device e.g. the mobile telephone . Assume further that the connections between these devices comprise a first connection e.g. a USB connection between the top node and the first device a second connection e.g. Bluetooth connection between the first device and the second device and a third connection e.g. a Bluetooth connection between the second device and the third device

In this configuration communications travel from the protocol manager through the communication manager to the first device then to the second device and finally the third device . Of course not all communications will necessarily travel the entire length of the network . For example assume that the Olympia Link protocol on the device analyzes a received communication from the top node and determines that the address does not have a leading 0. The device left shifts the address of the received message by one place determines that that the communication has an address for the device and forwards the communication to the device using the connection . The device also determines that the message is destined elsewhere because the address does not have a leading 0. The device left shifts the address by one place and sends it to the device . The device is a mapped device and processes the received communication as if it originated from the device according to an embodiment of the invention.

A native devices area marks a zone in which the devices shown here as the dongle and the headset have an organic capability to support the Olympia Link Protocol. These native devices have a communications channel established with the protocol manager . Communications mechanisms configurable to support connections between native devices and the Presence Engine in the network include but are not limited to USB Bluetooth Wi Fi and DECT.

For a mapped device such as the mobile phone to be present in the network the device should have a connection to a native device. For example the mobile phone shown in is connected electronically to the headset . Examples of mapped devices include but are not limited to third party devices and legacy devices that have not been provided with the Olympia Link Protocol.

Each multiplexer essentially left shifts the received address after processing. Assume for example that the address is 4400 which will ultimately connect to the headset . The multiplexer identifies the leading 4 in the address and forwards the command to the dongle . Before forwarding the command the multiplexer left shift the address 4400 such that it now becomes 4000 . The dongle receives the message and the multiplexer identifies that the leading 4 in the address corresponds to the headset . The multiplexer left shifts the address 4000 before sending the command to the headset such that the address 4000 now becomes 0000. The headset receives a command having the address 0000. The multiplexer identifies the leading 0 in the command and forwards the command to the device processor for further processing.

A physical device receives a new communication step . The device examines the received communication step and asks if a leading portion of the address is 0 or another number step . If the address portion is 0 then this indicates that the message is a local message intended for the device itself. Accordingly the Olympia Link Protocol forwards the received communication to an appropriate processor e.g. the device processor within the physical device step and then returns to await additional inbound communications for processing.

If the communication has a leading address portion other than 0 step then the Olympia Link Protocol forwards the communication to the physical device having that address according to the physical device s network topology step . Before forwarding the communication to another physical device the Olympia Link Protocol left shifts the communication s address by one addressing increment step . So for example an address that was 3400 becomes 4000 according to an embodiment of the invention. After forwarding the communication step the Olympia Link Protocol then returns to wait for the next received communication step .

Although the Olympia Link Protocol has been designed primarily with business applications in mind embodiments of the invention may also find uses in consumer electronics applications as well particularly home entertainment and communications systems.

As shown in a home network comprises a set top box a television the wired phone the headset the mobile phone and the computer . The set top box connects to the communication network via a cable network . Devices connected downstream of the set top box may connect with other networks beyond the cable network . For example applications on the computer may connect through the set top box to the cable network and then to the Internet . The wired phone may connect to the set top box then to the cable network and then to the PSTN and or to the mobile network . The television may connect through the set top box to the cable network from which the television receives a television signal via a cable headend . Other configurations are also possible within the spirit of the invention.

The set top box serves as the top node e.g. the top node in the network topology for the network . In this embodiment the set top box includes a protocol manager configured to maintain network communications according to the Olympia Link Protocol. According to another embodiment of the invention the computer serves as the top node for the Olympia Link Protocol. One typical advantage for using the set top box as the top node in the network is that the set top box is typically the only device in the network that must remain switched on at all times in order for the network to function properly. The user may for example switch off the computer .

The headset may connect to the set top box . The connection may be via a Bluetooth device a wired connection or another type of connection. The headset may include functionality for communicating with and or complementing the wired phone . For example a call placed to the wired phone may be answered by the headset .

Communications may transpire among the devices shown in this network topology in a manner similar to that described above for the typical business environment described in . For example a user may receive a call via the mobile phone . Information such as the Caller ID associated with the call may pass through the headset to the set top box . The set top box may send the Caller ID to the television for display to the user. The user may actuate the headset and or his cable TV remote to either accept the call or send it to voicemail if the user does not want to be interrupted e.g. the user is watching a rugby final on the television and cannot be disturbed by his mother in law . The set top box may even include functionality that would allow the call to be received via the headset or the wired phone . In other words the user might be able to answer the mobile phone on the wired phone . This could be helpful in instances where the user s mobile phone has been placed in an inconvenient location. Conventional communications arrangements would typically allow the user to accept the call on the headset .

Thus without having his television program interrupted the user can see the Caller ID on his television screen and determine if he wants to take the call or send it to voicemail. The user could accept the call or reject the call by either operating the mobile phone or by operating his headset or his television remote control according to an embodiment of the invention. If the user accepts the call then the television may be configured to mute itself and the call would connect through the headset according to an embodiment of the invention.

Still further embodiments of the invention would allow the user to place an outbound call on the mobile phone via the cable network . So for example if the user s mobile phone is within range of a native device for the network then the user s outgoing mobile phone call could be intercepted and routed through the cable network . This configuration might provide the user with lower cost telephony services in some instances especially where the user s mobile telephone calls are individually charged while the user s wired or VOIP telephone calls are charged at a flat rate per month as is frequently an option with telephony services provided by cable operators.

The configuration shown in could also be used to provide a facility for displaying email IM and or SMS messages on the television . Such functionality could be enabled by using the Olympia Link Protocol in the manner described above for mobile telephony communications.

In a further embodiment of the invention the communication link typically provided between the mobile phone and the headset could be provided by other devices. In such an embodiment the mobile phone might be able to maintain communications directly with the set top box for example. In this embodiment the user would not necessarily need to have the headset in order for the overall network to integrate the mobile phone into the network . For example the network could be configured such that the user could answer mobile telephone calls via his cable remote control with audio sent through systems associated with the television .

While specific embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described it will be clear that the invention is not limited to these embodiments only. Numerous modifications changes variations substitutions and equivalents will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as described in the claims. In general in the following claims the terms used should not be construed to limit the invention to the specific embodiments disclosed in the specification but should be construed to include all systems and methods that operate under the claims set forth hereinbelow.
