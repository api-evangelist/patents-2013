This application claims priority to and is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 072 276 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 588 066 entitled Systems and Methods for Link Load Balancing on a Multi Core Device filed on Mar. 25 2011 which claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 317 776 entitled Systems and Methods For Link Load Balancing On A Multi Core Device filed on Mar. 26 2010 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.

The present application generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present application relates to systems and methods for link load balancing in a multi core system.

The present application is directed towards a solution for addressing the implementation and performance of link load balancing LLB and layer three 3 forwarding in a multiple core system such as a multi core device intermediary to a plurality of clients and servers. L3 forwarding involves route lookup based on a destination of the network packet. If this route is a link load balanced LLB route then an appropriate next hop is decided based on a load balancing decision. In case of persistency in a multi core device a core receiving the packet may not be the same core that owns or established the persistent session. In this case the receiving core may send a core to core message to the owner core to get the persistence information of the session. Since this process is asynchronous the device may hold the outgoing data structure referred to as an nsb until a reply is received from core to core message. A global array accessible by the cores may be used to hold the nsb using hash of four tuple as the index in the array. On receiving the reply of core to core message the receiving core can lookup the nsb based on hash of four tuple and the device will forward the nsb. Since persistence information is now available the nsb will be forwarded to the appropriate next hop.

In a further aspect at the time of allocation of a server side process control block pub network address translation pub the multi core device decides the source IP and source port of the connection based on the LLB route next hop. If persistency is enabled then it may be possible that a core is not the owner of the session and it may have to send Core to Core message to the owner core. If core to core message needs to be sent at the time of source IP and source port selection then the multi core device will allocate a port on a dummy internet protocol IP address. Connection pcb natpcb and nsb data structures are created with the dummy IP as the source IP and port on dummy IP as the source port. This nsb will follow normal routing as LLB decision is not yet taken. On receiving a core to core reply the following actions take place 

In some aspects the present solution is directed to a method for link load balancing by a multi core intermediary device a plurality of Internet links. The method may include load balancing by a multi core device intermediary to a plurality of devices and a plurality of Internet links network traffic across the plurality of Internet links. The multi core device providing persistence of network traffic to a selected Internet link based on a persistence type. A first core of the multi core device receives a packet to be transmitted via an Internet link to be selected from the plurality of Internet links. The first core sends to a second core of the multi core device a request for persistence information responsive to identifying that the second core is an owner core of a session for persistence based on the persistence type. The first core receives the persistence information from the second core and determines to transmit the packet to the Internet link previously selected based on the persistence information received from the second core.

In some embodiments the multi core device load balances outbound network traffic across the plurality of Internet links based on a load balancing method of either round robin destination hash least packets or least bandwidth. The multi core device may provide persistence of network traffic to the selected Internet link based on the persistence type comprising persistence based on a source internet protocol address of the packet. Persistence of network traffic to the selected Internet link may be based on the persistence type comprising persistence based on a source internet protocol address a destination internet protocol address of the packet.

In some embodiments a virtual server executing on the first core receives the packet for the session created by the second core. The first core may determine that the second core is the owner of the session based on a hash of tuple information of the packet. The first core may determine that the second core is the owner of the session based on a core identifier encoded in a session identifier of the packet. The first core may send to the second core a core to core message comprising the request. The first core may received from the second core a core to core message comprising a response having the persistence information.

The first core may receive persistence information comprising identification of the Internet link selection for the session. The first core may forward the packet via a link load balanced route for the session based on the persistence information.

In some aspects the present solution is directed to a method for link load balancing by a multi core intermediary device a plurality of Internet links. The method includes load balancing by a multi core device intermediary to a plurality of devices and a plurality of Internet links network traffic across the plurality of Internet links the multi core device providing persistence of network traffic to a selected Internet link based on a persistence type. A first core of the multi core device receives a packet having a destination via an Internet link to be selected from the plurality of Internet links The first core identifies that persistence is enabled for a virtual server of the multi core device that provides the load balancing. The first core sends to a second core of the multi core device a request for persistence information responsive to identifying that the second core is an owner core of a session of the packet. The first core receives the persistence information for the session of the packet from the second core and selects the source IP address and source port for the packet based on the persistence information.

In some embodiments the multi core device load balances outbound network traffic across the plurality of Internet links based on a load balancing method of round robin destination hash least packets or least bandwidth. The multi core device may provide persistence of network traffic to the selected Internet link based on the persistence type comprising persistence based on a source internet protocol address of the packet. The multi core device may provide persistence of network traffic to the selected Internet link based on the persistence type comprising persistence based on a source internet protocol address a destination internet protocol address of the packet.

In some embodiments the first core assigns a dummy internet protocol IP address as a source IP and a dummy port number as a source port for a connection for the packet. The first core determines that the second core is the owner of the session based on a hash of tuple information of the packet. The first core receives persistence information comprising information identifying the Internet link selected for the session. The first core selects the source IP address and the source port based on link load balancing route information received via the persistence information.

In some embodiments functional parallelism may be referred to as task parallelism and may be achieved when each processor or core executes a different process or function on the same or different data. The core or processor may execute the same or different code. In some cases different execution threads or code may communicate with one another as they work. Communication may take place to pass data from one thread to the next as part of a workflow.

In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to functional parallelism can comprise distributing network traffic according to a particular function such as network input output management NW I O A secure sockets layer SSL encryption and decryption B and transmission control protocol TCP functions C. This may lead to a work performance or computing load based on a volume or level of functionality being used. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to data parallelism can comprise distributing an amount of work based on distributing data associated with a particular hardware or software component. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to flow based data parallelism can comprise distributing data based on a context or flow such that the amount of work A N on each core may be similar substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed.

In the case of the functional parallelism approach each core may be configured to run one or more functionalities of the plurality of functionalities provided by the packet engine or VIP of the appliance. For example core may perform network I O processing for the appliance while core performs TCP connection management for the appliance. Likewise core may perform SSL offloading while core may perform layer 7 or application layer processing and traffic management. Each of the cores may perform the same function or different functions. Each of the cores may perform more than one function. Any of the cores may run any of the functionality or portions thereof identified and or described in conjunction with . In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of performance or load .

In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of load or performance.

The functionality or tasks may be distributed in any arrangement and scheme. For example illustrates a first core Core A processing applications and processes associated with network I O functionality A. Network traffic associated with network I O in some embodiments can be associated with a particular port number. Thus outgoing and incoming packets having a port destination associated with NW I O A will be directed towards Core A which is dedicated to handling all network traffic associated with the NW I O port. Similarly Core B is dedicated to handling functionality associated with SSL processing and Core D may be dedicated handling all TCP level processing and functionality.

While illustrates functions such as network I O SSL and TCP other functions can be assigned to cores. These other functions can include any one or more of the functions or operations described herein. For example any of the functions described in conjunction with may be distributed across the cores on a functionality basis. In some cases a first VIP A may run on a first core while a second VIP B with a different configuration may run on a second core. In some embodiments each core can handle a particular functionality such that each core can handle the processing associated with that particular function. For example Core B may handle SSL offloading while Core D may handle application layer processing and traffic management.

In other embodiments work load or network traffic may be distributed among cores according to any type and form of data parallelism . In some embodiments data parallelism may be achieved in a multi core system by each core performing the same task or functionally on different pieces of distributed data. In some embodiments a single execution thread or code controls operations on all pieces of data. In other embodiments different threads or instructions control the operation but may execute the same code. In some embodiments data parallelism is achieved from the perspective of a packet engine vServers VIPs A C network interface cards NIC D E and or any other networking hardware or software included on or associated with an appliance . For example each core may run the same packet engine or VIP code or configuration but operate on different sets of distributed data. Each networking hardware or software construct can receive different varying or substantially the same amount of data and as a result may have varying different or relatively the same amount of load .

In the case of a data parallelism approach the work may be divided up and distributed based on VIPs NICs and or data flows of the VIPs or NICs. In one of these approaches the work of the multi core system may be divided or distributed among the VIPs by having each VIP work on a distributed set of data. For example each core may be configured to run one or more VIPs. Network traffic may be distributed to the core for each VIP handling that traffic. In another of these approaches the work of the appliance may be divided or distributed among the cores based on which NIC receives the network traffic. For example network traffic of a first NIC may be distributed to a first core while network traffic of a second NIC may be distributed to a second core. In some cases a core may process data from multiple NICs.

While illustrates a single vServer associated with a single core as is the case for VIP1 A VIP2 B and VIP3 C. In some embodiments a single vServer can be associated with one or more cores . In contrast one or more vServers can be associated with a single core . Associating a vServer with a core may include that core to process all functions associated with that particular vServer. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code and configuration. In other embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code but different configuration. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having different code and the same or different configuration.

Like vServers NICs can also be associated with particular cores . In many embodiments NICs can be connected to one or more cores such that when a NIC receives or transmits data packets a particular core handles the processing involved with receiving and transmitting the data packets. In one embodiment a single NIC can be associated with a single core as is the case with NIC D and NIC E. In other embodiments one or more NICs can be associated with a single core . In other embodiments a single NIC can be associated with one or more cores . In these embodiments load could be distributed amongst the one or more cores such that each core processes a substantially similar amount of load. A core associated with a NIC may process all functions and or data associated with that particular NIC.

While distributing work across cores based on data of VIPs or NICs may have a level of independency in some embodiments this may lead to unbalanced use of cores as illustrated by the varying loads of .

In some embodiments load work or network traffic can be distributed among cores based on any type and form of data flow. In another of these approaches the work may be divided or distributed among cores based on data flows. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approaches.

In flow based data parallelism distribution of data is related to any type of flow of data such as request response pairings transactions sessions connections or application communications. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. The distribution of data flow may be such that each core carries a substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed amount of load data or network traffic.

In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approached. In one embodiment data flow can be distributed based on a transaction or a series of transactions. This transaction in some embodiments can be between a client and a server and can be characterized by an IP address or other packet identifier. For example Core A can be dedicated to transactions between a particular client and a particular server therefore the load A on Core A may be comprised of the network traffic associated with the transactions between the particular client and server. Allocating the network traffic to Core A can be accomplished by routing all data packets originating from either the particular client or server to Core A.

While work or load can be distributed to the cores based in part on transactions in other embodiments load or work can be allocated on a per packet basis. In these embodiments the appliance can intercept data packets and allocate them to a core having the least amount of load. For example the appliance could allocate a first incoming data packet to Core A because the load A on Core is less than the load B N on the rest of the cores B N. Once the first data packet is allocated to Core A the amount of load A on Core A is increased proportional to the amount of processing resources needed to process the first data packet. When the appliance intercepts a second data packet the appliance will allocate the load to Core D because Core D has the second least amount of load. Allocating data packets to the core with the least amount of load can in some embodiments ensure that the load A N distributed to each core remains substantially equal.

In other embodiments load can be allocated on a per unit basis where a section of network traffic is allocated to a particular core . The above mentioned example illustrates load balancing on a per packet basis. In other embodiments load can be allocated based on a number of packets such that every 10 100 or 1000 packets are allocated to the core having the least amount of load. The number of packets allocated to a core can be a number determined by an application user or administrator and can be any number greater than zero. In still other embodiments load can be allocated based on a time metric such that packets are distributed to a particular core for a predetermined amount of time. In these embodiments packets can be distributed to a particular core for five milliseconds or for any period of time determined by a user program system administrator or otherwise. After the predetermined time period elapses data packets are transmitted to a different core for the predetermined period of time.

Flow based data parallelism methods for distributing work load or network traffic among the one or more cores can comprise any combination of the above mentioned embodiments. These methods can be carried out by any part of the appliance by an application or set of executable instructions executing on one of the cores such as the packet engine or by any application program or agent executing on a computing device in communication with the appliance .

The functional and data parallelism computing schemes illustrated in can be combined in any manner to generate a hybrid parallelism or distributed processing scheme that encompasses function parallelism data parallelism flow based data parallelism or any portions thereof. In some cases the multi core system may use any type and form of load balancing schemes to distribute load among the one or more cores . The load balancing scheme may be used in any combination with any of the functional and data parallelism schemes or combinations thereof.

The packet engine s A N can in some embodiments be associated with a particular server user client or network. When a packet engine becomes associated with a particular entity that packet engine can process data packets associated with that entity. For example should a packet engine be associated with a first user that packet engine will process and operate on packets generated by the first user or packets having a destination address associated with the first user. Similarly the packet engine may choose not to be associated with a particular entity such that the packet engine can process and otherwise operate on any data packets not generated by that entity or destined for that entity.

The flow distributors can comprise an interface mechanism that allows each flow distributor to communicate with the other flow distributors executing within the system . In one instance the one or more flow distributors can determine how to balance load by communicating with each other. This process can operate substantially similarly to the process described above for submitting votes to an arbiter which then determines which flow distributor should receive the load. In other embodiments a first flow distributor can identify the load on an associated core and determine whether to forward a first data packet to the associated core based on any of the following criteria the load on the associated core is above a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is below a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is less than the load on the other cores or any other metric that can be used to determine where to forward data packets based in part on the amount of load on a processor.

In some embodiments the RSS module uses the MICROSOFT receive side scaling RSS scheme. In one embodiment RSS is a Microsoft Scalable Networking initiative technology that enables receive processing to be balanced across multiple processors in the system while maintaining in order delivery of the data. The RSS may use any type and form of hashing scheme to determine a core or processor for processing a network packet.

The RSS module can apply any type and form hash function such as the Toeplitz hash function. The hash function may be applied to the hash type or any the sequence of values. The hash function may be a secure hash of any security level or is otherwise cryptographically secure. The hash function may use a hash key. The size of the key is dependent upon the hash function. For the Toeplitz hash the size may be 40 bytes for IPv6 and 16 bytes for IPv4.

The hash function may be designed and constructed based on any one or more criteria or design goals. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides an even distribution of hash result for different hash inputs and different hash types including TCP IPv4 TCP IPv6 IPv4 and IPv6 headers. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is evenly distributed when a small number of buckets are present for example two or four . In some embodiments hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is randomly distributed when a large number of buckets were present for example 64 buckets . In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on a level of computational or resource usage. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on ease or difficulty of implementing the hash in hardware. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on the ease or difficulty of a malicious remote host to send packets that would all hash to the same bucket.

The RSS may generate hashes from any type and form of input such as a sequence of values. This sequence of values can include any portion of the network packet such as any header field or payload of network packet or portions thereof. In some embodiments the input to the hash may be referred to as a hash type and include any tuples of information associated with a network packet or data flow such as any of the following a four tuple comprising at least two IP addresses and two ports a four tuple comprising any four sets of values a six tuple a two tuple and or any other sequence of numbers or values.

The network stack may set the actual number of bits to be used during initialization. The number will be between 1 and 7 inclusive.

The hash result may be used to identify the core or entity via any type and form of table such as a bucket table or indirection table. In some embodiments the number of hash result bits are used to index into the table. The range of the hash mask may effectively define the size of the indirection table. Any portion of the hash result or the hast result itself may be used to index the indirection table. The values in the table may identify any of the cores or processor such as by a core or processor identifier. In some embodiments all of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table. In other embodiments a port of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table. The indirection table may comprise any number of buckets for example 2 to 128 buckets that may be indexed by a hash mask.

The flow distributor in some embodiments executes within any module or program on the appliance on any one of the cores and on any one of the devices or components included within the multi core system . In some embodiments the flow distributor can execute on the first core A while in other embodiments the flow distributor can execute on the NIC . In still other embodiments an instance of the flow distributor can execute on each core included in the multi core system . In this embodiment each instance of the flow distributor can communicate with other instances of the flow distributor to forward packets back and forth across the cores . There exist situations where a response to a request packet may not be processed by the same core i.e. the first core processes the request while the second core processes the response. In these situations the instances of the flow distributor can intercept the packet and forward it to the desired or correct core i.e. a flow distributor instance can forward the response to the first core. Multiple instances of the flow distributor can execute on any number of cores and any combination of cores .

The flow distributor may operate responsive to any one or more rules or policies. The rules may identify a core or packet processing engine to receive a network packet data or data flow. The rules may identify any type and form of tuple information related to a network packet such as a 4 tuple of source and destination IP address and source and destination ports. Based on a received packet matching the tuple specified by the rule the flow distributor may forward the packet to a core or packet engine. In some embodiments the packet is forwarded to a core via shared memory and or core to core messaging.

Illustrated in is an embodiment of a multi core system comprising one or more processing cores A N. In brief overview one of the cores can be designated as a control core A and can be used as a control plane for the other cores . The other cores may be secondary cores which operate in a data plane while the control core provides the control plane. The cores A N may share a global cache . While the control core provides a control plane the other cores in the multi core system form or provide a data plane. These cores perform data processing functionality on network traffic while the control provides initialization configuration and control of the multi core system.

Further referring to and in more detail the cores A N as well as the control core A can be any processor described herein. Furthermore the cores A N and the control core A can be any processor able to function within the system described in . Still further the cores A N and the control core A can be any core or group of cores described herein. The control core may be a different type of core or processor than the other cores. In some embodiments the control may operate a different packet engine or have a packet engine configured differently than the packet engines of the other cores.

Any portion of the memory of each of the cores may be allocated to or used for a global cache that is shared by the cores. In brief overview a predetermined percentage or predetermined amount of each of the memory of each core may be used for the global cache. For example 50 of each memory of each code may be dedicated or allocated to the shared global cache. That is in the illustrated embodiment 2 GB of each core excluding the control plane core or core 1 may be used to form a 28 GB shared global cache. The configuration of the control plane such as via the configuration services may determine the amount of memory used for the shared global cache. In some embodiments each core may provide a different amount of memory for use by the global cache. In other embodiments any one core may not provide any memory or use the global cache. In some embodiments any of the cores may also have a local cache in memory not allocated to the global shared memory. Each of the cores may store any portion of network traffic to the global shared cache. Each of the cores may check the cache for any content to use in a request or response. Any of the cores may obtain content from the global shared cache to use in a data flow request or response.

The global cache can be any type and form of memory or storage element such as any memory or storage element described herein. In some embodiments the cores may have access to a predetermined amount of memory i.e. 32 GB or any other memory amount commensurate with the system . The global cache can be allocated from that predetermined amount of memory while the rest of the available memory can be allocated among the cores . In other embodiments each core can have a predetermined amount of memory. The global cache can comprise an amount of the memory allocated to each core . This memory amount can be measured in bytes or can be measured as a percentage of the memory allocated to each core . Thus the global cache can comprise 1 GB of memory from the memory associated with each core or can comprise 20 percent or one half of the memory associated with each core . In some embodiments only a portion of the cores provide memory to the global cache while in other embodiments the global cache can comprise memory not allocated to the cores .

Each core can use the global cache to store network traffic or cache data. In some embodiments the packet engines of the core use the global cache to cache and use data stored by the plurality of packet engines. For example the cache manager of and cache functionality of may use the global cache to share data for acceleration. For example each of the packet engines may store responses such as HTML data to the global cache. Any of the cache managers operating on a core may access the global cache to server caches responses to client requests.

In some embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store a port allocation table which can be used to determine data flow based in part on ports. In other embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store an address lookup table or any other table or list that can be used by the flow distributor to determine where to direct incoming and outgoing data packets. The cores can in some embodiments read from and write to cache while in other embodiments the cores can only read from or write to cache . The cores may use the global cache to perform core to core communications.

The global cache may be sectioned into individual memory sections where each section can be dedicated to a particular core . In one embodiment the control core A can receive a greater amount of available cache while the other cores can receiving varying amounts or access to the global cache .

In some embodiments the system can comprise a control core A. While illustrates core A as the control core the control core can be any core within the appliance or multi core system. Further while only a single control core is depicted the system can comprise one or more control cores each having a level of control over the system. In some embodiments one or more control cores can each control a particular aspect of the system . For example one core can control deciding which distribution scheme to use while another core can determine the size of the global cache .

The control plane of the multi core system may be the designation and configuration of a core as the dedicated management core or as a master core. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of operation and functionality the plurality of cores in the multi core system. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of allocation and use of memory of the system among the plurality of cores in the multi core system including initialization and configuration of the same. In some embodiments the control plane includes the flow distributor for controlling the assignment of data flows to cores and the distribution of network packets to cores based on data flows. In some embodiments the control plane core runs a packet engine and in other embodiments the control plane core is dedicated to management and control of the other cores of the system.

The control core A can exercise a level of control over the other cores such as determining how much memory should be allocated to each core or determining which core should be assigned to handle a particular function or hardware software entity. The control core A in some embodiments can exercise control over those cores within the control plan . Thus there can exist processors outside of the control plane which are not controlled by the control core A. Determining the boundaries of the control plane can include maintaining by the control core A or agent executing within the system a list of those cores controlled by the control core A. The control core A can control any of the following initialization of a core determining when a core is unavailable re distributing load to other cores when one core fails determining which distribution scheme to implement determining which core should receive network traffic determining how much cache should be allocated to each core determining whether to assign a particular function or element to a particular core determining whether to permit cores to communicate with one another determining the size of the global cache and any other determination of a function configuration or operation of the cores within the system .

The systems and methods of the present invention are directed towards techniques for handling link load balancing in a multi core device such as any of the multi core embodiments of appliance described herein. Load balancing refers to the distribution of network traffic across servers or services such as embodiments of appliance load balancing a plurality of client requests across a plurality of services or servers. Link Load Balancing or LLB is a term for load balancing routers that connect an enterprise to the Internet or other networks through multiple service providers such as Internet Service Providers ISP . For example an enterprise can have external connectivity to the Internet through a first ISP and another one through a second ISP and so on. The functionality of LLB is to load balance traffic between routers that connect an enterprise to these ISP links.

Link load balancing LLB is performed by embodiments of the appliance to balance forwarding of layer 3 or IP traffic to a next hop such as a router or ISP link e.g. Internet links . L3 forwarding involves route lookup based on the destination of the packet. If this route is an LLB route then the next hop may be decided based on a load balancing decision. In the case of persistency the load balancing decision should send a packet with the same destination or from the same flow as a previous packet to the same next hop. As network packets may be directed to different cores as described herein network packets to the same destination or to be persisted to the same next hop may be received at different cores in a multi core device. One core may receive a network packet although it is not the owner core of the persistence session.

To address the case of different cores receiving packets for the same session embodiments of the appliance sends core to core messages to coordinate LLB in this scenario. A receiving core may send a core to core message to the owner core to get the persistence information. The receiving core holds the received packet until the receiving core gets the reply from the core to core message to the owner core. A data structure such as a global array is used to hold the data structure storing the network packet referred to as a nsb. A hash of the four tuple of the network packet may be used as the index in the array. On receiving the reply of core to core message the receiving core does a lookup for the packet s data structure e.g. nsb in the global array using the four tuple index and forwards the packet to next hop identified by the persistence information.

Referring to . an embodiment of an environment for performing link load balancing by embodiments of the appliance is depicted. In brief overview an appliance may be deployed between or intermediary to a plurality of clients and or servers and one or more routers providing access to a corresponding Internet Service Provider ISP .

The appliance may be in communication via network s to a plurality of clients embodiments of which have been previously described herein. The appliance may also be in communication via network s to a plurality of servers embodiments of which have been previously described herein. The appliance may load balance the clients access to the servers.

The appliance may be in communication via network s to a plurality of routers A B. Each of the routers may provide links to an Internet Service Provider that provides the enterprise access or external connectivity to the Internet. Each router may correspond to a specific Internet Service Provider or link. The appliance may provide link load balancing of network traffic from any of the clients and or servers to the routers or links of each of the ISPs. The link load balancing may be done or based on any type and form of load balancing algorithm such as weighted round robin or least bandwidth or least number of packets.

Referring now to an embodiment of a multi core device in the form an appliance is depicted. In brief overview the appliance may comprise any number of cores a N and any number of packet engines A N as previously described herein. In some embodiments each core may execute a corresponding packet engine. The packet engine may be configured to execute or may other comprise one or more VIPs as previously described herein. The packet engine may include any of the embodiments previously described herein with any embodiments described in connection with . The packet engine may include a route engine route monitor persistence module link load balancer and ARP module .

In further details the route engine may comprise any type and form of executable instructions for routing network packets to the next hop such as to a router . In some embodiments the route engine may comprise a route VIP server for performing this routing. In some embodiments a route VIP may be configured or may execute to a corresponding router or ISP link. For example a route VIP may be configured to route and forward L3 traffic to one of the routers A N.

The packet engine or core may execute a route monitor which may include any type and form of executable instructions for monitoring the status of a link or a router. The route monitor may monitor a status of any next hops between the appliance and the Internet. The route monitor may use any type and form of request response mechanism to determine a status at any protocol layer. In some embodiments the route monitor uses an IP or network layer request response mechanism to determine status. In some embodiments the route monitors pings an IP address for the router or the link to determines the status from the response or lack thereof. The router monitor may also use any Address Resolution Protocol ARP to determine the status. The route monitor may monitor the router or link on any type of frequency or time period.

The persistence module may comprise any type and form of executable instructions executing on the appliance for establishing maintaining tracking and or managing persistency of network traffic or units thereof to a particular hop link or router. In some embodiments the persistence module establishes and maintains a persistence session for a flow of network traffic to a destination IP address. In some embodiments the persistence module establishes and maintains a persistence session for a flow of network traffic via a particular router hop or link. In some embodiments persistency is a configurable property or parameter of a packet engine or VIP executing on a packet engine.

The persistence module may store a destination IP session entry to have information on the router that was used as the gateway to reach the destination. In some embodiments an entry is created and populated with the router information upon sending the first packet. In some embodiments the entry is created upon the first IP packet going to that destination to this destination IP address. In some embodiments the first packet is the first data packet of an established connection or session to the destination. In some embodiments the first packet may be the SYN ACK or SYN ACK packet in a TCP handshake. In some embodiments this persistency or destination IP address entry may be aged out after a specified inactivity timeout period which may be settable through a command line or graphical user interface. In some embodiments the session persistence value is in minutes min value max value e.g. 2 1440 min. . A value of 0 may indicated that persistence is disabled. A default idle timeout may be for example 2 minutes. The minimum value may be restricted to a predetermined value such 2 minutes as we want to restrict the number of times the loop is traversed. Persistence ageing timeout may be stored in configuration or data structure of the packet engine or VIP. If a session is idle for a period defines by the idle timeout then the session entry may be deleted.

In some embodiments the LLB module invalidates session entries. In some embodiments if a router goes DOWN and if a session exists at that point of time pointing to the DOWN router then for the next packet of that session With destination IP based persistence it will be the next packet going to that same destination LLB will select another service router based on the LLB policy and update the session table accordingly to point to the newly selected router server.

All subsequent traffic after the first packet to this destination IP are then sent to the router that was used last time as the gateway. In some embodiments the persistence module provide information or hints to the LLB module about a preferred server. However the LLB module can override the decision based on other factors. Session entry may then be updated with the load balancing module s decision about the final selected router.

Persistency in the LLB scenario or in environments such as those depicted in may be desirable. In some embodiments without persistency simple round robin can result in retransmissions or out of order packets etc based on the network dynamics transitions which are on other side of the routers. For example if one ISP router side is fast and the other is slow then the appliance round robin selection of routers may send one packet to one router and other to the second router. This can result in above said behavior. Destination IP based persistence tries to reduce that by sending traffic from a flow via the same router.

The link load balancing module or link load balancer LLB may comprise any type and form of executable instructions executing on the device of the appliance. The LLB may perform any type and form of load balancing algorithm. The LLB may load balance any layer 1 2 or 3 network traffic. The LLB may load balance any network traffic received by the appliance and being forwarded to any one of a next hop router or link. The LLB may load balance any network traffic destined to the Internet via external connectivity. The LLB may load balance responsive to the persistence module. The LLB may load balance responsive to the route engine. The LLB may load balance responsive to the route monitor.

The ARP module may comprise any type and form of executable instructions executing on the device of the appliance. The ARP module may implement handle and or process any type and form of Address Resolution Protocol functionality support and capabilities in accordance with the ARP standard or any derivatives or alternates thereof. The ARP module may interface or communicate with any of the routing engine routing monitoring or any other module or functionality of the packet engine.

In operation the appliance decides the source IP and source port of the connection based on the LLB route next hop. This may occur in conjunction or association with the appliance s allocation of a server side process control block network address translation process control block for the connection and an appliance data structure referred to as an nsb for the packet. If persistency is enabled for LLB a first core may receive a packet for a session established or persisted by a second core. The second core may be considered the owner core of session or the persistence information for the session. The first core may send a request for the persistence information to the second core via any type and form of interface such as core to core messaging or a shared memory interface. In some embodiments the first core sends a core to core message requesting the persistence information stored or established by the owner core e.g. second core . The owner core may respond to the request with the stored persistence information.

In some embodiments at the time of source IP and source port selection if a request to the owner core for persistence information is sent or needs to be sent the packet engine may allocate a port on a dummy IP address. The dummy IP address may be any IP address designed for such purposes or an address selected from a predetermined range of IP addresses. In some embodiments the dummy IP address may be an address currently not in use by the appliance. The Connection pcb natpcb and nsb data structures are created with dummy IP as the source IP and port on dummy IP as the source port. This nsb will processed via normal routing by the appliance as an LLB decision ha not yet taken.

On receiving a response to the request for the persistence information the appliance such as via packet engine selects a source IP and source port based on the persistence information. The packet engine may free the port from the dummy IP. The packet engine may modify the pcb natpcb and nsb data structures to use the selected source IP and source port from the persistent information. The pcb natpcb is rehashed into the appropriate hash buckets. The received core may cache the LLB route information in or with the pcb natpcb data structure s . The appliance packet engine may transmit out the packet represented by the nsb out on the connection represented by the pcb natpcb.

In some embodiments a LLB decision is applied every time appliances routes a packet via a LLB route. Input to load balancing module may be a VIP which is associated to the LLB route. In some embodiments the VIP is associated with a preferred IP and preferred port if persistence is enabled. If the preferred router state is UP module updates the server statistics and returns the server structure for the selected router in this case preferred server . If no preferred server is passed or the preferred server is not available LLB looks through the server list for the passed VIP to determine the ideal router as per the policy.

In some embodiments the LLB uses a round robin based load balancing algorithm In some embodiments the LLB uses a weighted a round robin based load balancing algorithm. In some embodiments the LLB may use a least packets based load balancing algorithm. For example the appliance may track the number of packets forwarded by the appliance to a specific router. In some embodiments the LLB may use a least bandwidth based load balancing algorithm. For example the appliance may track the number of bytes sent and or received between the appliance and a specific router. In some embodiments the LLB may use a destination IP address based load balancing algorithm. For example the LLB may hash the destination IP address of the packet to select a route or router to forward the packet.

In some embodiments if there are no persistence settings then the LLB may perform per packet LLB. For each packet LLB will choose one router based on the selected LB method. If persistence is set then if a packet needs to be routed by application via a LLB route that doesn t have a session established then LLB chooses a router and creates a session. Subsequent packets for that session will use that session s parameters. If a service router goes down then LLB will take care of updating the session parameters accordingly. e.g. either by choosing some other router or by deleting the session itself if inactivity timer expires. 

Referring now to an example deployment and configuration of the appliance for providing LLB services is depicted. In brief overview appliance is deployed to provides access of servers on a private network 192.169.1.X to a second network 10.102.1.X such as a public network with connectivity to the Internet via routers R1 and R2 for corresponding Internet service providers. further shows text for an example configuration of the appliance in such a deployment.

In further details of the configuration a route VIP may be configured for a packet engine using a form of command such as

Referring to embodiments of steps of a method for link load balancing by a multi core device is depicted. In brief overview at step the multi core device provides link load balancing among a plurality of links to the Internet. The multi core device may provide persistency of network traffic to a selected link based on a persistency type. At step the multi core device may receive a packet to be link load balanced. The packet may be received on any core such as one referred to generally as a first core. At step the core receiving the packet identifies that it is not the owner of the persistence information for the packet or session of the packet and identifies another core generally referred to as the second core as the owner core. At step the first core sends a request to the second core for persistence information and received a response comprising the persistence information. At step the first core selects the Internet link or LLB route based on the persistence information.

In further details of step any embodiments of the appliance described herein may be deployed a device intermediary to a plurality of routers or other network devices providing external network connections such as to the Internet and a plurality of computing devices such as clients and or servers. The appliance may comprise a multi core device with a plurality of packet engines and or virtual servers operating on one or more of the cores. The packet engines and or virtual servers may operate in any virtualized environments describe herein for example such as those embodiments described in connection with . In some embodiments each core of the multi core device may operate a load balancing virtual server or lb vServer. The LB vServer may be configured to perform load balancing of network traffic across the plurality of network devices e.g. routers providing access to external network such as the Internet or to Internet Service Providers ISPs . Any LB vserver may perform link load balancing based on any selected or configured load balancing method and or persistence type.

The Link Load Balancing LLB feature appliance may used to transparently load balance outbound network traffic across multiple Internet connections. Response traffic may honor the existing flow. For example if you have multiple ISP links to the Internet as shown in or B then the LLB feature enables load balance between the routers to select the best link for the traffic in question based on the configuration. In some cases Reverse Network Address Translation NAT is also configured to ensure the appropriate ingress and egress points are used and traffic flows are preserved. RNAT is comparable to a static or dynamic NAT found on other network devices for outbound client connections to the internet in the case of LLB.

The vServers of the appliance may be configured to perform any of the following load balancing method. RoundRobin DestinationHash LeastBandwidth and LeastPackets. In embodiments of a RoundRobin method of load balancing the appliance rotates the outgoing packets among the available links. This method distributes packets equally among the links even if they operate at different speeds. In embodiments of a DestinationHash method of load balancing the appliance use the hashed value of the destination IP address to select a link. One can mask the destination IP address to specify which part of it to use in the hash value calculation so that requests that are from different networks but destined for the same subnet are all directed to the same link. In embodiments of a LeastBandwidth method of load balancing the appliance selects the link that is currently serving the least amount of traffic which may be measured in megabits per second Mbps . In embodiments of a LeastBandwidth method of load balancing the appliance selects the link that has received the fewest packets in a predetermined time period such as the last 14 seconds.

The LLB of the appliance may be designed and constructed to provide persistency based on a persistency type. The available persistence types may include source IP address based destination IP address based and source IP and destination IP address based. With destination IP address based persistence when the appliance receives a request from a new client it creates a persistence session based on the IP address of the service e.g. router or link selected by the virtual server the destination IP address . Subsequently the appliance directs requests to the same destination IP to the same service e.g. router or link . For persistence based on the source IP address of inbound packets. After the load balancing method selects a link for transmission of the first packet the appliance directs all subsequent packets sent from the same source IP address to the same link. For persistence based on the source IP address of inbound packets and destination IP address of outbound packets. After the load balancing method selects a link for transmission of the first packet the appliance directs all subsequent requests from the same source IP address and to the same destination IP address to the same link.

At step the multi core device may receive a packet for transmission via a link to the external network connection or otherwise for link load balancing. Any core may receive the packet out of the multiple cores on the device. The packet may be forwarded to a core by the flow distributor or RSS components of the device described elsewhere herein. The packet may be a subsequent packet of a flow of packets from a device such as a client or server. A first or previous packet from the device may have been received or processed on a core different than the packet received at step . For example the packet received at step may be received on a first core that is different from the core such as a second core that received a first or previous packet from the device.

At step the core receiving the packet generally referred to as the first core may identify that the first core is not the core that owns the persistence session for the packet. The first core may determine that another core such is what is generally referred to as a second core owns or otherwise established and or maintains the persistence session. The first core may determine that the first core is not the owner core by failing to find persistence information stored in cache or memory of the first core. Cores may store persistence information such as via a persistence module using a hash based on tuple information of a packet such as any combination or source IP destination IP source Port and destination Port. The receiving core may determine the core id of the owner core by taking a hash of tuple information of the packet. If the hash value falls into a range of values assigned to a particular core then that core is the owner core. The first core receiving core may determine the core id of the owner core by decoding a core identifier in a session id of the packet. The receiving core may determine the core id of the owner core by identifying a core identifier in a cookie provided via or in association with the packet. The receiving core may determine the owner core from a persistence table maintained by the persistence module. The receiving core may determine the owner core from a session entry maintained by the persistence module.

At step the receiving core may send a request to the core maintaining the persistence information for the connection of the packet the flow of the packet the client of the packet or otherwise for the packet. The request may comprise a request for a copy of the persistence information. The request may comprise a request for identification of the link previously selected for this connection flow or client. The request may comprise a request for LLB route information to be used for this packet. The request may include any tuple information of the received packet.

The receiving core may use any type and form of core to core interface or communications such as a core to core messaging. Cores may communicate with other cores via a synchronous or asynchronous messaging. Cores may communicate with other cores via a shared memory interface.

The owner core receiving the request may identify the persistence information based on the request such as via tuple information identified via the request. The owner core such as via persistence module may use a hash of the tuple information to look up the persistence information stored by the owner core. The persistence information may include information on a persistence session. The persistence session may identify the connection or tuple information for the persistent connection or the connection to be persisted. The persistence information may include the persistence type used and any information identifying the previously selected service or route. The owner core may response with a copy of the persistence information or a portion of the persistence information. The owner core may identify or determine the previously selected LLB router route or link. The identification may be based on service name router name route addressing information or IP address and port information for the selected link.

At step the first core receives from the owner core the requested persistence information. While waiting for the owner core to respond the receiving core such as via an LLB configured vServer may hold or buffer the packet until a determination of the LLB route is made. From the received persistence information the first core identifies the previously selected or used LLB route for the packet. In some embodiments the received persistence information identifies the persistence type and an LLB vServer of the first core applies the persistence type e.g. source IP destination IP or source and destination IP to the received pack to identify the LLB route for the packet. The vServer of the first core forwards the packet to the LLB route based on the persistence type. In some embodiments the received persistence information identifies the route information and an LLB vServer of the first core forwards the packet to the identified LLB route. In some embodiments the received persistence information identifies the name of the service link or router and an LLB vServer of the first core forwards the packet based on this identification.

The first core may store the received persistence session information to cache or memory for lookup for subsequently received packets In this manner the first core may avoid a core to core message to the owner core to make an LLB route decision. In some embodiments the first core stores the persistence information in or via the persistence module.

Referring now to another embodiment of steps of a method for link load balancing by a multi core device is depicted. In brief overview at step the multi core device provides link load balancing among a plurality of links to the Internet. The multi core device may provide persistency of network traffic to a selected link based on a persistency type. At step the multi core device may receive a packet to be link load balanced. The packet may be received on any core such as one referred to generally as a first core. At step the core receiving the packet identifies that it is not the owner of the persistence information for the packet or session of the packet and identifies another core generally referred to as the second core as the owner core. At step the first core sends a request to the second core for persistence information and receives a response comprising the persistence information. At step the first core selects a source IP address and source port based on the persistence information. At step the first core forwards the packet to the LLB route for the selected source IP address and source port.

At step the multi core device may perform link load balancing via any of the embodiments described above in connection with step of . A plurality of load balancing vServers may each operate on a corresponding core of the plurality of cores of a multi core device such as a multi core appliance. Each of the vServers may configured to perform persistence based load balancing based on any one of the persistence types.

At step the multi core device may receive a packet to be link load balanced. Any core of the receiving core may receive the packet. The receiving core referred to as the first core may be different than a core referred to as the second core or owner core that established a persistence session for the flow connection or originating device such as a client or server. A previous packet from the originating device may have been forwarded to a core other than the first core. The first core may not have the persistence session stored in memory or cache.

Upon receiving the packet the multi core may establish data structure s for the packet and or packet s connection referred to sometimes as an NSB or PCB or NSB PCB. As the first core does not yet have the persistence information to yet make the LLB decision the first core such as a vServer of the first core may use a dummy source port and dummy source IP address for setting up the connection data structure. The dummy source IP address and dummy source port can be any IP address and port number that is not intended to be used in the actual connection. In some embodiments the dummy source IP address and dummy source port are not available IP address and port. In some embodiments the dummy source IP address and dummy source port are an IP address and port not currently used. In some embodiments the dummy source IP address and dummy source port are any random IP address and port. In some embodiments the dummy source IP address and dummy source port are any non sensical IP address and port. The data structure may be hashed to place or store into a bucket such as a hash bucket used by the vServer for load balancing. A bucket may comprise a data structure object or allocated memory area for storing or identifying data structures to be forwarded by the device in accordance with the configured load balancing method.

At step the first core may identify that persistence is enabled and that a second core is the owner core of the persistence session. A vServer of the first core receiving the packet may identify via its configuration that persistence is enabled and that a predetermined persistence type has been identified. Step may include any embodiments of step described above. The vServer of the first core may use a hash of any portion of the tuple information to identify the core that owns the persistence information. The vServer of the first core may decode a core identifier from any session id of the packet. The vServer of the first core may identify a core from a cookie of or related to the packet.

At step the receiving core may request and receive a response from the owner core for persistence information. Step may include any of the embodiments of step described above. The received persistence information may include a copy of data representative of the persistence session. The received persistence information may include information identifying the LLB route selected for this connection flow or device. The received persistence information may include tuple information identifying the LLB route. The first core may store the persistence information in the persistence module or cache for lookup on subsequent packets from the same flow or same persistence type.

In some embodiments the communications between cores is asynchronous. The first core may hold the outgoing data structure referred to as an nsb until a reply is received from core to core message. A global array accessible by the cores may be used to hold the nsb using hash of four tuple as the index in the array. On receiving the reply of core to core message the receiving core can lookup the nsb based on hash of four tuple and the device can forward the nsb e.g. packet .

At step the first core such as a vServer of the first core selects a source IP address and source port based on the persistence information. The source IP address and source port may be selected to correspond to the selected LLB route. The source IP address and source port may be selected to correspond to the persistence type. The source IP address and source port may be selected from the available IP addresses and ports hosted by the appliance that are routable via the LLB route selected by the persistence information. The first core may modify the established data structure for the packet and or connection to use or identify the selected source IP address and selected source port. The modified data structure may be rehashed to place or store into an appropriate bucket used by the vServer for load balancing based on the load balancing method.

At step the first core such as via the vServer forwards the packets to the LLB route for the selected source IP address and source port. The vServer may forward the packet to same route or link previously selected for this flow based on the source IP destination IP and or source and destination IP. The vServer may pick up the data structure NSB in the appropriate bucket and forward the packet.
