A board management change alert may be generated when a change at a company of interest results in a change in its control group e.g. board of directors managers etc. . The companies of interest may be client companies competitors of client companies market leaders etc. In various embodiments the companies of interest may be predetermined and or selected by a user.

News alerts may be generated when a new news story is received for example the news stories that populate field described above. In various embodiments when new news stories are received they are aggregated and de duplicated. For example more than one news story covering the same news event or development may be received. News alerts may be configured so that only one news alert is generated per news event or development. A representative news story may then be presented to a user as a link. In various embodiments multiple representative news stories may be presented allowing the user to choose a story to view.

The system may also include one or more servers . Servers may execute applications implementing the systems and methods described herein. For example server may serve the user interface described above to one or more user systems . The servers may also provide other user interfaces to users displaying information related to a communication for example those described herein below. In various embodiments the servers may monitor data and generate alerts where appropriate maintain and query databases populate interfaces etc.

Databases may store various information served to the user according to various embodiments. The information may be generated in house or in various embodiments may be provided by an outside vendor . Also in various embodiments all or a portion of one or more of the databases may be external to a firm implementing the system and may be accessed via network . It will be appreciated that any of the databases may be implemented as one unitary database or as any number of separate individual databases.

Each of the databases may include information provided to the user through interfaces . For example Research Database may include various research reports on potential subject companies that may be displayed to the user for example by module and or monitored and presented in various alerts. News Database may include various news stories regarding potential subject companies that may be displayed to the user for example by module and or monitored and presented in various alerts. Financial Database may include various financial data regarding potential subject companies that may be displayed to the user for example by modules etc. and or monitored and presented in various alerts. A Customer Relationship Management CRM database may include contact information for various potential subject individuals as well as information regarding recent and future scheduled contacts with the individuals for example shown to the user through module and or monitored and presented in various alerts. The various databases may be populated by information internal to a firm or by one or more outside vendors .

In various embodiments the system may also include components for handling communication events. For example communications to or from a computer or other network enabled component of the user systems may be transported via the network . One or more of the servers may intercept incoming network communications and take appropriate action e.g. direct the communication to the appropriate user system generate alerts etc. . Also in various embodiments the system may interface with a public switch telephone network PSTN through a private branch exchange PBX . In this way the system may be able to view and or manipulate incoming telephone calls. The PSTN may be connected to the PBX via one or more trunk lines represented by line . The PBX may route incoming calls received from the PSTN to the appropriate user subsystem for example a telephone at the appropriate user subsystem . The PBX may be any kind of suitable PBX for example any PBX available from AVAYA. A computer telephone interface CTI may connect the PBX to the network . This may allow other components on the network including for example the server and computers to manipulate incoming and outgoing calls and take suitable actions. For example a user may be able to pick up a call transfer a call dial a call etc. based on inputs to his or her computer . The CTI may include any suitable combination of hardware and software.

In various embodiments the system may also be used to handle communications with or from the user for example as described below. Example communications may include telephone calls e mails instant messages etc. It will be appreciated that the communication handling may be implemented in addition to or in conjunction with the various interfaces and alerts described above.

At step the communication event may be detected and captured. Various components of the system e.g. servers user systems etc. may be configured to use various methods to detect communication events. For example when a communication event is triggered by an e mail various application programming interfaces APIs of a particular e mail application associated with the e mail may detect and notify appropriate programs about communication events arising from operation of the e mail application. When an e mail arrives in a MICROSOFT OUTLOOK e mail application the communication event can notify appropriate system components through the use of APIs associated with the e mail application that a change representing a communication event e.g. arrival of an e mail has just occurred. When the communication event is a telephone call the telephone call may be detected through the switch and CTI . For example when a telephone call is received the switch may be configured to recognize the incoming telephone call as a communication event. As part of the detection and capture process at step the CTI may notify the appropriate server that the telephone is ringing and communicate caller identification data for example to one or more components of the user system associated with the called party.

At step the system may use the communication event data captured at step to perform one or more additional functions in accordance with the communication event data. For example the system may use the communication event data to query various system components such as databases to retrieve information associated with the communication event data. For example if the communication event data includes a caller identification for a telephone number then the system may search the CRM database for a client name associated with the caller identification information. Also in various embodiments the system may populate an interface such as interface with information relating to the communication. For example the interface may be generated or re generated with the other party to the communication as the subject individual and the other party s company as the subject company.

At step the system may present the results of the function performed in step for example by presenting a consolidated portal like screen display of information collected during a search performed in the CRM database . In various embodiments the display may be a version of the user interface described above or one of various other user interfaces for example as described herein. In various embodiments the information provided at step may be presented in the form of a pop up window that automatically disappears after a few seconds for example or in the form of a side bar window that appears on a screen display of the currently active application employed by the user.

In various embodiments the presentation of the results at step may be personalized for the particular user viewing the information and or may be customizable by the user perhaps based on the channel of communication in which the communication event was generated. For example with respect to an instant message communication event the user may want to view a smaller subset of client information in comparison to a larger subset of information for a client telephone call because the user may not have convenient access to use a computer system during a telephone call. Also the presentation of results can be driven by the particular working style preferences of the user. It can be appreciated therefore that the appearance of information push functions employed by the system in presenting results at step may be configurable by the user. In addition the user may configure how the information push is invoked for a given communication event. For instance it may be a distraction for certain users to receive pop up windows for all telephone calls when most of their work is performed with e mail and not by using the telephone. Also the user may want to temporarily suspend display of results for certain communication channels.

It can be seen that various embodiments can provide a targeted push of relevant information to an end user when certain communication events occur. The information displayed may include data drawn from one or more of the databases etc. The content and or format of information displayed to the end user may depend on one or more factors including but not limited to for example who is in the conversation internal party and external party whether the external party is a known contact within the CRM database the kind of communication event e.g. incoming phone call versus calendar reminder popup the user s role and location e.g. sales traders at an investment bank may care about a different set of data than bankers or different sets of regulations may apply to user in different roles and job functions and or the user s previous reaction to information contained in the information push e.g. a mechanism or user interface can be provided by the system in the information push that allows the user to change or customize the display of a subsequent information push .

In various embodiments the system may be configured to automatically execute one or more searches or initiate retrieval of information upon occurrence of specific communication events or combinations of communication events. The system may identify and collect characteristics about the party communicating with the firm e.g. a telephone number in the event of a phone call an instant messaging address in the event of an instant messaging conversation a H323 SIP DID address in the event of a video conferencing call or an e mail address in the event of a calendar reminder . These characteristics may serve as inputs to the automated searches or information retrieval processes that can be performed at step . The searches may uncover for example upcoming meetings with the party a history of recent e mails exchanged by the user with the party and or a history of e mails sent by the party to which the user has not yet replied etc.

In various embodiments the system may use local desktop search tools as a way to distribute the burden of automated information retrieval. This allows efficient use of the computing resources of the system because searches can be executed locally as opposed to having multiple desktop computer systems querying a central information service every time a communication event is received. For example each user system may include or have access to all or a portion of the information present at databases . Accordingly each user system may be able to individual perform a query when a communication event directed to that subsystem is received. Also embodiments of the system may make beneficial use of communication event data to perform programmatic invocation of search technology including desktop search technology as a way to retrieve and present relevant customer information to users.

In various embodiments the window may also include buttons for controlling the call. For example selecting a button may allow the user to transfer the call to another extension. Selecting button may allow the user to add other users to the call to form a conference call. Selecting button may allow the user to drop the call. Selecting button may allow the user to transfer the call to voicemail. Also button may allow the user to prepare and send an e mail to the caller. For example selecting button may link the user to an e mail program including for example MICROSOFT OUTLOOK a web based e mail account etc.

Referring back to at block the user may perform additional operations. For example referring to the user may change the selected caller by activating field . It may be desirable to change the selected caller in situations where the listed caller is not the person to whom the user is speaking. This may occur if the caller was misidentified or is calling from a different line than usual. The user may also e mail the caller by selecting box . In window shown in the cursor is shown over an Actions field displaying an additional field that provides the user with information and a list of other available actions. For example field displays information regarding the user. Selecting field may send an e mail to the user. Selecting field may allow the user to select an instant message. The instant message may be prepared and sent according to any known program or protocol including for example MICROSOFT MESSENGER AOL INSTANT MESSENGER YAHOO MESSENGER etc. Field may allow the user to add or coordinate contact information about the caller with a computerized address book. For example the user may add the caller to the address book update an existing entry for the caller in the address book create a rule regarding contacts with the caller etc. The computerized address book may be any kind of address book implemented on a computer including for example the MS OUTLOOK product available from MICROSOFT.

A field shown in field may provide the user with still more additional actions and information. Selecting field may display field including various sub fields. For example the user may dial an additional phone number by selecting one of sub fields . This may allow the user to conference the new number into the existing phone call. Referring back to the user may terminate the call at step . The call may be terminated in any way. For example the user may transfer the call to voicemail place the call on hold conference the call with another individual and or hang up.

For the process flow it is assumed that the caller s identity is predetermined. Various embodiments of the invention however may identify the caller for example automatically or based on input from the user. shows a process flow illustrating a process for identifying a caller according to various embodiments. At step an incoming call may be received. At decision block it may be determined whether caller ID is available for the call. If caller ID is not available the user may be prompted to identify the call at box for example based on the caller s voice or verbal self identification.

Referring back to if caller ID is available it may be determined whether the caller is an internal caller at decision block . For example a caller who is also an employee of the firm may be an internal caller. If the caller is an internal caller the process flow may proceed to an internal call procedure at step . The internal call procedure may be determined by the firm. For example the firm may implement an internal call procedure similar to the identified caller process flow shown in . In various embodiments the firm may not track internal calls at all. In one non limiting embodiment the firm may track some aspects of internal calls but not to the extent of process flow .

If it is determined at decision block that the caller is not internal the identity of the caller may be sought at decision block . For example the caller s telephone number may be cross referenced with a list of potential callers and telephone numbers included in a CRM database . In one non limiting embodiment the list of potential callers may be screened according to entries in the user s computerized address book. If one match for the caller s number is found at block then the process flow may proceed to the identified caller process flow at block . If no match or multiple matches for the caller s number are found at block then user may be prompted to identify the caller s identity at block .

When no matches are found the user may be shown window of and invited to activate field to select the caller from a list of potential callers for example included in the CRM database . In various embodiments the list of potential callers included in field may be screened and or organized based on the user s computerized address book. It will be appreciated that the caller may be unidentified yet present in the database for example if the caller is not calling from his or her normal telephone e.g. a hotel phone a different extension etc. If multiple matches are found between the caller s number and entries in the CRM database then the user may be shown window of . There may be multiple matches for example if the caller s company broadcasts only one or a few trunk numbers on caller ID without displaying specific extensions. The user may select the correct caller from the list shown in field . The callers listed in field may in one non limiting embodiment be screened and or organized based on the user s computerized address book. When the correct caller identity is selected it may be recorded to the database at step . The process flow may then proceed to the identified caller process flow at step .

Various embodiments of the present invention may provide support for the user s administrative assistant. For example when the user receives a call his or her administrative assistant may be able to view the identity of the caller and some information regarding the caller and the caller s company. The administrative assistant may also be able to message the user during a call. Also if the user is away from his or her desk the administrative assistant may be able to answer the call and prepare a message to the user including information about the caller etc.

At event an incoming call is received.
