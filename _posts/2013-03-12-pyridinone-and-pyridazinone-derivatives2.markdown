Bromodomains refer to conserved protein structural folds which bind to N acetylated lysine residues that are found in some proteins. The BET family of bromodomain containing proteins is comprised of four members BRD2 BRD3 BRD4 and BRDt . Each member of the BET family employs two bromodomains to recognize N acetylated lysine residues found primarily but not exclusively on the amino terminal tails of histone proteins. These interactions modulate gene expression by recruiting transcription factors to specific genome locations within chromatin. For example histone bound BRD4 recruits the transcription factor P TEFb to promoters resulting in the expression of a subset of genes involved in cell cycle progression Yang et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 28 967 976 2008 . BRD2 and BRD3 also function as transcriptional regulators of growth promoting genes LeRoy et al. Mol. Cell 30 51 60 2008 . BET family members were recently established as being important for the maintenance of several cancer types Zuber et al. Nature 478 524 528 2011 Mertz et al Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci. 108 16669 16674 2011 Delmore et al. Cell 146 1 14 2011 Dawson et al. Nature 478 529 533 2011 . BET family members have also been implicated in mediating acute inflammatory responses through the canonical NF KB pathway Huang et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 29 1375 1387 2009 resulting in the upregulation of genes associated with the production of cytokines Nicodeme et al. Nature 468 1119 1123 2010 . Suppression of cytokine induction by BET bromodomain inhibitors has been shown to be an effective approach to treat inflammation mediated kidney disease in an animal model Zhang et al. J. Biol. Chem. 287 28840 28851 2012 . BRD2 function has been linked to predisposition for dyslipidemia or improper regulation of adipogenesis elevated inflammatory profiles and increased susceptibility to autoimmune diseases Denis Discovery Medicine 10 489 499 2010 . The human immunodeficiency virus utilizes BRD4 to initiate transcription of viral RNA from stably integrated viral DNA Jang et al. Mol. Cell 19 523 534 2005 . BET bromodomain inhibitors have also been shown to reactivate HIV transcription in models of latent T cell infection and latent monocyte infection Banerjee et al J. Leukocyte Biol. doi 10.1189 jlb.0312165 . BRDt has an important role in spermatogenesis that is blocked by BET bromodomain inhibitors Matzuk et al. Cell 150 673 684 2012 . Accordingly there is an ongoing medical need to develop new drugs to treat these indications.

If a moiety is described as being optionally substituted with up to a particular number of non hydrogen radicals that moiety may be either 1 not substituted or 2 substituted by up to that particular number of non hydrogen radicals or by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the moiety whichever is less. Thus for example if a moiety is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non hydrogen radicals then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non hydrogen radicals as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. To illustrate tetrazolyl which has only one substitutable position would be optionally substituted with up to one non hydrogen radical. To illustrate further if an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non hydrogen radicals then a primary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non hydrogen radicals whereas a secondary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to only 1 non hydrogen radical.

In another embodiment the isotope labeled compounds contain deuterium H tritium H or C isotopes. Isotope labeled compounds of this invention can be prepared by the general methods well known to persons having ordinary skill in the art. Such isotope labeled compounds can be conveniently prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Examples disclosed herein and Schemes by substituting a readily available isotope labeled reagent for a non labeled reagent. In some instances compounds may be treated with isotope labeled reagents to exchange a normal atom with its isotope for example hydrogen for deuterium can be exchanged by the action of a deuteric acid such as DSO DO. In addition to the above relevant procedures and intermediates are disclosed for instance in Lizondo J et al. 21 11 1116 1996 Brickner S J et al. 39 3 673 1996 Mallesham B et al. 5 7 963 2003 PCT publications WO1997010223 WO2005099353 WO1995007271 WO2006008754 U.S. Pat.

The isotope labeled compounds of the invention may be used as standards to determine the effectiveness of BET bromodomain inhibitors in binding assays. Isotope containing compounds have been used in pharmaceutical research to investigate the in vivo metabolic fate of the compounds by evaluation of the mechanism of action and metabolic pathway of the nonisotope labeled parent compound Blake et al. 64 3 367 391 1975 . Such metabolic studies are important in the design of safe effective therapeutic drugs either because the in vivo active compound administered to the patient or because the metabolites produced from the parent compound prove to be toxic or carcinogenic Foster et al. Advances in Drug Research Vol. 14 pp. 2 36 Academic press London 1985 Kato et al. 36 10 927 932 1995 Kushner et al. 77 79 88 1999 .

In addition non radio active isotope containing drugs such as deuterated drugs called heavy drugs can be used for the treatment of diseases and conditions related to BET bromodomain activity. Increasing the amount of an isotope present in a compound above its natural abundance is called enrichment. Examples of the amount of enrichment include from about 0.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 16 21 25 29 33 37 42 46 50 54 58 63 67 71 75 79 84 88 92 96 to about 100 mol . Replacement of up to about 15 of normal atom with a heavy isotope has been effected and maintained for a period of days to weeks in mammals including rodents and dogs with minimal observed adverse effects Czajka D M and Finkel A J Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1960 84 770 Thomson J F Ann. New York Acad. Sci. 1960 84 736 Czakja D M et al. Am. J. Physiol. 1961 201 357 . Acute replacement of as high as 15 23 in human fluids with deuterium was found not to cause toxicity Blagojevic N et al. in Dosimetry Treatment Planning for Neutron Capture Therapy Zamenhof R Solares G and Harling O Eds. 1994. Advanced Medical Publishing Madison Wis. pp. 125 134 Diabetes Metab. 23 251 1997 .

Stable isotope labeling of a drug can alter its physico chemical properties such as pKa and lipid solubility. These effects and alterations can affect the pharmacodynamic response of the drug molecule if the isotopic substitution affects a region involved in a ligand receptor interaction. While some of the physical properties of a stable isotope labeled molecule are different from those of the unlabeled one the chemical and biological properties are the same with one important exception because of the increased mass of the heavy isotope any bond involving the heavy isotope and another atom will be stronger than the same bond between the light isotope and that atom. Accordingly the incorporation of an isotope at a site of metabolism or enzymatic transformation will slow said reactions potentially altering the pharmacokinetic profile or efficacy relative to the non isotopic compound.

Compounds described herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms including hydrated forms such as hemi hydrates. In general the solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water and ethanol among others are equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the invention.

This invention also provides for pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier diluent or excipient therefor. The phrase pharmaceutical composition refers to a composition suitable for administration in medical or veterinary use.

The pharmaceutical compositions that comprise a compound of formula I alone or or in combination with a second active pharmaceutical agent may be administered to the subjects orally rectally parenterally intracisternally intravaginally intraperitoneally topically as by powders ointments or drops bucally or as an oral or nasal spray. The term parenterally as used herein refers to modes of administration which include intravenous intramuscular intraperitoneal intrasternal subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion.

The term pharmaceutically acceptable carrier as used herein means a non toxic inert solid semi solid or liquid filler diluent encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as but not limited to lactose glucose and sucrose starches such as but not limited to corn starch and potato starch cellulose and its derivatives such as but not limited to sodium carboxymethyl cellulose ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate powdered tragacanth malt gelatin talc excipients such as but not limited to cocoa butter and suppository waxes oils such as but not limited to peanut oil cottonseed oil safflower oil sesame oil olive oil corn oil and soybean oil glycols such a propylene glycol esters such as but not limited to ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate agar buffering agents such as but not limited to magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide alginic acid pyrogen free water isotonic saline Ringer s solution ethyl alcohol and phosphate buffer solutions as well as other non toxic compatible lubricants such as but not limited to sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate as well as coloring agents releasing agents coating agents sweetening flavoring and perfuming agents preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition according to the judgment of the formulator.

Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral injection comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions dispersions suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers diluents solvents or vehicles include water ethanol polyols such as glycerol propylene glycol polyethylene glycol and the like vegetable oils such as olive oil injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate and suitable mixtures thereof. Proper fluidity can be maintained for example by the use of coating materials such as lecithin by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants.

These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives wetting agents emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents for example paraben chlorobutanol phenol sorbic acid and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.

In some cases in order to prolong the effect of the drug it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which in turn may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form may be accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.

Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly orthoesters and poly anhydrides . Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.

The injectable formulations can be sterilized for example by filtration through a bacterial retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium just prior to use.

In the case of capsules tablets and pills the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.

The pharmaceutical composition may be a unit dosage form. In such form the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation the package containing discrete quantities of preparation such as packeted tablets capsules and powders in vials or ampules. Also the unit dosage form can be a capsule tablet cachet or lozenge itself or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form. The quantity of active component in a unit dose preparation may be varied or adjusted from 0.1 mg to 1000 mg from 1 mg to 100 mg or from 1 to 95 w w of a unit dose according to the particular application and the potency of the active component. The composition can if desired also contain other compatible therapeutic agents.

The dose to be administered to a subject may be determined by the efficacy of the particular compound employed and the condition of the subject as well as the body weight or surface area of the subject to be treated. The size of the dose also will be determined by the existence nature and extent of any adverse side effects that accompany the administration of a particular compound in a particular subject. In determining the effective amount of the compound to be administered in the treatment or prophylaxis of the disorder being treated the physician can evaluate factors such as the circulating plasma levels of the compound compound toxicities and or the progression of the disease etc. In general the dose equivalent of a compound is from about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg for a typical subject.

For administration compounds of the formula I can be administered at a rate determined by factors that can include but are not limited to the LDof the compound the pharmacokinetic profile of the compound contraindicated drugs and the side effects of the compound at various concentrations as applied to the mass and overall health of the subject. Administration can be accomplished via single or divided doses.
