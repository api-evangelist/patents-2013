This disclosure relates in general to the field of communications and more particularly to providing for abstracting and orchestrating mobile data networks in a network environment.

The phenomenal growth of mobile networking is presenting mobile operators with tremendous opportunities along with corresponding challenges as they race to add capacity and services to meet accelerating demands. Mobile operators worldwide are seeing tremendous growth in mobile data subscriptions and bandwidth usage. The emergence of free over the top and offnet applications and services such as those from Skype gaming vendors and applications stores is impacting the return on investment ROI of mobile operators. Consumers can utilize these applications and services which use the operator s network without providing even an incremental usage fee to the mobile operator. While operators benefit in the near term with new subscriptions long term there are profitability challenges from the explosion of data traffic. To take advantage of the mobile internet explosion mobile operators must add value to third party service transactions. This value can be extracted in terms of new revenue and profit. Without this value add mobile operators risk becoming simply a bandwidth bit pipe provider. As a result it is critical for mobile operators to invest strategically in their network assets allowing them to launch new services and go beyond flat rate data plans. In current networks various pieces of information such as the location of a subscriber the reachability of a subscriber etc. are distributed in various network elements throughout the network. Furthermore there is no single entity in the network that can aggregate the information present in the different network elements correlate the information and feed that information to various external entities.

A method is provided in one example and includes receiving data from a network element determining a candidate data processing task for the received data based upon a first similarity metric between the received data and data currently associated with the candidate data processing task and sending the received data to the candidate data processing task. In more particular embodiments the method further includes receiving an indication regarding whether the candidate data processing task has accepted the received data. In still another embodiment the method further includes updating similarity information for the candidate data processing task based upon whether the candidate data processing task has accepted the received data. In still other particular embodiments the method further includes determining a next candidate data processing task if the candidate data processing task indicates that the data processing task has not accepted the received data.

In a more particular embodiment the method further includes determining by the candidate data processing task whether the received data is suitable for the candidate data processing task based upon a second similarity metric. In still another particular embodiment the method further includes sending a message indicative of whether the candidate data processing task has accepted the received data based upon whether the received data is suitable for the data processing task. In still another particular embodiment the method further includes processing the received data by the candidate data processing task according to at least one predefined rule.

The phenomenal growth of mobile networking is presenting mobile operators with tremendous opportunities along with corresponding challenges as they race to add capacity and services to meet accelerating demands. Mobile operators worldwide are seeing tremendous growth in mobile data subscriptions and bandwidth usage. The emergence of free over the top and offnet applications and services such as those from Skype gaming vendors and applications stores is impacting the return on investment ROI of mobile operators. Consumers can utilize these applications and services which use the operator s network without providing even an incremental usage fee to the mobile operator. While operators benefit in the near term with new subscriptions long term there are profitability challenges from the explosion of data traffic. To take advantage of the mobile Internet explosion mobile operators must add value to third party service transactions. This value can be extracted in terms of new revenue and profit. Without this value add mobile operators risk becoming simply a bandwidth bit pipe provider. As a result it is critical for mobile operators to invest strategically in their network assets allowing them to launch new services and go beyond flat rate data plans. In current networks various pieces of information like the location of a subscriber the reachability of a subscriber etc. are distributed in various network elements throughout the network. There is no single entity in the network that can aggregate the information present in the different network elements correlate the information and feed that information to various external entities.

The current challenges for creating new services include Long time to availability 12 18 months to enable services service silos building one service doesn t always help build the second service personalization each service has unique requirements No killer application market conditions vary between operators and regions lag in response times can t quickly create or modify services in response to market trends. While operators have significant challenges they also have significant market advantages and unique value. For example application developers are clamoring to leverage information only available in the network. Application provider challenges include Restricted or no access to the network no real time access do not want to understand the operator topology difficult to correlate multiple sources vendors and no standard interface to carrier applications services.

Mobile operators have the opportunity to leverage the key asset in their networks real time subscriber application and network intelligence and build an architecture that harvests this intelligence to monetize the network. Various embodiments described herein provide a monetization architecture that increases service velocity quickly enabling multiple use cases while providing a platform for application developers to leverage the network. This may provide increased revenue for both the operator and application developers while enhancing the subscriber experience.

At least one embodiment solves the problem of abstracting out data from different sources and organizing the data into a coherent format that can be translated into one or more external protocols such as HTTP XMPP diameter etc. Existing systems are not capable of correlating data from multiple sources perform analytics and present the information in a coherent format in a network wide scalable way. In addition existing systems require more than one entity to perform similar functions but still lack scalability to provide network scale solutions.

In various embodiments network service and subscriber abstraction module may further function as a data flow engine that incrementally correlates the data from various sources to extract useful network wide information. This along with high horizontal scalability allows network service and subscriber abstraction module to provide network level abstraction. In various embodiments network service and subscriber abstraction module collects network wide data performs a set of transformations on the data and correlates the data to make it presentable in a coherent format that can be used by entities outside network service and subscriber abstraction module .

In one or more embodiments network service and subscriber abstraction module is built as a cluster of physical processing nodes in which each node in the cluster holds several logical processing entities. A cluster is made up a logical grouping of one or more nodes. A node is a physical processing element within a cluster with processor resources memory resources and storage resources. The logical entities on each node in the system are termed data control tasks DCT s and data processor tasks DPT s . Accordingly each node has a DCT process and multiple DPT s based upon availability of computational resources. The DCT is a logical entity in each node responsible for routing of the data to appropriate data processing elements that are the DPT s. The DCT in addition to routing of the data may also perform any protocol normalization by converting protocol transactions HTTP Diameter XMPP Netflow IPFix etc. into internal logical operations understood by the DPT s. The DPT s act as repositories of data as well as the processing elements that perform distributed operations on the data. The DPT s support a number of primitive operations that can be combined together via configuration information to performs complex operations. In one or more embodiments the configuration itself can be performed via a command line interface or a web interface.

In particular embodiments communication system provides for a flexible mobile architecture framework that enables operators to quickly create and modify use cases for monetization by harvesting abstracting and monetizing intelligence from the network. Monetization uses which may include such services as general consumer control points targeted ad insertion video Femto Wi Fi location presence information Telepresence congestion control telematics remote video surveillance automatic metering infrastructure ATM POS remote monitoring automation information display IMS cloud voice and video over LTE and messaging.

Similarly second processing node includes processor s memory element network and service and subscriber module . Second processing node further includes a DCT a number of DPTs associated with DCT and a storage device . DCT is responsible for routing data received by second processing node to one or more of DPT based on a similarity measure such that similar data is preferably routed to the same DPT. One or more of DPT processes the data and stores the processed data within storage device

Although the particular embodiment illustrated in shows server as including first processing node and second processing node it should be understood that in other embodiments server may include any number of processing nodes. In still other embodiments a cluster may be formed of any number of processing nodes distributed throughout a number of servers or other network elements within the communication network.

In one implementation first processing node and second processing node include software to achieve or to foster the abstraction operations as outlined herein in this Specification. Note that in one example each of these elements can have an internal structure e.g. a processor a memory element etc. to facilitate some of the operations described herein. In other embodiments the abstraction operations may be executed externally to these elements or included in some other network element to achieve this intended functionality. Alternatively first processing node and second processing node may include this software or reciprocating software that can coordinate with other network elements in order to achieve the operations as outlined herein. In still other embodiments one or several devices may include any suitable algorithms hardware software components modules interfaces or objects that facilitate the operations thereof.

A particular DCT is responsible for distributing data between different nodes or DPTs that are the fundamental entities that perform the processing of data. In particular embodiments routing of data by a DCT is based upon the nature of the data. Data that is determined to be related is preferably routed to the same DPT. If the data is not determined to be related the DCT attempts to distribute it to different nodes for processing. In one or more embodiments data is determined to be related based upon one or more similarity metrics. For example a subscriber may have a particular location associated with the subscriber an IP address associated with the subscriber or a certain number of bearers created on some network element for the subscriber. Data having these same characteristics may be determined to be related. In some embodiments a hierarchical relationship may exist between data and this hierarchical information may be utilized to determine similarity metrics between data in order to route the data.

DPTs may function to store the data itself as well as perform incremental processing of the data. In a particular embodiment DPTs may perform incremental computations on the data and store some partially computed data so that when some entity queries for the data the partially correlated data may be retrieved and the correlations may be completed to generate the queried for data. In various embodiments rules may be conferred upon a particular DPT such that if particular data received by the DPT is changing a running tabulation is kept running so that if the information is requested by a query minimal processing will be performed at the time of query. For example if a particular rule indicates that a number of visits to a particular web site should be tracked this information can be automatically collected and the number of visits can be incrementally computed so that when this information is queried it may be provided quickly. In some embodiments most of the information may be stored in memory for speed of access however some data may be stored in a particular storage device such as an internal hard drive storage area network SAN or persistent storage.

As used herein in this Specification the term network element is meant to encompass routers switches gateways bridges loadbalancers firewalls inline service nodes proxies servers processors modules or any other suitable device component element proprietary appliance or object operable to exchange information in a network environment. This network element may include any suitable hardware software components modules interfaces or objects that facilitate the operations thereof. This may be inclusive of appropriate algorithms and communication protocols that allow for the effective exchange of data or information.

In one or more embodiments DCT and DCT may further include a security manager component and security manager component respectively to handle access control and secure communication between network elements and endpoints . Security manager component functions to protect data and infrastructure such as endpoint and DPTs and security manager component functions to protect data and infrastructure such as endpoint and DPTs . Some of the security features that may be provided by security manager component for example to protect from external access include providing identity management and integration as well as security policies for access control checking requests from network element or a function call from external API users ensuring that access to endpoint and DPTs are permitted and that attacked are blocked. In particular embodiments a single sign on SSO token may be used to share the security status without a congested federation server regardless of whether the token was issued locally or from another system. Some of the security features that may be provided by security manager component to protect infrastructure include trusting all systems in the datacenter s using a cloud key so that a malicious server from inside will not be able to intercept traffic and using normal cryptography for data security and secure sockets layer SSL for connection security etc. In particular embodiments the cloud key may be automatically maintained synchronously and integrated with SSO.

In DCT determines whether the candidate DPT has accepted the data. In a particular embodiment the candidate DPT determines whether the data received from DCT is similar to data it is currently handling using a similarity metric. In particular embodiments the similarity metric evaluated by the candidate DPT is representative of a deeper analysis of similarity than that performed by DCT . After determining whether the candidate DPT has accepted the data the candidate DPT may send a response to DCT indicative of whether the candidate DPT has accepted the data. If DCT determines in that the candidate DPT does not accept the data the procedure continues to . In DCT updates similarity information for the candidate DPT indicating that the candidate DPT is not suitable for the type of data associated with the received data. In DCT determines a next candidate DPT based upon the updated similarity information and returns to in which the data is routed to the next candidate DPT for acceptance or rejection by the next candidate DPT in .

If DCT determines in that the candidate DPT has accepted the data in DCT updates similarity information for the candidate DPT indicative that the type of the data is a match for the candidate DPT. The procedure then ends. For subsequent transactions DCT has a greater idea regarding how to route subsequent data as the probability of choosing a wrong candidate DPT becomes lower every time data passes through DCT . Because DCT has better confidence for the particular kind of data the probability of choosing a wrong candidate DPT tends to decrease. In addition if a DPT crashes or otherwise becomes inoperative DCT may repeat the procedure to restore its routing capability that eliminates the need to send broadcast messages to relearn this information.

If the candidate DPT determines in that the received data is suitable for the candidate DPT the candidate DPT accepts the received data in . In a particular embodiment the candidate DPT sends a message to DCT indicative of the candidate DPT accepting the received data. The procedure then continues to in which the candidate DPT processes the received data according to one or more predefined rules. For example a particular rule may indicate that a particular entity should be notified if a particular set of data changes. In another example one or more rules may indicate that a history or analytics should be kept for particular data. The procedure then ends.

Process manager manages the functional blocks within the DCT process and may provide for process level abstraction within the DCT process. Message routing manager manages routing of messages towards other nodes in the cluster and performs selection of the resource based on load weight etc. In particular embodiments message routing manager determines the most optimal way of delivering messages within the system. Message routing manager includes a functional API interface with config stats API and a message interface with message task scheduling . Data end point API provides an interface between endpoint manger module and the endpoints within the DCT process.

In some embodiments the DCT process may further include security manager component as previously discussed with respect to . In particular embodiments security manager component may be located between DB API and configuration manager and data manager and between config stats API and configuration manager data manager endpoint manager module and message routing manager .

Note that in certain example implementations the data abstraction functions outlined herein may be implemented by logic encoded in one or more tangible media e.g. embedded logic provided in an application specific integrated circuit ASIC digital signal processor DSP instructions software potentially inclusive of object code and source code to be executed by a processor or other similar machine etc. . In some of these instances a memory element as shown in can store data used for the operations described herein. This includes the memory element being able to store software logic code or processor instructions that are executed to carry out the activities described in this Specification. A processor can execute any type of instructions associated with the data to achieve the operations detailed herein in this Specification. In one example the processor as shown in could transform an element or an article e.g. data from one state or thing to another state or thing. In another example the activities outlined herein may be implemented with fixed logic or programmable logic e.g. software computer instructions executed by a processor and the elements identified herein could be some type of a programmable processor programmable digital logic e.g. a field programmable gate array FPGA an erasable programmable read only memory EPROM an electrically erasable programmable ROM EEPROM or an ASIC that includes digital logic software code electronic instructions or any suitable combination thereof.

In one example implementation server may include software in order to achieve the data abstraction functions outlined herein. These activities can be facilitated by network service and subscriber abstraction modules where these modules can be suitably combined in any appropriate manner which may be based on particular configuration and or provisioning needs . Server can include memory elements for storing information to be used in achieving the data abstraction activities as discussed herein. Additionally server may include a processor that can execute software or an algorithm to perform the data abstraction operations as disclosed in this Specification. These devices may further keep information in any suitable memory element random access memory RAM ROM EPROM EEPROM ASIC etc. software hardware or in any other suitable component device element or object where appropriate and based on particular needs.

Similarly any of the potential processing elements modules and machines described in this Specification should be construed as being encompassed within the broad term processor. Each of the network elements can also include suitable interfaces for receiving transmitting and or otherwise communicating data or information in a network environment.

Note that with the example provided above as well as numerous other examples provided herein interaction may be described in terms of two three or four network elements. However this has been done for purposes of clarity and example only. In certain cases it may be easier to describe one or more of the functionalities of a given set of flows by only referencing a limited number of network elements. It should be appreciated that communication system and its teachings are readily scalable and can accommodate a large number of components as well as more complicated sophisticated arrangements and configurations. Accordingly the examples provided should not limit the scope or inhibit the broad teachings of communication system as potentially applied to a myriad of other architectures.

It is also important to note that the steps in the preceding flow diagrams illustrate only some of the possible signaling scenarios and patterns that may be executed by or within communication system . Some of these steps may be deleted or removed where appropriate or these steps may be modified or changed considerably without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. In addition a number of these operations have been described as being executed concurrently with or in parallel to one or more additional operations. However the timing of these operations may be altered considerably. The preceding operational flows have been offered for purposes of example and discussion. Substantial flexibility is provided by communication system in that any suitable arrangements chronologies configurations and timing mechanisms may be provided without departing from the teachings of the present disclosure.

Although the present disclosure has been described in detail with reference to particular arrangements and configurations these example configurations and arrangements may be changed significantly without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example although the present disclosure has been described with reference to particular communication exchanges involving certain endpoint components and certain protocols communication system may be applicable to other protocols and arrangements. Moreover the present disclosure is equally applicable to various technologies aside from mobile architectures as these have only been offered for purposes of discussion.

Additionally although communication system has been illustrated with reference to particular elements and operations that facilitate the communication process these elements and operations may be replaced by any suitable architecture or process that achieves the intended functionality of communication system .
