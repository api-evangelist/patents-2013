Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations including a first generation analog wireless phone service 1G a second generation 2G digital wireless phone service including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks and third generation 3G and fourth generation 4G high speed data Internet capable wireless services. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use including Cellular and Personal Communications Service PCS systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System AMPS and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Frequency Division Multiple Access FDMA Time Division Multiple Access TDMA the Global System for Mobile access GSM variation of TDMA and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.

More recently Long Term Evolution LTE has been developed as a wireless communications protocol for wireless communication of high speed data for mobile phones and other data terminals. LTE is based on GSM and includes contributions from various GSM related protocols such as Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution EDGE and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS protocols such as High Speed Packet Access HSPA .

Certain types of user equipments UEs such as smart phones tablet computers and the like are built on a mobile operating system and can download and install third party applications a.k.a. apps . These UEs have a number of hardware subsystems that can be accessed by installed applications to provide features and functionality to a user.

Multiple applications residing above the operating system level may wish to simultaneously leverage multiple context awareness services residing below the operating system level. This can impact power consumption. Examples of such services include geo fencing place clustering audio environment clustering target sound detection e.g. speech typing motion state and device position classification proximity discovery target situation detection e.g. driving in meeting alone sleeping etc. and the like.

In many cases the performance of a context awareness service degrades gradually when the power allocated to it is reduced. For example the performance of a speech detector or an audio clustering algorithm operating on duty cycled audio data degrades gracefully when the duty cycle is reduced. This suggests that rather than allowing power consumption to increase with each new service or arbitrarily killing services the power allocated should simply be adjusted to satisfy the constraints of a power budget.

Referring to the communication device includes logic configured to receive and or transmit information . In an example if the communication device corresponds to a wireless communications device e.g. UE A or B the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can include a wireless communications interface e.g. Bluetooth WiFi 2G CDMA W CDMA 3G 4G LTE etc. such as a wireless transceiver and associated hardware e.g. an RF antenna a MODEM a modulator and or demodulator etc. . In another example the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can correspond to a wired communications interface e.g. a serial connection a USB or Firewire connection an Ethernet connection through which the Internet can be accessed etc. .

In a further example the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can include sensory or measurement hardware by which the communication device can monitor its local environment e.g. an accelerometer a temperature sensor a light sensor an antenna for monitoring local RF signals etc. . The logic configured to receive and or transmit information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to receive and or transmit information to perform its reception and or transmission function s . However the logic configured to receive and or transmit information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to receive and or transmit information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further includes logic configured to process information . In an example the logic configured to process information can include at least a processor. Example implementations of the type of processing that can be performed by the logic configured to process information includes but is not limited to performing determinations establishing connections making selections between different information options performing evaluations related to data interacting with sensors coupled to the communication device to perform measurement operations converting information from one format to another e.g. between different protocols such as .wmv to .avi etc. and so on. For example the processor included in the logic configured to process information can correspond to a general purpose processor a digital signal processor DSP an ASIC a field programmable gate array FPGA or other programmable logic device discrete gate or transistor logic discrete hardware components or any combination thereof designed to perform the functions described herein. A general purpose processor may be a microprocessor but in the alternative the processor may be any conventional processor controller microcontroller or state machine. A processor may also be implemented as a combination of computing devices e.g. a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor a plurality of microprocessors one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a DSP core or any other such configuration. The logic configured to process information may also include logic configured to determine a power budget and logic configured to allocate power resources . The logic configured to process information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to process information to perform its processing function s . However the logic configured to process information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to process information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further includes logic configured to store information . In an example the logic configured to store information can include at least a non transitory memory and associated hardware e.g. a memory controller etc. . For example the non transitory memory included in the logic configured to store information can correspond to RAM flash memory ROM erasable programmable ROM EPROM EEPROM registers hard disk a removable disk a CD ROM or any other form of storage medium known in the art. The logic configured to store information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to store information to perform its storage function s . However the logic configured to store information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to store information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further optionally includes logic configured to present information . In an example the logic configured to present information can include at least an output device and associated hardware. For example the output device can include a video output device e.g. a display screen a port that can carry video information such as USB HDMI etc. an audio output device e.g. speakers a port that can carry audio information such as a microphone jack USB HDMI etc. a vibration device and or any other device by which information can be formatted for output or actually outputted by a user or operator of the communication device . For example if the communication device corresponds to UE A or UE B as shown in the logic configured to present information can include the display A of UE A or the touchscreen display B of UE B. In a further example the logic configured to present information can be omitted for certain communication devices such as network communication devices that do not have a local user e.g. network switches or routers remote servers etc. . The logic configured to present information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to present information to perform its presentation function s . However the logic configured to present information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to present information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further optionally includes logic configured to receive local user input .

Referring to while the configured logics of through are shown as separate or distinct blocks in it will be appreciated that the hardware and or software by which the respective configured logic performs its functionality can overlap in part. For example any software used to facilitate the functionality of the configured logics of through can be stored in the non transitory memory associated with the logic configured to store information such that the configured logics of through each performs their functionality i.e. in this case software execution based in part upon the operation of software stored by the logic configured to store information . Likewise hardware that is directly associated with one of the configured logics can be borrowed or used by other configured logics from time to time. For example the processor of the logic configured to process information can format data into an appropriate format before being transmitted by the logic configured to receive and or transmit information such that the logic configured to receive and or transmit information performs its functionality i.e. in this case transmission of data based in part upon the operation of hardware i.e. the processor associated with the logic configured to process information .

Generally unless stated otherwise explicitly the phrase logic configured to as used throughout this disclosure is intended to invoke an aspect that is at least partially implemented with hardware and is not intended to map to software only implementations that are independent of hardware. Also it will be appreciated that the configured logic or logic configured to in the various blocks are not limited to specific logic gates or elements but generally refer to the ability to perform the functionality described herein either via hardware or a combination of hardware and software . Thus the configured logics or logic configured to as illustrated in the various blocks are not necessarily implemented as logic gates or logic elements despite sharing the word logic. Other interactions or cooperation between the logic in the various blocks will become clear to one of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the aspects described below in more detail.

Certain types of UEs such as smart phones tablet computers and the like are built on a mobile operating system and can download and install third party applications a.k.a. apps . These UEs have a number of hardware subsystems that can be accessed by installed applications to provide features and functionality to a user.

Multiple applications residing above the operating system level may wish to simultaneously leverage multiple context awareness services residing below the operating system level. This can impact power consumption. Examples of such services include geo fencing place clustering audio environment clustering target sound detection e.g. speech typing motion state and device position classification proximity discovery target situation detection e.g. driving in meeting alone sleeping etc. and the like.

In many cases the performance of a context awareness service degrades gradually when the power allocated to it is reduced. For example the performance of a speech detector or an audio clustering algorithm operating on duty cycled audio data degrades gracefully when the duty cycle is reduced. This suggests that rather than allowing power consumption to increase with each new service or arbitrarily killing services the power allocated should simply be adjusted to satisfy the constraints of a power budget.

Accordingly the disclosure provides for dynamic power management of context awareness services. At the highest level this involves adjusting the power allocated to each context awareness service currently running when an application new or otherwise requests a new context awareness service to begin. The power allocation can be adjusted such that a total power budget is never exceeded. This may involve a flat power allocation i.e. allocating the same amount of power to each context aware service or a dynamic power allocation i.e. allocating different amounts of power to each context aware service based on priority.

Each context awareness service may have a power performance tradeoff. That is as power decreases performance decreases and as power increases performance increases. illustrates an exemplary power performance graph for a speech detector context awareness service. Here the performance metric may be the accuracy of the speech detector that is whether it correctly identifies whether or not the user is speaking. The speech detector may operate by sampling small snippets of speech with some duty cycle and making a decision every minute for example as to whether or not speech is present in the audio stream. By increasing the duty cycle the performance improves at the cost of increased power consumption. The power performance tradeoff of each service can be taken into consideration when computing the power budget.

A utility function can be used to map the performance metrics of all running context awareness services to a single metric that can be optimized. If the performance metric of the ith service is denoted f r as a function of the power allocated to the ith service the utility function takes the form . . . . . . . For example 

One can then find a power allocation r r . . . that maximizes the utility function subject to the constraint that the total power allocated not exceed some fixed threshold i.e. r R. There are a plethora of methods that can be used to solve this problem. If the problem is convex one approach is to use gradient descent.

A brute force approach using lookup tables can solve this problem without the need for such online optimization. This involves pre determining pre computing a power allocation r r . . . for each possible subset of concurrent services. However as the number of possible subsets grows very rapidly with the total number of possible services this approach could be infeasible.

There can be multiple applications running each utilizing a different subset possibly overlapping of context awareness services. If some services are utilized by a greater number of applications it may be desirable to weight these services more heavily when computing a power allocation. One example of how to incorporate weightings in the utility function is

The context aware applications subscribe to aware events using an aware manager . The aware manager configures the selected context awareness services on behalf of the context aware applications in this case the sensor subsystem the WiFi and GPS subsystem and the audio subsystem . The context aware applications also create configure the rules contained in a reasoning engine that are applied to detected context events.

The sensor subsystems and the context aware applications and the reasoning engine communicate with each other regarding context events via the chip infrastructure .

When multiple context awareness services are running concurrently the total power consumption may be unequal to the sum of the power consumptions of each service running in isolation. This phenomenon may result from low level optimizations such as synchronized wake up times for concurrent services. It may also result when different running context awareness services utilize shared sensor subsystems. For example if an audio clustering service is running concurrently with a speech detection service both services may access the same duty cycled audio data stream. illustrates an example of this. Specifically sensor subsystems and are each associated with multiple context awareness services.

This problem can be solved by performing power budget accounting at the level of sensor subsystems instead of at the level of context awareness services. This can be done by using a utility function derived from the three tier system illustrated in . Each application may require multiple context awareness services to be running with each context awareness service utilizing multiple sensor subsystems. For example one application may require geo fencing and speech detection services a second may require geo fencing and in meeting detection a third may require in meeting detection and audio clustering. Speech detection and audio clustering may utilize the audio subsystem geo fencing may utilize the GPS subsystem and the sensor subsystem and the in meeting detection may utilize the sensor subsystem and the audio subsystem.

In turn the first context awareness service can utilize a first sensor subsystem a second sensor subsystem up to the Pth sensor subsystem . The second context awareness service can also utilize the first sensor subsystem the second sensor subsystem up to the Pth sensor subsystem . Although not illustrated the Mth content awareness service may also utilize one or more of the sensor subsystems and .

The sensor subsystems are defined as components of the hardware architecture that reside on separate power islands. This means the power consumption of a group of sensor subsystems running concurrently is equal to the sum of the power consumptions of the individual sensor subsystems running in isolation.

If the performance metric of the ith service is denoted f r where Xdenotes the subset of subsystems utilized by the ith service and rdenotes the power of the jth subsystem the utility function takes the form . . . . . . .

For example if three services are running utilizing a total of three subsystems with the first service utilizing the first subsystem the second utilizing all three subsystems and the third utilizing the second and third subsystems then the optimization problem is

By dynamically managing the power allocated to different context awareness services or sensor subsystems utilized by such services a seamless user experience is ensured where neither device battery life nor application performance is adversely affected.

The power budget may be determined based on default or preprogrammed settings the user s selection of a power management profile or the battery level of the UE. The power management profile may define the amount of power resources to make available for context awareness services based on various criteria such as the battery level of the UE whether or not the UE is charging whether or not the UE is connected to a wireless access network the location of the UE and the like.

At important context awareness services and or hardware subsystems are identified. An important context awareness service includes one that is utilized by multiple applications. The more applications that utilize a context awareness service the greater its importance. Similarly an important hardware subsystem includes one that is utilized by multiple context awareness services and or by a context awareness service that is utilized by multiple applications. The greater the number of context awareness services utilizing the hardware subsystem and or the greater the number of applications utilizing one or more context awareness services utilizing the hardware subsystem the greater the hardware subsystem s importance.

At power resources are allocated to the hardware subsystems based on their importance. For example additional power resources are allocated to shared context awareness services and or hardware subsystems. The allocation of the power resources is performed within the power budget. That is the UE does not allocate more power resources to the hardware subsystems than is permitted by the power budget.

At cumulative performance metrics are determined for the context awareness services. The cumulative performance metrics are a function of the performance power trade off of each context awareness service as described with reference to . The performance metrics may be observed over time and or may be provided in a lookup table. The lookup table can list the preferred amount of power resources for each context awareness service and or hardware subsystem and or a mapping of power resources to accuracy of the context awareness service. That is a row in the lookup table could list a power level for the context awareness service or hardware subsystem and a corresponding accuracy of the context awareness service.

If the performance metrics are provided in a lookup table then may be performed before . Accordingly at the allocation of the power resources would take into consideration the performance metrics provided in the lookup table.

At a determination is made as to whether or not the performance metrics for the context awareness services have fallen below a threshold. The determination may be for the cumulative performance metrics for all running context awareness services or the performance metrics of each running context awareness service.

If at none of the performance metrics have fallen below the threshold then the flow returns to . However if the performance metrics of one or more of the context awareness services or the cumulative performance metrics have fallen below the threshold then at the power allocation is increased. The overall power allocation may be increased in the case of the cumulative performance metrics falling below the threshold of the power allocation for the one or more context awareness services whose performance metrics fell below the threshold may be increased. The increase of the power allocation should however stay within the determined power budget.

The status of the UE can change which can cause the determination of a new power budget. In that case the flow would return to . Alternatively a new context awareness service can begin or a currently running one end and the flow would return to .
