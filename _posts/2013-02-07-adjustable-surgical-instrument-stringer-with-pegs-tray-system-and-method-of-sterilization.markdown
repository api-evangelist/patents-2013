The disclosure generally relates to surgical instrument receptacle organizational system and more specifically is related to a stringer and tray system for retaining a collection of surgical instruments for sterilization transport and storage.

Present day surgical procedures regularly use sets of pre selected surgical instruments for a specified surgical procedure such as clamps hemostat forceps scissors retractors and the like. These instruments are regularly grouped together to form a set. The set of surgical instruments is stored in a sterilized condition until required for surgery. Prior to sterilization the set of surgical instruments is subject to a time consuming multi step sorting identifying grouping cleaning and sterilization process. The set of surgical instruments is collected post operation co mingled in a wire mesh basket or holed tray for transport to the central sterile processing area. Next the basket or tray of surgical instruments is placed in a wash sink to brush and manually wash the surgical instruments to remove any foreign debris such as tissue or dried body fluid. Next the basket or tray of surgical instruments is transported to and run through an automated washer decontaminator. Next the basket or tray of surgical instruments is transported to and emptied out on a sorting table where a technician inspects counts and sorts each surgical instrument into groupings of instruments for a specified surgical procedure. Next pivoting or hinged scissor like surgical instruments are commonly sequentially grouped using a fixed stringer bar or retaining rod positioned through both of the finger rings or ring handles and the set is laid or positioned in a basket or tray. Next the basket or tray of surgical instruments is placed in a sealed container and sealed before entering the sterilization machine. Next the wrapped or containerized basket or tray of surgical instruments is placed in an industrial sterilization machine autoclave for sterilization of the surgical instruments. Next the sealed sterilization container of surgical instruments is stored until transported to an operating area for use as required. When needed the sterilized surgical instruments are transported to the operating room where the surgical instruments are removed from the basket or tray and arranged on a stand or instrument roll in a configuration that enables efficient transfer to a surgeon.

Much time is utilized during the process of cleaning sorting counting and grouping procedure for the assembly and sterilization of surgical instruments. In addition the onset of infectious diseases has dramatically increased the biohazard risk for medical personnel and central sterile personnel handling post operation cleaning sorting counting and grouping of surgical instruments due to potential contact with sharp surgical instruments such as needles. Such contact may result in loss of work for recovery testing for contamination and or a workers compensation claim.

Furthermore surgical instruments are often damaged when transported stacked one on the other as well as when the surgical instruments are emptied out on a sorting table for a technician to inspect count and sort. Such handling may scratch bend and may even break the surgical instruments resulting in increased cost to replace such instruments which are often delicate and expensive. Such damage to the surgical instruments reduces the life expectancy of the surgical instruments resulting in increased medical costs to replace the surgical instruments. Moreover if such damaged surgical instruments are accidentally returned to the operating room such surgical procedures may be delayed or cancelled due to non functioning surgical instruments causing lost revenue for the surgery center and an upset surgical team and patients in queue.

Still further the environmental impact of the above multi step process of pre washing automated washer decontaminator and running the surgical instruments through industrial sterilization machine autoclave requires large quantities of water sterilization chemicals and energy.

Yet still further counting the surgical instruments before and after surgical procedures is particularly important for ensuring that no instruments are left in the patient after the operation procedure has been completed.

Yet still further one problem with fixed or hinged stringers bars or retaining rods is that the stringer is not adjustable to string group or accommodate a variety of surgical instruments nor do such fixed stringers enable adjustment to hold or maintain a variety of surgical instruments in an open position ready for sorting identifying grouping cleaning and sterilization.

Therefore it is readily apparent that there is a recognizable unmet need for an adjustable surgical instrument stringer with pegs and tray system and method of sterilization that reduces the time spent cleaning sorting counting identifying and grouping surgical instrument extends the life expectancy of the surgical instruments provides an adjustable stringer and decreases the contamination potential of the surgical instruments by maintaining the surgical instruments in a side by side open configuration during cleaning and sterilization.

Moreover one exemplary function of the extension and retraction capability of connector C F shown in FIG. and D E is to enable stringer A to accommodate additional expansion or fewer retraction numbers of surgical instruments I along y axis Y. Such extension and retraction maintains a tight y axis Y fit around ring handles R of the group surgical instruments I and holds the group surgical instruments I in an erect position. Such erect position space between instruments and organization of the group surgical instruments I enables shortened time to identify clean whether pre wash pressure washing or the like sort count group and sterilize surgical instrument I. Moreover such erect position space between instruments and organization of the group surgical instruments I reduces instrument damage when transporting stacking sorting inspecting and counting and additionally when positioning on a sorting table for a technician to inspect count and sort. Still further such extension and retraction of connector C F shown in FIG. and D E enables stringer A to adjust and accommodate a variety of sizes of surgical instruments I I and numbers or groups of surgical instruments I.

Thereafter the surgical instruments I are preferably handled as a group of surgical instruments I bound together by stringer A through the multi step sorting identifying grouping cleaning and sterilization process. Such bundling of surgical instruments I preferably helps to protect surgical instruments I from damage when transported stacked one on the other as well as when the surgical instruments are emptied out on a sorting table no longer required for a technician to inspect count and sort. Such handling may scratch bend and may even break the surgical instruments resulting in increased cost to replace such instruments which are often delicate and expensive. Moreover such damage to the surgical instruments reduces the life expectancy of the surgical instruments resulting in increased medical costs to replace the surgical instruments. Furthermore if such damaged surgical instruments are accidentally returned to the operating room such surgical procedures may be delayed or cancelled due to non functioning surgical instruments causing lost revenue for the surgery center and an upset surgical team and patients in queue.

Moreover one exemplary function of the release and latch capability of connectors A and B shown in is to enable stringer A to accommodate surgical instruments I in an open position O and upright. Such release and latch of connector A and B shown in maintains x axis X spacing between first ring handle R and second ring handle R of the group surgical instruments I. Such movement of first ring handle R and second ring handle R causes shank S and shank S to pivot about pivot point P which results in first jaw member J and second jaw members J to likewise pivot about pivot point P. Preferably stringer A holds the group surgical instruments I in an erect position with opposing first jaw member J and second jaw members J held in open position O. Such open position O spacing between instruments and organization of the group surgical instruments I enables more thorough cleaning and sterilization of surgical instruments I. In addition maintaining such open position O between first jaw member J and second jaw members J preferably reduces the time to sort identify inspect group clean and sterilize the group surgical instruments I. Moreover such open position O of the plurality of surgical instruments I strung together by stringer A reduces the number of sharps being sent to central sterile and the reduction of accidents associated with needle sharps injuries retained in a surgical instrument I or hidden in an un organized cluster of surgical instruments I. Such erect position spacing between instruments and organization of the group surgical instruments I enables shortened time to identify clean whether pre wash pressure washing or the like sort count group and sterilize surgical instrument I. Still further such release and latch of connector A and B shown in enables stringer A to adjust and accommodate a variety of sizes of surgical instruments I and groups of surgical instruments I.

The grouped set of surgical instruments I may be positioned in valleys step and by adjusting stringer A wherein the surgical instruments I may be identified counted sorted and positioned in an organized parallel relationship in valleys to form a set or group of surgical instruments I. While surgical instruments I have been retained even spaced with open jaw by stringer A and surgical instrument support tray system an assembler may quickly inspect identify sort count disengage any of the surgical instruments I for further inspection and operational testing and grouping of surgical instruments I inspecting step . Thus surgical instrument support tray system reduces the time spent cleaning sorting counting identifying and grouping surgical instruments I extends the life expectancy of the surgical instruments and enables thorough cleaning of the surgical instruments.

In block or step surgical instruments I may be gathered together on one end of stringer stringer may be contracted or adjusted and laid as a group of surgical instruments I on bottom of tray bottom and tray top may be positioned on tray bottom wherein the basket like housing or enclosure maintains surgical instruments I in an organized and secure position for sterilization transportation and storage for later use.

In block or step the grouped set of surgical instruments I may be removed from tray bottom and the grouped set of surgical instruments I may be positioned in or across valleys on tray top by adjusting stringer wherein the surgical instruments I may be retained in parallel or nonparallel evenly spaced and an open jaw position by surgical instrument support tray system . In such position the grouped set of surgical instruments I may be sprayed and evenly coated with an enzymatic to begin breaking down post surgery contaminants pre washing step .

In block or step the grouped set of surgical instruments I may be positioned in or across valleys on tray top by adjusting stringer A wherein the surgical instruments I may be retained in parallel or nonparallel evenly spaced and an open jaw position by surgical instrument support tray system by releasably affixing or inserting pegs A B. A B. to or in apertures A of tray top and configured to accommodate shorter shanked surgical instrument sets IA and longer shanked surgical instrument sets IB on one stringer A in wide open position O for better cleaning and sterilization purposes and to enable easy identification pressure washing sorting counting and grouping of surgical instruments IA B.

In block or step the grouped surgical instruments I and stringer may be pre washed by submerging into a detergent pre wash solution or sonification system. In addition grouped surgical instruments I may be positioned in valleys step on tray top by adjusting stringer step wherein the surgical instruments I may be scrubbed or pressure washed to remove any visible contaminants remaining post surgery and inspected for completeness pre washing step .

In block or step surgical instruments I may be gathered together on one end of stringer stringer may be contracted or retracted step with retained parallel spaced and open jaw surgical instruments I and or laid as a group of surgical instruments I on bottom of tray bottom and tray top may be positioned on tray bottom wherein the grouped surgical instruments I or basket like housing or enclosure with surgical instruments I in an organized and secure position and open jaw surgical may be washed in a commercial washer disinfector step . Since surgical instruments I are retained in parallel evenly spaced and in an open jaw position this enables even access of detergents and uniform cleaning of surgical instruments I by a commercial washer disinfector.

In block or step the grouped set of surgical instruments I may be removed from tray bottom and the grouped set of surgical instruments I may be positioned in or across valleys on tray top by adjusting stringer wherein the surgical instruments I may be retained in parallel evenly spaced and an open jaw position by surgical instrument support tray system . While retained an assembler inspects identifies sorts and counts surgical instruments I step . Since surgical instruments I have been previously retained in parallel even spaced with open jaw on surgical instrument support tray system an assembler may quickly inspect identify sort count disengage any of the surgical instruments I for further inspection and operational testing and finally grouping of surgical instruments I. Moreover if one or more surgical instruments I is to be removed or added to the bundled or retained set of surgical instruments I the procedure outlined above for stringer attachment device or alternate stringer attachment devices may be utilized to add or remove surgical instruments I. Thus surgical instrument support tray system and stringer A reduces the time spent cleaning sorting counting identifying and grouping surgical instruments I extends the life expectancy of the surgical instruments and enables thorough cleaning and decontamination of the surgical instruments.

In addition surgical instrument support tray system and stringer A preferably reduces the number of sharps being bundled or hidden with the surgical instruments I and being sent to sterile central.

In block or step and surgical instruments I may be gathered together on one end of stringer A stringer A may be contracted with retained parallel spaced and closed jaw surgical instruments I and laid as a group of surgical instruments I on bottom of tray bottom and tray top and may be positioned on tray bottom wherein the grouped surgical instruments I or basket like housing or enclosure with surgical instruments I in an organized and secure position and open jaw surgical may be wrapped containerized placed in a sterilization container such as a basket with detachable lid or stacked for sterile processing distribution. Surgical instrument support tray s system with stringer A retained parallel spaced and open jaw surgical instruments I may be sterilized step in a commercial sterilizer using steam or other sterilant. The sterilant may access surgical instruments I via a plurality or set of holes such as apertures in surgical instrument support tray system to enable thorough cleaning and sterilization of surgical instruments. Once sterilized surgical instrument support tray s system with stringer retained parallel spaced and open jaw surgical instruments I may be placed in inventory for future surgical use step .
