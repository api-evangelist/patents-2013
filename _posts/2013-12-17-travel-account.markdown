This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 328 477 filed Dec. 16 2011 the entirety of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention generally relates to payment provider accounts and more particularly to using such accounts during travel.

Electronic payments are becoming a preferred method of payment because they offer advantages to the user not present with traditional physical payments. With a physical payment the user is required to carry the funding instrument and present the funding instrument when ready to make a payment. Examples of physical funding instruments include cash checks credit cards debit cards coupons gift certificates gift cards and the like. These can take up space in a user pocket purse or wallet. To reduce space the consumer may not carry all funding instruments all the time resulting in the possibility that a desired funding instrument is not available when the consumer is ready to use it at a point of sale POS . Such physical funding instruments may also be lost or stolen. Thus physical wallets can be cumbersome inconvenient and prone to loss.

To remedy this mobile devices have been and are being used to make payments through payment providers such as PayPal Inc. of San Jose Calif. Such payment providers typically allow a consumer to make a payment through the user s mobile device such as through the use of barcodes communication between the payment provider and the merchant and other methods. After authentication and or authorization the payment is made through a user account with the payment provider where the account is funded through a funding source such as the user s bank or credit card.

However while mobile payments may be convenient they are also prone to fraudulent activity. For example if a user s mobile phone is lost or stolen an unauthorized user may make a fraudulent payment through the mobile phone. As such payment providers use various fraud detection tools to ensure a payment is properly made by an authorized user. One such tool is determining where the payment request is being made. If the user resides in a certain city or state and has made consistent payments within a certain location but then one or more payment requests are made from another region or country the payment provider may deny the payment or require additional authentication before approving the payment. This may be inconvenient for authorized users attempting to make a payment while traveling or at an unfamiliar to the payment provider location.

According to one embodiment a user having an account with a payment provider sets up a travel account that allows the user to specify details of the travel and place restrictions as desired. This enables the payment provider to determine whether a payment request made through the user device is at a location anticipated by the user. If the user is in a foreign country but the payment provider knows the user is at the country during a specified date the payment provider may more easily process a payment request. In addition the user may restrict funds available at one or more different travel destinations to limit exposure to funds during the user s travel.

In one embodiment the user may set up the travel account by indicating to the payment provider dates of travel travel destinations or locations and any restrictions at the one or more locations. The restrictions may be limits to dollar amount number of transactions time of transaction etc.

When the user arrives at a destination specified in the user s travel account the user may make a payment request as follows according to one embodiment. The user logs into the user account with the payment provider such as through a mobile app web site or mobile browser. The user may be asked to enter specific information such as a user name email address password and PIN. In one embodiment the user may also be required to enter a number generated from a security token such as a key fob either physical or downloadable to the user device e.g. a soft token generator . Once authenticated the user may transmit information to the payment provider for the payment request. The information may include location information payee information transaction details and amount. The payment provider may determine the location of the user through various means including through location services on the user device. The payment provider accesses the user s account to determine whether the user is expected to be at the location and any restrictions or limitations on the account.

If the user is at the expected location the payment provider may apply any restrictions or limitations when processing the payment request. For example the payment request may be over the set limit at the current location. If the location is correct and any and all restrictions are met the payment provider may approve the payment request quickly without having the user provide additional information.

However if the payment request cannot be approved initially for a variety of reasons the payment provider may request the user to resubmit information or provide additional information. For example if the location is not the expected location or if the payment request is higher than the specified limit the user may be asked one or more security questions to authenticate the user. If the payment provider is satisfied the user is the authorized user the payment request may be approved.

As a result the user is provided additional security when making payment requests while on travel while at the same time not being inconvenienced with additional security questions because the user is not at a home location.

These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.

To access the user s account the user may be asked to enter specific information such as a user identifier and a login credential. These may include a user name an email address a phone number a password or a PIN. The requested information is then communicated to the payment provider such as through the user device or other means like a phone call or voice. If the user can be authenticated the user is provided access to the user s account by the payment provider.

Once the user accesses the account the user may see a home page of the account. On the home page may be an option to create revise view or otherwise access a travel account. This may be in the form of a tab link button or other user selectable means. The user may select this option at step to access the travel account option. The user may then be directed to a new screen or a pop up screen having travel account information.

At step the user may enter a location or destination for travel. For example the user may be planning a trip to Europe and will be visiting London Rome Venice and Paris. The user may enter the location in any number of ways. For example the user may enter a city a state or province. The user may also select desired location from a map where the user may select a specific region and be presented with a more detailed map of that region such as a map of Europe then Western Europe then Great Britain. The user may be asked to confirm the selected location or revise as needed.

At step the user may select the dates the user plans on being at the selected location. For the selected location the user may enter a start and end date. The user may also select start and end dates from a pop up calendar. For example the user may specify that the user intends to be in London from Feb. 2 2012 to Feb. 5 2012. The user may be asked to confirm the dates for the location. Once confirmed the user may be presented with the selected location and dates. The location and date information may be communicated in other ways. For example the user may provide the payment provider a copy of the user s travel itinerary which the payment provider can scan or otherwise process to populate the user s travel account.

At step the user may select one or more limits at the location or date. For example the user may want to limit account availability to 2000 USD while in London. The user may also or alternatively provide limits according to a day or days. For example the user may set a limit of 100 USD on February 2 1500 USD on February 3 and 200 USD on February 4 and February 5.

At step the user may set other restrictions as desired for the location and or dates. Other restrictions may include the number of transactions allowed each day each period or the location. Additional restrictions may also include time restrictions as to when a payment request is to be allowed or blocked based on when the payment request is made in local time. For example if the user does not plan on doing any purchasing from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. local time the user may specify that any payment requests made during that time should be denied. Restrictions may also include the type of merchant or purchase. For example the user may not expect to make any purchases from street vendors. In that case the user may specify that any payment requests from street vendors be denied. The user may also specify that no payment requests received for digital goods purchases should be approved.

In addition to restrictions the user may specify additional information such as contact information at each location or date s . For example the user may provide a temporary cell phone number for each or all locations hotel contact information etc.

Note that one or more of the above steps may be combined performed in a different sequence omitted or a combination thereof. Once the user has finished providing information for the first location a determination is made at step whether the user wishes to add another location. In the above example London is a first destination for a multi city trip. So the user may want to add the other locations to the travel account. This may be done simply with a button or link from the user account page that the user can select to add another location. If the user is finished adding locations the user may simply select a finish or other similar button or link to end the set up process.

After entering each additional location and limits the user may be presented with information about the current travel account. Once finished the user may be presented with the final travel account information. For example the user may see a page or listing that shows the user intends to be in London from Feb. 2 2012 to Feb. 5 2012 in Rome from Feb. 5 2012 to Feb. 12 2012 in Venice from Feb. 12 2012 to Feb. 14 2012 and in Paris from Feb. 14 2012 to Feb. 21 2012 with any associated limits or restrictions identified alongside each date or location.

The user may access the account at any subsequent time to revise any of the information in the user s travel account such as a change in location a change in dates a change in limits and or a change in restrictions. In one embodiment the user may only change one or more details while still in the user s home country or area. In other embodiments the user may change details at any time prior to the date that the change is to take effect. If this is in another country the user may be asked to provide additional authenticating information before the change is accepted by the payment provider.

The payment provider receives a payment request at step from the user or a payee. The payment request may be from a user device such as a smart phone a payee device such as a merchant POS or a third party device. The payment request may include information about the user such as a mobile phone number a user name user email address or other user identifier if not previously provided during account access the merchant such as a merchant identifier merchant name merchant account number etc. and the transaction such as a total amount of the payment request information about individual items in the purchase request including price and description. Some of this information may be automatically conveyed through the user device e.g. mobile phone number payee device e.g. merchant identifier and or transaction information or third party device.

Upon receiving the payment request the payment provider accesses the user s account at step using information about the user provided either at step or during the login process. The payment provider may search one or more databases having account information to determine whether an account exists for the user. Assuming a valid account exists the payment provider determines at step the user location or the location where the payment request came from. This determination may be accomplished in any number of ways. For example the transaction information may include location information. The location information may also come from the device communicating the payment request such as through an IP address from a PC of the payee merchant or location service on a mobile device of the user.

At step the payment provider access the user s travel account from the user s primary account. This allows the payment provider to determine information contained in the travel account to aid in processing the payment request. Note that one or more of the steps above may be combined performed in a different sequence omitted or a combination thereof.

At step the payment provider processes the payment request based on the information received and available through the user s account and travel account. The payment provider may first determine whether the payment request came from a location designated by the user. For example the user payment request may be determined to have come from Moscow which is not on the user s travel location list. This may prompt the payment provider to deny the payment request or require the user to provide additional information. In another example the user payment request may be determined to have come from London which is a location specified in the user s travel account. This may pass a first test and move the payment provider to additional processing. In yet another example the user payment request location may be determined to have come from a small city just outside of London. Even though the city was not listed in the user travel account an inference or assumption may be made by the payment provider that this is still within the London location. This assumption may depend on various analytics used by the payment provider and may prompt a request for additional information from the user.

Even if the payment request originated from a location identified in the user s travel account the payment provider may still need to determine if the location matches with the dates specified by the user. For example even though the payment request came from London the request may have been sent Jan. 2 2011 which is not a date the user was expected to be in London. As such the payment provider may deny the request or require additional information from the user. However if the payment request was sent on Feb. 4 2012 within the London travel dates the payment provider may proceed with authorization without further involvement from the user assuming other conditions are met.

Processing may continue to determine whether any limits or restrictions are met or triggered. For example the payment provider may determine whether there are any limits associated with the travel account such as a maximum dollar amount or transaction number for the particular location and or date. If that maximum would be exceeded by the payment request the payment provider may deny the request or require additional information from the user. However if approving the payment request would not exceed any limits the payment provider may process and approve the payment without further input from the user.

In a further example the payment provider may determine whether there are any use or time restrictions associated with the location and or date. For example the payment request from London on Feb. 4 2012 is for 1000 is the tenth payment request from the user in London and is made at 4 a.m. London time and is for the purchase of a downloadable game. The payment provider may determine whether any of these conditions violate a limit or restriction for the user travel account. It may be that the dollar amount is within the limit but the user has exceeded the number of payment requests the request was made at a time not permitted by the user and or the type of purchase digital good is not allowed by the user. If one or more restrictions limits are triggered by the payment request the payment provider may deny the request or require the user to provide additional information.

Thus after processing a determination is made at step whether the payment request can be approved. If for whatever reason the payment request cannot be approved by the payment provider the payment provider may optionally communicate with the user at step . Communication may be for requesting additional information in an attempt to better authenticate the user or obtain approval from the user of the payment request. For example the payment provider may call a phone number specified by the user on the travel account or another phone number associated with the user s account. The user may then be asked one or more security questions such as mother s maiden name mother s birthday social security number etc. The payment provider may also ask whether the pending payment request was actually made by the user. The communication may also be through email text or other means. Based on the information received by the payment provider the payment provider may process the request again at step .

If the payment request can be approved a notification may be sent by the payment provider at step . Notification may be to the user and or the payee or merchant via a smart phone PC laptop tablet POS device etc. The notification may be through a receipt confirmation number message or the like and may be conveyed by text email voice or other means. Once the merchant confirms payment either through the merchant the payment provider and or the user the merchant may release the purchase to the user.

As a result the user may easily make a payment while traveling because the payment provider knows the user is expected to be at a certain location on certain dates. This eliminates the need to either deny the payment request or contact the user for additional information which may be needed because of payment provider receives a payment request from a location not associated with the user. As a result using the above the user is provided a better user experience. In addition to easier payment processing while traveling the travel account may also provide the user additional security for payments made abroad. This is due to the user being able to set limits and restrictions on payments made while on travel. Note that the travel account may be a separate account linked to the user s main payment provider account or part of the user s main payment provider account such that travel account is with the main account where the user can select a tab or link to toggle between the travel account and the main account.
