This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 523 727 filed Jun. 14 2012 which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 11 966 875 filed Dec. 28 2007 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 214 288 issued Jul. 3 2012 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The present invention generally relates to financial transactions and more particularly to a passphrase account identifier for use in a financial network.

In direct face to face or online financial transactions customers search for and purchase products and services from a merchant. In the case of online shopping transactions are conducted through electronic communications with online merchants over electronic networks such as the Internet. During the course of these transactions customers may provide payment in various ways including for example credit cards electronic fund transfers and other payment techniques offered by payment providers.

Typically when online shopping at a particular website customers select items to purchase by clicking on a link for a specific item. When done shopping the customer proceeds to a checkout page to provide some form of payment information such as credit card information for the selected items.

Similarly during checkout in a face to face transaction the customer is typically required to provide some form of payment information such as credit card information for the selected items. As the customer continues shopping and is ready to purchase items from another merchant websites or from other merchants directly the process of providing payment information such as credit card information to complete the purchase transaction is repeated.

In this regard multiple funding instruments including credit cards such as merchant specific credit cards as well as credit cards to satisfy a variety of accounting purposes including one or more cards for business related purchases and one or more cards for personal related purchases may be carried by the customer. Accordingly the necessity to retrieve a particular card is often cumbersome and inconvenient while trying to remember and recall the sixteen digit credit card number so that the card number and its associated credit card may be verified and authorized is extremely difficult and more often than not results in an error in card authorization as the card numbers are not accurately recalled and communicated to the merchant system.

Accordingly there exits a need for a passphrase account identifier for use as a funding instrument number substitute in a financial network.

For purposes of summarizing the disclosure exemplary embodiments of a system and method for facilitating a financial transaction over a network including a passphrase account identifier have been described herein.

In one embodiment a system for facilitating a financial transaction over a network comprises a communication interface and a payment provider system configured to receive via the communication interface a passphrase account identifier from a merchant system match the passphrase account identifier to a corresponding funding instrument number of a corresponding funding instrument and associated funding instrument account authorize the funding instrument and indicate notification of one of acceptance of the funding instrument or decline of the funding instrument back to the merchant system.

In another embodiment a system for facilitating a financial transaction over a network comprises a communication interface and a payment provider system configured to receive via the communication interface a passphrase account identifier from a merchant system match the passphrase account identifier to a corresponding funding instrument number of a corresponding funding instrument communicated the corresponding funding instrument number to an issuer system receive from the issuer system a notification indication of one of acceptance of the funding instrument or decline of the funding instrument and communicate back to the merchant system the notification indication.

In still another embodiment a method for facilitating a financial transaction over a network comprises receiving via the communication interface a passphrase account identifier from a merchant system matching the passphrase account identifier to a corresponding funding instrument number of a corresponding funding instrument and associated funding instrument account authorizing the funding instrument and indicating notification of one of acceptance of the funding instrument or decline of the funding instrument back to the merchant system.

These and other embodiments will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Embodiments of the disclosure are understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments and not for purposes of limiting the same.

Exemplary embodiments will now be described with references to the accompanying figures wherein like reference numbers refer to like elements throughout. The terminology used in the description presented herein is not intended to be interpreted in any limited or restrictive manner simply because it is being utilized in conjunction with a detailed description of certain embodiments.

Embodiments of the present disclosure are described herein as they may relate to an electronic payment system environment. An electronic payment system is generally considered as any kind of network service that includes the exchange of money for goods or services. Such network payment system includes for example card systems such as a credit and or debit card processing system for facilitating an online or web based financial transaction. However persons of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the teachings of the present disclosure apply equally to a financial transaction that occurs directly between a buyer and a merchant such as in a face to face transaction that may occur in department store or similar type business environment.

In one embodiment the network may be implemented as a single network or a combination of multiple networks. For example in various embodiments the network may include the Internet and one or more intranets landline networks wireless networks and or other appropriate types of communication networks. In another example the network may comprise a wireless telecommunications network e.g. cellular phone network adapted to communicate with other communication networks such as the Internet.

As generally shown in a network system such as a card system may include a client system also referred to as a user system herein a merchant system having a merchant provided website for the sale of goods and or services a payment provider system and a card issuer system wherein the flow of information and money between the parties in the financial transaction occurs along a network such as the Internet.

Generally in the card system a user e.g. buyer client or cardholder is issued credit after an account has been approved by an issuer system such as a financial institution bank or other organization. The issuer system registers the user issues a card s and operates a card account to which payments can be charged. The user is able to make purchases with the card for products and or services from a merchant system accepting the card up to a pre established credit limit.

For simplicity and ease of describing the subject matter the description that follows uses a credit card system as an example of a network payment system in which use of passphrase account identifier as described herein may be applicable. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will understand that other network payment systems wherein a card having a number s as an identifying feature that is used for verification authorization and other purposes may be used within the scope of the disclosure.

In a typically financial transaction the user chooses one of multiple funding instruments such as a credit card to pay for the purchase of an item product and or service and the merchant system and submits the card number for authorization either verbally or by locating and swiping the credit card at a point of sale device. The issuer system may act directly with the merchant system for credit card authorization. However as there are many issuer systems it is generally more efficient for a payment provider system to provide card services to the merchant system . In this regard the merchant system establishes a connection with the payment provider system . Connections may be made through an application programming interface API for card verification and processing. The APIs are generally HTTP or TCP IP based and provide a relatively simple interface to communicate with the merchant s application software.

In this regard the payment provider system may provide payment processing for online transactions on behalf of the user so that the user does not expose his payment information directly to the merchant system . Instead the user registers his account information with the payment provider system maps the account to an email address and then uses the payment provider system to make purchases when redirected to the payment provider system from the merchant s site . After the transaction is authorized the payment provider system completes the online transaction while the user is directed back to the merchant s site to an order confirmation page.

More specifically the client system may include one or more browser applications which may be used for example to provide a user interface to permit the user to browse information available over the network one or more toolbar applications displaying a graphical user interface GUI in connection with the browser application to provide client side processing for performing tasks in response to operations selected by the user and a service application comprising a software program for facilitating financial transactions e.g. the direct purchase of items products and or services on the network .

The service application typically comprises a software program such as the GUI executable by a processor that is configured to interface and communicate with the one or more merchant systems and the payment provider system via the network . The service application is configured to provide and display a payment mechanism such an image or icon on a display component e.g. monitor of the client system . The user is able to access merchant websites via merchant systems to view and select items for purchase by communicating with the payment provider .

The client system may include other applications as may be desired in particular embodiments to provide additional features available to the user . For example such other applications may include security applications for implementing client side security features programmatic client applications for interfacing with appropriate application programming interfaces APIs over the network or various other types of generally known programs and or applications.

The client system may include one or more user identifiers which may be implemented for example as operating system registry entries cookies associated with the browser application identifiers associated with hardware of the client system or various other appropriate identifiers. The user identifier may include attributes related to the user such as personal information and banking information including credit card number. In various implementations the user identifier may be passed with a user purchase request to the payment provider and the user identifier may be used by the payment provider to associate the user with a particular user account maintained by the payment provider .

As shown in and one or more merchant systems are maintained by merchants offering various items products and or services in exchange for financial payment or other consideration to be received from users such as user over the network . In this regard each one of the one or more merchant systems may include a database for identifying available products and or services which may be made available to the client system for viewing and purchase by the user . Accordingly each of the merchant systems may include a marketplace application configured to provide information over the network to the browser application of the client system . For example the user may interact with the marketplace application through the browser application over the network to search and view various items products and or services identified in the database .

Each of the one or more merchant systems may include a checkout application configured to accept payment information from the user and or from the payment provider system over the network to facilitate online transactions of products and or services identified by the marketplace application .

Each of the one or more merchant systems may include one or more merchant identifiers which may be included as part of the one or more items made available for purchase so that a particular item may be associated with a particular merchant . The merchant identifier may include attributes related to the merchant such as business and banking information. In various implementations the merchant identifier may be passed with a user purchase request to the payment provider system when the user selects a item for purchase and processing and the merchant identifier may be used by the payment provider system to associate a particular item purchased with a particular merchant account maintained by the payment provider system .

Each of the one or more merchants having a related merchant system may need to establish a merchant account with the payment provider system so that the payment provider system is able to process transactions having items offered for purchase by the merchants . When establishing a merchant account each of the one or more merchants may need to provide business information such as name address phone number etc. and financial information such as banking information merchant account information credit card information payment processing information etc.

Each of the one or more merchant systems may be associated with a particular link e.g. a link such as a URL Uniform Resource Locator to an IP Internet Protocol address . In this regard the payment provider system may optionally redirect the browser application to an appropriate webpage and or merchant site of the merchant system to facilitate purchase of a corresponding item made available from at least one of the merchant systems .

Each one of the merchant systems may further be configured to include and maintain a plurality of user accounts each of which may include account information associated with individual users. For example account information may include private financial information of user such as one or more account numbers passwords credit card information banking information or other types of financial information which may be used to facilitate online transactions between the user of the client system and one or more merchants systems . In various embodiments the methods and systems described herein may be modified to accommodate users that may or may not be associated with at least one existing user account and or merchant account respectively.

Alternatively as indicated above the payment provider system may provide payment processing for online transactions on behalf of the user to an operator of the merchant system . In this regard the payment provider system includes one or more payment applications which may be configured to interact with the client device and or each of the merchant systems over the network to facilitate the purchase of items by the user from the merchant systems .

The payment provider system may be configured to maintain a plurality of user and merchant accounts each of which may include account information associated with individual users and the one or more merchants associated with the merchant systems . For example account information may include private financial information of user and or merchants such as one or more account numbers passwords credit card information banking information or other types of financial information which may be used to facilitate online transactions between the user of the client system and one or more merchants associated with the merchant systems . As such the payment application may be configured to interact with the one or more merchant systems on behalf of the user during a transaction with checkout application without requiring the user to provide account information directly to the merchant systems . In various embodiments the methods and systems described herein may be modified to accommodate users and or merchants that may or may not be associated with at least one existing user account and or merchant account respectively.

As shown in in one method for conducting a client side online transaction the service application may be installed and run on the client system to allow the client system to communicate with one or more of the merchant systems via the network to select an item for purchase.

Likewise the service application allows the client system to further communicate with the payment provider system to process online purchase requests for items selected for purchase and processing in a financial transaction.

As indicated above the user may run the browser application on the client system to access at least one merchant website via a related merchant system to search the accessed merchant website and view one or more items for purchase.

The user may for example generate a purchase request for an item at the merchant s site . The purchase request may include user information merchant information and selected item information embedded as arguments in an expression that are passed to the payment provider system . The user information may include user identifier information the merchant information may include the merchant identifier information and the selected item information may include one or more image attributes including item identifier information having dynamic arguments identifying the item and the merchant providing the item.

The payment provider system receives the purchase request including credit card data from the user via the client system . Next the payment provider system verifies the user account information including user identification provided by the user in the purchase request with user information stored in payment provider system .

In this regard the payment provider system validates the card and communicates with the issuer system to verify the amount for the transaction is available in the customer s account . Alternatively as indicated above the merchant system may communicate with the issuer system to obtain credit card authorization. In either case if the card is good and the funds are available an approved notification indication or message is sent back to the merchant system . If the card is bad or if funds are not available a declined notification indication or message is sent back to the merchant system .

Once proper user identification has been provided and or verified and the funding instrument has been authorized the online purchase may be completed by deducting the amount of the purchase request from the user account and crediting the amount of the purchase request to the merchant account.

As indicated above in many financial transactions online or face to face such as those that typically occur when a merchant manages a cash register and or a point of sale POS system a user attempting to purchase an item may be carrying multiple funding instruments including credit cards such as merchant specific credit cards as well as credit cards to satisfy a variety of accounting purposes including one or more cards for business related purchases and one or more cards for personal related purchases. Accordingly the necessity to retrieve the card is often cumbersome and inconvenient while trying to remember and recall the sixteen digit credit card number so that the credit card account may be verified and authorized is extremely difficult and more often than not results in an error in card authorization as the card numbers are not accurately recalled and communicated to the merchant system.

Embodiments of the disclosure overcome the above mentioned difficulties of retrieving a credit card or remembering a credit card number by providing a passphrase account identifier as an easily remembered substitute for the sixteen digit credit card number to enable users to conduct a payment transaction in more efficient manner. Accordingly subject matter described herein permits a user to dispense with carry payments cards and the above mentioned problems generally associated with the cards by essentially providing a cardless wallet .

As indicated above in order to obtain credit i.e. receive credit approval and establish a credit card account with the issuer system and or establish a user account with the payment provider system the user is typically required to provide private financial information such as one or more account numbers passwords other credit card information banking information or other types of financial information as well as personal information such as name age residence location etc. which may be stored in the corresponding identification database and used to facilitate online transactions.

In accordance with one embodiment during the process of establishing various credit card or similar type of funding instrument accounts with either the payment provider system and or the issuer system the user is prompted to provide a passphrase account identifier as a relatively more easily remembered substitute for the sixteen digit credit card number to enable users to conduct a payment transaction in more efficient manner.

For example when establishing a Visa account with the issuer system the user may indicate that the passphrase BigSpender 4121979 indicating an easily remembered date or any alpha numerical combination that is not less than a specified minimum number of characters and not greater than specified maximum number of characters is to be used in place of the actual credit card number when completing a purchase or other type of transaction that requires credit card information to be provided by the user. For at least transaction and identification purposes the passphrase is essentially an identifier used by the payment provider system and or issuer system to identify the user s credit card number . In a similar manner a passphrase account identifier may be assigned or designated by the user for each credit card number. Accordingly instead of attempting to recall or remember the sixteen digits of one or more credit cards the user is only required to recall or remember a relatively simple and more familiar personal passphrase account identifier .

At the time of online checkout i.e. purchase of item verification and authorization of credit etc. the user in lieu of the credit card number provides the merchant system with the passphrase account identifier chosen by the user to represent the credit card number corresponding to a particular credit card account.

Once received by merchant system the passphrase account identifier may be communicated as indicated by reference A via the network to the issuer system where the passphrase account identifier is matched to user information including the corresponding credit card number and the associated credit card account . In one embodiment as encryption and decryption techniques and or technology is not required the process of matching passphrase account identifier to the corresponding credit card number and its associated account is not unlike matching of any other data related to the user and various account information. Once the credit card number is retrieved the associated credit card account may be verified and authorized for acceptance or decline by the issuer system the result of which are then communicated back to the merchant system so that the purchase transaction may be completed.

Likewise persons of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the payment provider system may maintain various credit accounts such that once the passphrase account identifier is received by the payment provider system via the network the passphrase account identifier may be matched to a corresponding credit card number and its associated credit account to facilitate acceptance or decline of the credit transaction by the payment provider system .

In an alternative embodiment shown in the user proceeds to online checkout i.e. purchase of item verification and authorization of credit etc. where once again the user in lieu of the credit card number provides the merchant system with the passphrase account identifier chosen by the user to represent a credit card number corresponding to a particular credit card account.

Once received by merchant system the passphrase account identifier may be communicated as indicated by reference B via the network to the payment provider system where the passphrase account identifier is matched to user information including the corresponding credit card number . In one embodiment once again as encryption and decryption techniques and or technology is not required the process of matching passphrase account identifier to the corresponding credit card number is not unlike matching of any other data related to the user and various account information. Once obtained by the payment provider system the credit card number may then be communicated along various network pathways to facilitate completion of the purchase transaction.

In this regard as shown in the credit card number may be communicated from the payment provider system back to the merchant system via the network . The merchant system then communicates the credit card number via the network to the issuer system where the credit card number is matched to the associated credit card account to permit verification and authorization acceptance or decline of the credit card. Acceptance or decline notification of the credit card is then communicated back to the merchant system via the network to facilitate completion of the purchase transaction.

Alternatively as shown in the credit card number is communicated from the payment provider system to the issuer system via the network where the credit card number is matched to the associated credit card account to permit verification and authorization acceptance or decline of the credit card. Acceptance or decline notification of the credit card is then communicated back to the payment provider system via the network where the notification is further communicated from the payment provider system to the merchant system to facilitate completion of the purchase transaction.

In still another network scheme as shown in the credit card number is communicated from the payment provider system to the issuer system via the network where the credit card number is matched to the associated credit card account to permit verification and authorization acceptance or decline of the credit card. Acceptance or decline notification of the credit card is then communicated back from the issuer system via the network to the merchant system to facilitate completion of the purchase transaction.

Next the user may generate a purchase request for at least one item by selecting the at least one item from the merchant s site and proceed to checkout. Methods of item selection product and or service and communication of the purchase request including user information merchant information and selected item information to the payment provider system for payment processing is generally well known in the art.

Upon selection of one or more funding instruments for the purchase of the at least one item the user is further prompted to provide to the merchant system a passphrase account identifier as a relatively more easily remembered substitute for the sixteen digit credit card number to enable users to conduct a payment transaction in more efficient manner.

Once received by merchant system the passphrase account identifier may be communicated and received via the network by the payment provider system block where the passphrase account identifier is matched to user information including the corresponding credit card number block . In this regard as encryption and decryption techniques and or technology is not required the process of matching passphrase account identifier to the corresponding credit card number is not unlike matching of any other data related to the user and various account information.

Next the credit card number is communicated from the payment provider system to the issuer system via the network block where the credit card number is matched to the associated credit card account to permit verification and authorization acceptance or decline of the credit card. Acceptance or decline notification of the credit card is then communicated back and received by the payment provider system via the network block where the notification is further communicated from the payment provider system to the merchant system block to facilitate completion of the purchase transaction.

Although described in various embodiments as not requiring the use of encryption decryption techniques and technologies persons of ordinary skill in the art will understand that in alternative embodiments all or any part of the payment network pathways described herein may employ the use of cryptosystems i.e. public and private key technology including the use of Secure Sockets Layers protocol and or Secure HTTP S HTTP protocol for transmitting information such as payment card numbers and the like over public networks such as the Internet between individuals systems etc. may be utilized without departing from the spirit of the disclosed subject matter.
