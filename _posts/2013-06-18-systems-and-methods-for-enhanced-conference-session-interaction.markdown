The present disclosure relates to presentations and more specifically to enhancing presenter and participant interactions in presentations.

In a typical CEO type audio broadcast participants are all generally muted to avoid distractions and background noise and to allow the presenter to speak uninterrupted. Participants listening in on phones computers or other device need to wait until the end of the presentation to be able to ask questions rather than asking them at the point of confusion or interest. This delay may cause participants to forget their questions or may lead to additional confusion as foundational principles upon which later points are based go misunderstood. However in commercially available web conferencing apps participants may be allowed to type their questions using a text chat. There is no mechanism available to have participants link their questions to specific charts or portions of the broadcast. Further there is no notification mechanism to the presenter that there may be a lot of questions on a specific part of the presentation which could be more efficiently addressed during the initial discussion of that specific part rather than later on in the presentation or after the main presentation. Existing conferencing solutions also do not provide an interactive way to maintain a question and answer session for offline conference recordings.

Additional features and advantages of the disclosure will be set forth in the description which follows and in part will be obvious from the description or can be learned by practice of the herein disclosed principles. The features and advantages of the disclosure can be realized and obtained by means of the instruments and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. These and other features of the disclosure will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims or can be learned by the practice of the principles set forth herein.

This framework enables participants of audio or web conferences to submit their questions at the appropriate time without disturbing the ongoing conference. Participants in audio conferences can trigger a question submission by pressing some DTMF digits or a keyboard combination on a computer or clicking a button to enable the audio conferencing system to record the question. Participants on web conferencing can click on a certain slide to ask the relevant questions either through chat or record both audio and video. The system receives the question and can link the question to a certain slide of the presentation or to a particular portion of a slide such as a chart bullet point or image. The participant device can handle receiving the question and submit it to a presentation server so the course of the conference is not disturbed. The system can then highlight these chat audio or video questions in a non intrusive manner to the speaker to address this at the opportune time. This approach also operates on recorded conferences as well as live conferences where the recordings are updated to enable participants asking questions and their corresponding responses by the presenter. Thus as additional answers and questions are contributed to a recorded conference the conference becomes a living growing conference that can be updated dynamically to take in to account new questions and new or updated answers and annotations. Users can subscribe to the recorded conference to receive notifications of the changes so that users do not need to view the entire recordings over and over again.

This approach allows participants to ask questions at the time of confusion or interest. Participants can use a chat audio or video in web conferencing to interact in a broadcast type sessions. The system can according to information provided by the presenter auto answer questions based on presenter notes or attached documents associated with the conference.

Disclosed herein are systems methods and non transitory computer readable storage media for enhancing presenter and participant interaction in a presentation. The electronic presentation can be a slide show such as a PowerPoint presentation. A system configured to practice the method can receive from a viewer of an electronic presentation a submission of a question and a selection of a communication mode for the question. The communication mode can be at least one of a text based chat audio or video or some other remote presence application. The system can identify a portion of the presentation to which the question is directed and update the portion of the electronic presentation to incorporate the question based on the communication mode. The system can update the portion of the electronic presentation by incorporating the question into at least one of a viewer interface for the electronic presentation or a presenter interface for the electronic presentation. The system can optionally notify a presenter in the electronic presentation that the portion has been updated. The presenter can provide a response to the question which the system can insert in the portion of the electronic presentation.

Various embodiments of the disclosure are discussed in detail below. While specific implementations are discussed it should be understood that this is done for illustration purposes only. A person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other components and configurations may be used without parting from the spirit and scope of the disclosure.

The presentation system disclosed herein provides a way for participants to patch an audio video or a note to a live or recorded conference with the reference to slide number or page number or to some other specific content in the conference or presentation. The system can notify the presenter in real time as the presentation is on going or offline for a previously recorded presentation. The system can notify the presenter of the details like Participant X asked a question on slide 2. The presenter can also patch the audio or a note to the conference recording while replying back to questions. The presentation system can also provide automatic replies based on moderator notes previously asked questions and corresponding answers of the same or a similar or related presentation and additional document attached in conference. Using attached documents and presenter notes the system can match keywords asked in questions and update the presentation automatically with corresponding answers or resources. The questions asked can be answered automatically just for the asker or can be provided to all of the other participants or a subset thereof. The subset can be selected based on one or more of the content of the question content of the answer the participant asking the question or the presenter. The system can also notify the presenter of automatic replies so he can change or modify the reply if necessary. In a normal audio or video conference participants can use DTMF keys to patch their audio or video questions at any time in a conference. The server can store this patch with a timestamp indicating when question was asked and send notification to the presenter. The flow charts in describe the participant and presenter or moderator work flows.

Having disclosed some basic system components and concepts the disclosure now turns to the exemplary method embodiment shown in . For the sake of clarity the method is discussed in terms of an exemplary system as shown in configured to practice the method. The steps outlined herein are exemplary and can be implemented in any combination or order thereof including combinations that exclude add or modify certain steps.

The communication mode can be at least one of a text based chat audio or video or some other remote presence application. The system can identify a portion of the presentation to which the question is directed and update the portion of the electronic presentation to incorporate the question based on the communication mode. The system can update the portion of the electronic presentation by incorporating the question into at least one of a viewer interface for the electronic presentation or a presenter interface for the electronic presentation. The system can optionally notify a presenter in the electronic presentation that the portion has been updated. The presenter can provide a response to the question which the system can insert in the portion of the electronic presentation .

A brief description of a basic general purpose system or computing device in which can be employed to practice the concepts is disclosed herein. With reference to FIG. an exemplary system includes a general purpose computing device including a processing unit CPU or processor and a system bus that couples various system components including the system memory such as read only memory ROM and random access memory RAM to the processor . The system can include a cache of high speed memory connected directly with in close proximity to or integrated as part of the processor .
