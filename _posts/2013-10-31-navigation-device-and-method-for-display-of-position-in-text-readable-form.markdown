Navigation devices were traditionally utilized mainly in the areas of vehicle use such as on cars motorcycles trucks boats etc. Alternatively if such navigation devices were portable they were further transferable between vehicles and or useable outside the vehicle for foot travel for example.

These devices are typically tailored to produce a route of travel based upon an initial position of the navigation device and a selected input travel destination end position noting that the initial position could be entered into the device but is traditionally calculated via GPS Positioning from a GPS receiver within the navigation device.

The inventors discovered that while position can be determined by a GPS receiver within the navigation device such a position is not easily recognizable by a user especially in an emergency situation where a user may need to identify his her location. Accordingly the inventors developed a method to convey to a user his her position in text readable form.

In at least one embodiment of the present application a method includes receiving a request for display of a location of a navigation device determining at least one of a last known and a current GPS location of the navigation device comparing the determined GPS location to stored map information and converting the determined GPS location into a text readable form and displaying the text readable form of the determined GPS location on an integrated input and display of the navigation device.

In at least one embodiment of the present application a navigation device includes a processor to receive a request for display of a location of a navigation device to determine at least one of a last known and a current GPS location of the navigation device to compare the determined GPS location to stored map information and to convert the determined GPS location into a text readable form and an integrated input and display device to display the text readable form of the determined GPS location.

The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the present invention. As used herein the singular forms a an and the are intended to include the plural forms as well unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms includes and or including when used in this specification specify the presence of stated features integers steps operations elements and or components but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features integers steps operations elements components and or groups thereof.

In describing example embodiments illustrated in the drawings specific terminology is employed for the sake of clarity. However the disclosure of this patent specification is not intended to be limited to the specific terminology so selected and it is to be understood that each specific element includes all technical equivalents that operate in a similar manner.

Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. As used herein the term and or includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.

Formerly known as NAVSTAR the GPS incorporates a plurality of satellites which work with the earth in extremely precise orbits. Based on these precise orbits GPS satellites can relay their location to any number of receiving units.

The GPS system is implemented when a device specially equipped to receive GPS data begins scanning radio frequencies for GPS satellite signals. Upon receiving a radio signal from a GPS satellite the device determines the precise location of that satellite via one of a plurality of different conventional methods. The device will continue scanning in most instances for signals until it has acquired at least three different satellite signals noting that position is not normally but can be determined with only two signals using other triangulation techniques . Implementing geometric triangulation the receiver utilizes the three known positions to determine its own two dimensional position relative to the satellites. This can be done in a known manner. Additionally acquiring a fourth satellite signal will allow the receiving device to calculate its three dimensional position by the same geometrical calculation in a known manner. The position and velocity data can be updated in real time on a continuous basis by an unlimited number of users.

As shown in the GPS system is denoted generally by reference numeral . A plurality of satellites are in orbit about the earth . The orbit of each satellite is not necessarily synchronous with the orbits of other satellites and in fact is likely asynchronous. A GPS receiver usable in embodiments of navigation devices of the present application is shown receiving spread spectrum GPS satellite signals from the various satellites .

The spread spectrum signals continuously transmitted from each satellite utilize a highly accurate frequency standard accomplished with an extremely accurate atomic clock. Each satellite as part of its data signal transmission transmits a data stream indicative of that particular satellite . It is appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art that the GPS receiver device generally acquires spread spectrum GPS satellite signals from at least three satellites for the GPS receiver device to calculate its two dimensional position by triangulation. Acquisition of an additional signal resulting in signals from a total of four satellites permits the GPS receiver device to calculate its three dimensional position in a known manner.

An example of such display is shown in wherein subsequent to receipt of an indication of selection of the icon of for example relating to emergency services a plurality of selectable icons may be displayed alone or along with additional information describing the category of information related to the icon for example . As shown in these icons relate to at least one of emergency service information such as the first aid guide and other guides or emergency service access including the phone for help icon the drive to help icon the walk to help icon and the where am I icon . Again each these icons are merely examples and can be varied within the context of embodiments of the present application. Further the icons may include additional text displayed therewith such as the words phone for help for example and or can include the emergency icon the life preserver for example and or can be representative of the emergency service e.g. phone for help includes phone and life preserver icons walk for help includes feet and life preserver icons etc. .

The latitude and longitude information displayed in area can be displayable in a number of variants for example selected in the application preferences. These can include for example degrees d.d minutes d m.m and seconds d m s . However display of the information in area is more involved.

Additionally the display of may include a virtual selectable button such as the phone for help button shown as element of wherein selection thereof can access display of the plurality of icons which would normally be accessible via the selection of the phone for help icon of noting that the phone for help button need not be shown unless the user selected the phone for help icon of or can merely dial an emergency number such as 911 in the United States 112 in some other countries etc. to immediately connect a user to an emergency operator upon the navigation device being paired with the navigation device via a Bluetooth or other wireless connection for example . Example of the icons which could be accessible via the selection of the phone for help icon of or the phone for help button are shown in for example and will be discussed in detail hereafter. After placing a call the where am I screen of may be displayed.

Further additional or alternative virtual buttons can be included for selection on the screen shown in such as the done button for example which can allow the user to return to a previous screen. For example if the user chooses to call a point of interest POI such as a car service hospital etc. if this POI is further than a threshold distance for example 20 km from the navigation device as determined by the processor for example an additional button Navigate there virtual button may be displayed for selection in . Selection of this button can cause processor to determine a driving route between the present GSP location of the navigation device and the POI destination. Further if the POI is determined to closer than the threshold distance 20 km for example then also a virtual button Walk there may be displayed in place of or in addition to the Navigate there button. Selection of this button can cause processor to determine a walking route between the present GSP location of the navigation device and the POI destination. Preferably the Done button is always displayed.

Additionally if the user chooses to phone a POI then the corresponding phone number may be displayed in screen of and the name of the corresponding POI may also be displayed in title area in place of the where am I of for example . If the user chooses to call a general emergency number like 911 or 112 then the title displayed may read Emergency services and the corresponding phone number may be displayed. If the user chooses to call a car service number then the title may specify the name of the car service e.g. AA Breakdown and the corresponding phone number may be displayed.

Finally the display can include an area to display the location of the user using map display information. Again this can be determined by the processor using the received GPS position signal and the stored map information of memory .

The inventors discovered that while position can be determined by a GPS receiver within the navigation device such a position is not easily recognizable by a user especially in an emergency situation where a user may need to identify his her location. Accordingly in at least one embodiment the inventors developed a method to convey to a user his her position in text readable form.

In at least one embodiment of the present application a method includes receiving a request for display of a location of a navigation device determining at least one of a last known and a current GPS location of the navigation device comparing the determined GPS location to stored map information and converting the determined GPS location into a text readable form and displaying the text readable form of the determined GPS location on an integrated input and display of the navigation device .

In at least one embodiment of the present application a navigation device includes a processor to receive a request for display of a location of a navigation device to determine at least one of a last known and a current GPS location of the navigation device to compare the determined GPS location to stored map information and to convert the determined GPS location into a text readable form and an integrated input and display device to display the text readable form of the determined GPS location.

In at least one embodiment of the present application the displayed information of further can provide the user with a description in text readable form of a GPS location of the user either last known or current . In at least one embodiment of the present application a method includes receiving a request for display of a location of a navigation device via receipt of an indication of selection of the where am I icon of for example determining a GPS location at least one of a last known and a current GPS location of the navigation device comparing via processor for example the determined GPS location to stored map information in memory for example and converting the determined GPS location into a text readable form via a plurality of programmed rules for example and displaying the text readable form of the determined GPS location on an integrated input and display device of the navigation device in area of for example.

Thus upon the processor receiving an indication of selection of the where am I button or icon displayed on the integrated input and display device as shown in for example a request for the display of the location of the navigation device is received. Further it should be understood that this display of the where am I button or icon may be done subsequent to receipt of an indication of selection of at least one previously displayed icon relating to an emergency such as the Help me icon of for example displayed on the integrated input and display device .

The conversion can include for example determining at least a roadway on which the navigation device is located and or determining at least two roadways proximate to the navigation device and or determining at least a roadway on which the navigation device is located and then determining at least one relatively nearest roadways crossing the determined roadway. Thus the displayed information in such a text readable form can include for example information such as roadways that the navigation device is currently located on current cities or villages in which the user is located and or roadways proximate to the navigation device and or crossing a roadway on which the navigation device is located. For example a processor of the navigation device can receive the aforementioned GPS information of a known or last known GPS location and can then compare that GPS information with current map information stored in the memory of the navigation device follow a plurality of programmed rules for conversion to text readable form for example and then convert the received GPS location information into text readable form for display in area of the integrated input and display device for example.

For example the processor can search the map information in memory and can attempt to determine at least a roadway on which the navigation device is located noting that all such locations are at least one of a current GPS location and a last known location . If the processor determines that the navigation device is located on a particular street road highway etc. generically referenced herein as roadway the processor can review the map information stored in memory in one direction to determine a first cross roadway x crossing the roadway on which the navigation device was determined to be located and then can review the map information stored in memory in an opposite direction to determine another cross roadway y crossing the roadway on which the navigation device was determined to be located if the user is located on a highway instead of a street the processor can similarly determine the two exits which are located on either side of the navigation device location in a similar manner . As such the processor can then determine at least one of a roadway on which the navigation device is located at least two roadways x and y proximate to the navigation device and a roadway on which the navigation device is located and at least one relatively nearest roadway crossing the determined roadway.

The processor can further calculate distances between a particular cross roadway and the determined location of the navigation device from the map information stored in memory . These distances may be rounded up so as to not overcomplicate the description e.g. 500 yards 5 miles etc. . As such this information can be displayed to the user upon selection of the where am I button in the display area wherein the selection of the where am I button can be the request to the processor for display of a location of the navigation device .

The conversion of a received GPS location into a text readable form for display in area can be done by the processor of the navigation device following a plurality of programmed rules for example stored in the processor or in memory for the processor .

Regarding the programmed rules which can be stored in memory for example the phrase I am on can be stored and can be determined to be used only when the processor is able to determine via the GPS position signal received and the stored map information in memory the roadway on which the navigation device is actually located. If the processor determines that the navigation device is not on a roadway but can determine a roadway z near or proximate to the navigation device the rules can dictate that another phrase I am near z for example can be used. If navigation device is determined by the processor comparing the received GPS location to the stored map information to be at a crossing or corner location where two roadways a and b meet the rules can dictate that another phrase the phrase I am at the corner of street a and street b can be used. As such the processor can choose from a plurality of ways to begin the conversion of received GPS location information into a text readable form to be displayed in area of display and it should be noted that the definition of rules can be broadened according to the navigation device capabilities.

Further if the processor determines that a GPS location of the navigation device cannot be determined the device can determine a last previously known GPS location. In this case instead of displaying I am . . . the rules may dictate that the processor display the words I was . . . . Further the number of minutes can also be displayed relating to the last time GPS information was received as determined by the processor from a difference of a last logged GPS signal receipt and a current time for example . Thus the display can read for example I was at the corner of roadway 1 city and roadway 2 x minutes ago. In total a plurality of predefined descriptions and rules can be stored in memory for access and or use by the processor .

As an additional example when a navigation device is in an urbanized area and not on a highway a first type of description may be used such as I am on roadway house number in city state for example I am on 450 Golden Gate Avenue in San Francisco Calif. When the navigation device is on the highway another type of description can be used such as I am on the highway road name between city navigation device has recently passed close to current position and city the user is heading close to current position close to exit exit number in state province for example I am on the A2 E35 between Utrecht and Breukelen 600 meters to exit Breukelen Exit Number 5 in province Utrecht.

Finally the programmed rules can also include an option to describe the location of the navigation device based upon proximity to a POI location. For example the processor can match the location not just against stored map information but also against POI locations. The output can be for example I am next to the Central Train Station if the navigation device is determined to be within a threshold distance of a POI such as the Central Train Station for example. This can be displayed in place of or subsequent with a roadway location.

Further it should be noted that the display of the where am I location can also involve for example an audible output. This can be done by the processor operating in conjunction with a text to speech TTS module for example. The language of output may be linked to a language selected by a user of the navigation device and or a language of a home country of the user.
