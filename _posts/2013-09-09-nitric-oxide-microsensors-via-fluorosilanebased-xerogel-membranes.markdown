This invention was made with U.S. Government support from National Institutes of Health Grant Number EB000708. Thus the U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.

The presently disclosed subject matter relates to sensors comprising a gas permeable membrane comprising alkyl and fluorinated alkyl groups. The sensors can be used as biosensors for the detection and measurement of biologically relevant gaseous species including nitric oxide and oxygen. Also provided are methods for making the sensors methods of measuring an amount of a gaseous species in a sample and compositions comprising polysiloxane networks having alkyl and fluorinated alkyl substituents.

Nitric oxide NO is a diatomic free radical endogenously synthesized in the human body when L arginine is converted to L citrulline by a class of enzymes known as nitric oxide synthases NOS s . Since the first reports describing NO s action as an endothelium derived relaxation factor much research has been devoted to elucidating the pathways of NO generation and action in biological milieu. In particular NO is involved in neurotransmission vasodilation immune responses including anti tumor and anti microbial activities the inhibition of platelet aggregation and in blood pressure control. See Zhang X. 9 3434 3446 2004 .

Miniaturized electrochemical sensors represent promising devices for determining the spatial and temporal distributions of NO in physiology. The use of such sensors however has been limited by low sensitivity comparatively slow response time and or interferences from other readily oxidizable biological species e.g. nitrite ascorbic acid uric acid and dopamine .

In attempts to address these limitations a variety of permselective polymers have been synthesized and employed as sensor membranes. For example poly tetrafluoroethylene TEFLON E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company Wilmington Del. United States of America has proven to be a selective membrane resulting in the fabrication of nitric oxide sensors with good sensitivity. Unfortunately the poor solubility of poly tetrafluoroethylene in standard organic solvents and the intricate process required to mount or coat such films onto electrodes has hindered its utility as a membrane for fabricating microsensors including those for use in detecting and measuring nitric oxide.

Accordingly there is a need in the art for gas permeable materials for use as sensor membranes. In particular there is a need for gas permeable materials that can be synthesized using common solvents and via methods that can be readily modified to tailor the permeability and selectivity of the materials for a specific use and to easily coat a variety of sensor shapes and materials.

Thus in some embodiments the permselective or selectively permeable material or membrane is selectively permeable to nitric oxide and oxygen while not being permeable to compounds such as nitrite NO ascorbic acid uric acid acetaminophen dopamine and aqueous liquids.

In some embodiments the presently disclosed subject matter provides a polysiloxane network comprising at least one silicon atom having an alkyl group substituent and at least one silicon atom having a fluorinated alkyl group substituent wherein the fluorinated alkyl group has the structure 

In some embodiments the polysiloxane network is selectively permeable to a biologically relevant gaseous species for example to nitric oxide and or oxygen O .

In some embodiments the polysiloxane network is a co condensed product of a silane mixture comprising an alkylalkoxysilane and a fluorosilane.

each X is independently selected from the group consisting of alkoxy aryloxy aralkoxy hydroxyl and halo and

Thus the fluorosilane can comprise a fluorinated alkyl group and at least one hydrolyzable group that can take place in a condensation reaction. The silicon atom of the fluorosilane can also be attached to one or two non fluorinated non hydrolyzable groups. In some embodiments p is 2 and the fluorosilane can comprise two X groups and one Y group. In some embodiments p is 1 and the fluorosilane can comprise one X group and two Y groups.

In some embodiments each of the silicon atom substituents of the fluorosilane is either a fluorinated alkyl group or a hydrolyzable group. Thus in some embodiments p is 3 and the fluorosilane can have the formula FC CF CH Si X .

In some embodiments each X is independently alkoxy or halo. For in example each X can be ethoxy methoxy or chloro. In some embodiments each Y is alkyl.

In some embodiments the alkylalkoxysilane is selected from the group consisting of methyltrimethoxysilane MTMOS ethyltrimethoxysilane propyltrimethoxysilane butyltrimethoxysilane BTMOS hexyltrimethoxysilane HTMOS octyltrimethoxysilane OTMOS and combinations thereof.

In some embodiments the silane mixture comprises about 1 to about 99 by volume fluorosilane. In some embodiments the silane mixture comprises about 5 to about 50 by volume fluorosilane. In some embodiments the silane mixture comprises about 20 by volume fluorosilane. In some embodiments the silane mixture comprises about 20 by volume heptadecafluoro 1 1 2 2 tetrahydrodecyl triethoxysilane and about 80 by volume methyltrimethoxysilane.

In some embodiments the polysiloxane network is a xerogel formed using a sol gel polymerization process. In a sol gel process precursors of the polysiloxane network e.g. the alkylalkoxysilane and the fluorosilane are present in a solution. For example the precursors can be dissolved in a solvent. The solvent can comprise water and an alcohol such as ethanol methanol propanol and the like. As polymerization proceeds the precursors bond to one another forming a macromolecule i.e. a gel .

The sol gel process of forming the polysiloxane network can involve two types of chemical reactions. The first step involves a hydrolysis reaction in which an alkoxy or chloro group of an alkylalkoxysilane and or a fluorosilane is hydrolyzed thereby forming a silanol group i.e. a hydroxy group attached to the Si atom . The hydrolysis reaction can be catalyzed by Bronstead acids or bases i.e. groups that generate H or OH ions such as for example acetic acid or hydrochloric acid. The second step is a condensation reaction wherein two silanols or a silanol and an alkoxysilane react to form a siloxane bond i.e. Si O Si while releasing a molecule of water or a molecule of an alcohol.

The presently disclosed fluorosilane based materials can be analyzed using solid state Si NMR using surface wettability measurements and using electrochemical techniques to monitor changes in the chemical structure of the xerogel as a function of precursor composition and processing conditions.

For example the level of co condensation in the polymeric silane based network can be monitored using solid state Si NMR by assessing changes in relative amounts of NMR peaks associated with three different types of silyl group which are illustrated below in Scheme 1. One type of silyl group comprises two hydroxyl groups structure A in Scheme 1 one R group i.e. an alkyl or fluorinated alkyl group and is attached to the co condensed silicone network via one siloxane bond as indicated by the wavy line . A second type of silyl group comprises one hydroxyl group one R group and has two attachment sites to the network structure B . A third type of silyl group structure C comprises three attachment sites to the network and one R group.

Xerogel stability to various potential use conditions can also be tested. For instance a xerogel membrane can be soaked in a solution at a given pH or temperature for a period of time and the Si concentration in the solution can be measured e.g. using direct current plasma optical emission spectroscopy to determine the amount of membrane fragmentation. The xerogels can also be tested to determine their permselectivity to particular gaseous or non gaseous species of interest. In certain embodiments it can be desirable to determine the biocompatibility of the presently disclosed fluorosilane based xerogel membranes depending upon the desired end use of the membranes or the devices prepared with the membranes. Thus in some embodiments the xerogel can be tested to determine its immunogenicity and or its affinity for antibodies proteins and or other biological components that can be present in mammalian cells tissues or fluids.

For example when the presently disclosed fluorosilane based xerogel membranes are to be in contact with blood e.g. in intravenous use it can be desirable to assess and or tailor the thromboresistivity of the membranes. In some embodiments thromboresistivity can be assessed according to the membrane s ability to resist platelet adhesion using an in vitro platelet adhesion assay. Marxer S. M. et al. Analyst 130 206 212 2005 . Factors that can change from xerogel to xerogel such as wettability and surface roughness are believed to be able to affect membrane thromboresistivity. See Marxer S. M. et al. Analyst 130 206 212 2005 . Surface wettability of a membrane can be determined by measuring the water contact angles of a membrane for instance before and after exposure to water for one or more periods of time. Surface roughness can be assessed via microscopy such as atomic force microscopy or any other suitable microscopy method. See Marxer S. M. et al. Analyst 130 206 212 2005 .

The presently disclosed subject matter provides sensors comprising gas permeable membranes comprising polysiloxane networks. The polysiloxane networks comprise both alkyl and fluorinated alkyl groups.

Generally the presently disclosed sensors can detect the presence of the gaseous species using an electrochemical technique such as a voltammetric or coulometric technique. In some embodiments the sensor is an amperometric sensor i.e. it detects the redox current produced by the oxidation of the gaseous species over time at a fixed voltage potential . In some embodiments the detector is a potentiostat.

Thus in some embodiments the presently disclosed subject matter provides a sensor for measuring an amount of a gaseous species in a sample the sensor comprising 

 b a gas permeable membrane located between one or more surfaces of the electrode assembly and the sample wherein the membrane comprises a polysiloxane network wherein one or more silicon atoms in the polysiloxane network is covalently attached to an alkyl group and one or more silicon atoms in the polysiloxane network is covalently attached to a fluorinated alkyl group and

In some embodiments the gaseous species is selected from nitric oxide and oxygen. In some embodiments the membrane is selectively permeable to one or more of nitric oxide and oxygen. Thus in some embodiments the presently disclosed sensors comprise membranes that are macro or meso porous and allow some molecules to pass into or through the membrane. Other molecules cannot pass through the membrane because of their size or because of electrostatic repulsion with the membrane material. In particular without being bound to any one particular theory because the presently described polysiloxane network membranes are composed of silanes having non hydrophilic substituents i.e. alkyl or fluorinated alkyl groups in some embodiments the networks are selectively permeable to neutral molecules e.g. NO and O in comparison with charged species e.g. nitrite NO .

The electrode assembly can comprise one two three or more electrodes. In some embodiments the electrode assembly comprises one electrode i.e. a working electrode . In some embodiments the sensor includes a two or a three electrode configuration. Thus in some embodiments the electrode assembly comprises a working electrode and a reference electrode. In some embodiments the electrode assembly comprises a working electrode a counter electrode and a reference electrode.

The electrode assembly can further include one or more insulating materials or components to physically contain at least a portion of the electrode or electrodes or to insulate electrodes from one another. In some embodiments the electrode assembly can comprise a coating to protect the electrode or electrodes from the environment and or to enhance the biocompatibility of the electrode assembly.

The dimensions of the sensor can be varied to suit a particular use. The presently disclosed sensors include microsensors having a sensor tip i.e. an area where the membrane coated electrode assembly is exposed to the sample with a diameter of between about 1 m and about 1 mm. In some embodiments the microsensor has a sensor tip diameter of 1 m or less. Microsensors having a sensor tip diameter of about 10 m can also be referred to as ultramicrosensors. The presently disclosed sensors also include macrosensors having a sensor tip diameter of about 1 10 mm.

The sensors can be flexible or rigid. In some embodiments the sensors can include both rigid and flexible components. The inclusion of a flexible component can be based upon the desired end use of the sensor. For example flexible components can be advantageous in the positioning retrieval and or use of a sensor in vivo.

In some embodiments the polysiloxane network is a condensation product of a silane mixture comprising an alkylalkoxysilane and a fluorosilane. The chemical structure and the relative amounts of the silanes in the silane mixture can be varied to alter the biocompatibility surface wettability and porosity characteristics of the polysiloxane network depending upon the intended use of the sensor.

In some embodiments the sensor can further comprise an internal electrolyte layer located between the electrode assembly or a portion of the electrode assembly and the gas permeable membrane. In some embodiments the internal electrolyte layer is a hydrogel composition. Suitable hydrogels include hydrogels used in medical electrodes such as but not limited to hydrogel compositions comprising polyethylene glycol PEG polyacrylamides poly 2 arylamido 2 methyl 1 propanesulfonic acid polyAMPS and polyvinylpyrrolidone. In some embodiments the hydrogel composition comprises polyvinylpyrrolidone.

In some embodiments the sensor can be a Clark type sensor including a working electrode and a reference electrode each electrode inserted into a separate barrel of a glass capillary tube. Suitable glass capillary tubes are available for example from World Precision Instruments Sarasota Fla. United States of America . At the end of the capillary tube the ends of the electrodes are exposed from the glass and are covered by the gas permeable membrane.

In some embodiments the presently disclosed subject matter provides a method of making a sensor for measuring an amount of a gaseous species in a sample the method comprising 

 c coating at least one portion of the electrode assembly with the silane mixture to form a coated electrode and

 d drying the coated electrode to form a gas permeable polysiloxane membrane layer on at least one portion of the electrode assembly.

In some embodiments the silane mixture is dissolved in a solvent. In some embodiments the solvent comprises an alcohol and water. In some embodiments the solvent comprises a catalyst such as a Bronstead acid or base. In some embodiments the catalyst is hydrochloric acid. Thus in some embodiments sol gel chemistry techniques such as described hereinabove provide readily useable methods for macro and microsensor fabrication as well as flexibility in optimizing the analytical response characteristics of the sensor.

The electrode assembly can comprise one two three or more electrodes. In some embodiments the electrode assembly comprises one electrode i.e. a working electrode . In some embodiments the sensor includes a two or a three electrode configuration. Thus in some embodiments the electrode assembly comprises a working electrode and a reference electrode.

In some embodiments the single metal wire microelectrode or ultramicroelectrode comprises platinized platinum or a platinized platinum tungsten wire.

During the drying process the solvent can be evaporated. Some drying conditions can also be used to reduce the porosity of the membrane by leading to additional condensation of any remaining alkoxy and or hydroxy groups in the network. Thus in addition to varying the composition of the polysiloxane e.g. ratio or the chemical composition of the alkylalkoxysilane and the fluorosilane the method of drying the coated electrode assembly e.g. the curing conditions can be used to optimize the sensitivity and selectivity of the sensor.

In some embodiments the coated electrode assembly can be dried by exposure to ambient conditions for a period of time. Drying under ambient conditions can be referred to as aging. Ambient conditions include exposure to air or dry air i.e. dessicated air at room temperature i.e. between about 20 C. and 25 C. at atmospheric pressure. The coated electrode assembly can be aged for time periods ranging from several minutes i.e. 5 min to one or more hours or to one to more days.

In some embodiments the coated electrode assembly can be cured by drying at an increased temperature i.e. by annealing . For example the coated electrode assembly can be cured at about 80 C. for a period to time such as several minutes to several hours.

Further in some embodiments the coated electrode assembly can be cured by exposure to a gas at a given pressure. For example the coated electrode assembly can be cured by exposure to a gas such as NO or argon gas at a pressure between about 1 atm and about 5 atm for a period of time.

The curing or drying step of the presently disclosed methods can include any combination of aging annealing or exposure to gas at a pressure.

The silane mixture can be coated onto the electrode assembly by any convenient method. For example an aliquot of the silane mixture can be placed onto a portion of the electrode assembly using a pipette micropipette syringe or microsyringe. Alternatively the electrode assembly can be dipped into the silane mixture or into a solution comprising the silane mixture. The coating can be done manually or using a robotic or otherwise mechanized device. The portion of the electrode assembly coated will in general include at least a portion of the working electrode.

The electrode assembly can be coated with as little as 0.02 L mmof the silane coating mixture. In some embodiments the membrane has a thickness of between about 0.1 m and about 10 m.

In some embodiments the thickness of the membrane layer can be optimized for desired permeability or selectivity characteristics. Thus in some embodiments the coating or the coating and drying steps can be repeated one or more times to achieve a thicker membrane layer.

In some embodiments the electrode assembly is coated with an internal electrolyte layer prior to being coated with the silane mixture. In some embodiments the electrolyte layer is a hydrogel composition such as for example poly vinylpyrrolidone . A hydrogel internal electrolyte layer can be formed by treating the electrode assembly with a mixture comprising 30 mM sodium chloride 0.3 mM hydrochloric acid and 1 poly vinylpyrrolidone in water pH 3.5 . For example the electrode assembly can be dipped into the poly vinylpyrrolidone mixture and dried under ambient conditions for 10 min prior to coating with the silane mixture. The thickness of such an internal electrolyte layer can be for example approximately 1.5 M.

In some embodiments the presently disclosed subject matter provides a method of measuring the amount of a gaseous species in a sample. The sample can be a biological sample or an environmental sample. In particular the presently disclosed sensors can be used to specifically and quantitatively detect a gaseous species that is dissolved in a solution such as an aqueous solution of biological media either in vitro or in vivo. Thus in some embodiments the sensor is a biosensor. In some embodiments the gas is oxygen or nitric oxide. In particular embodiments sensors provided by the presently disclosed subject matter can detect nitric oxide.

In some embodiments the sensors can detect and quantify nitric oxide or another gaseous species present in a sample at low levels for example at levels as low as about 10 nM. In some embodiments the gaseous species is present at a concentration as low as about 200 pM. For example the sensors can selectively measure a gaseous species at concentration levels between about 200 pM and about 4 M. In some embodiments the gaseous species is at a concentration of between about 200 pM and about 300 nM. In some embodiments the gaseous species is at a concentration of between about 200 pM and about 3 nM.

Thus the presently disclosed sensors include nitric oxide sensors that can be used as research tools to investigate the biological actions of NO to monitor medical conditions related to NO regulated processes and to monitor the degradation therapeutic or adverse actions of a variety of therapeutics including the actions of NO releasing therapeutics such as nitroglycerin or amyl nitrite. NO releasing therapeutics include those which release NO themselves as well as those which trigger the release of NO by the body. In some embodiments the presently disclosed sensors can be used as neurochemical research or medical diagnostic tools.

In some embodiments the biological sample in which the gas is being measured is one of a cell a tissue an organ or a biological fluid. Cells can include for example heart cells brain cells macrophage cells neutrophil cells monocyte cells and endothelial cells. Biological fluids can include blood plasma gastric fluid milk saliva cerebrospinal fluid CSF and the like. Biological samples can also include cell cultures tissue cultures and cell or tissue extracts.

In some embodiments the sensors can be used to measure NO in the brain or in a brain cell or brain tissue. In some embodiments the sensors can be used to measure NO levels in blood for example in a blood vessel. In some embodiments the sensors can be used to determine an immune response by measuring NO in a macrophage cell a neutrophil cell or in tissue comprising or believed to comprise a macrophage and or neutrophil cell. In some embodiments the sensors can be used to measure the NO concentration in a single cell.

In some embodiments the methods of the presently disclosed subject matter can be useful for measuring the concentration of nitric oxide or another biologically relevant gaseous species in a biological sample derived from or present in a subject. In some embodiments the subject is a human subject although it is to be understood that the subject can be any living organism including microbes plants and animals.

Accordingly the term subject as used herein refers to any invertebrate or vertebrate species. The methods and sensors of the presently disclosed subject matter are particularly useful as diagnostic and research tools for use with samples from warm blooded vertebrates. Thus the presently disclosed subject matter concerns mammals and birds. More particularly herein provided are methods for the study and or diagnosis of mammals such as humans as well as those mammals of importance due to being endangered such as Siberian tigers of economical importance animals raised on farms for consumption by humans and or social importance animals kept as pets or in zoos to humans for instance carnivores other than humans such as cats and dogs swine pigs hogs and wild boars ruminants such as cattle oxen sheep giraffes deer goats bison and camels and horses. Also provided is the study and diagnosis of birds including those kinds of birds that are endangered kept in zoos as well as fowl and more particularly domesticated fowl e.g. poultry such as turkeys chickens ducks geese guinea fowl and the like as they also are of economical importance to humans. Thus subjects include livestock including but not limited to domesticated swine pigs and hogs ruminants horses poultry and the like. Subjects also include animals generally used in biological or medical research such as rodents e.g. rats mice and hamsters and primates.

In some embodiments the sample is derived from but is no longer present in a living subject. Thus in some embodiments NO can be measured in a sample ex vivo. In some embodiments the sample is present in a living subject and NO concentration can be measured in a sample in vivo. In some embodiments the sample is an environmental sample such as an air sample or a water sample taken from for example a lake a river a stream a pond or any other outdoor water source. Thus for example the presently disclosed sensors can be used to measure NO levels in air produced for example as waste from combustion engines or power plants. The sensors can also be used to quantitate levels of dissolved NO or Oin aquatic environments to assess the ability of such environments to sustain animal or plant life.

United States of America .

Xerogel casting solutions were prepared by mixing 40 L of MTMOS Aldrich Milwaukee Wis. United States of America and 10 L of fluorosilane either 3 3 3 trifluoropropyl trimethoxysilane 3FTMS nonafluorohexyltrimethoxysilane 9FTMS tridecafluoro 1 1 2 2 tetrahydro octyl trimethoxysilane 13FTMS or heptadecafluoro 1 1 2 2 tetrahydrodecyl trimethoxysilane 17FTMS with 200 L ethanol EtOH and 100 L water for 10 min. The synthesis of the xerogel was catalyzed by the addition of 10 L of 0.5 M HCl. The solution was then deposited onto a platinized platinum working macroelectrode platinized with a platinizing solution of 3 chloroplatinic acid and 0.1 lead acetate in water .

The permeability of the cured xerogels to NO and nitrite NO were evaluated electrochemically according to previously described procedures by measuring the ratio of peak currents at the xerogel coated and bare Pt electrodes in 10 M NO and 100 M nitrite solutions. See Shin J. H. et al. 77 3494 3501 2005 . The selectivity of the xerogel modified sensors for NO in the presence of nitrite was determined using the separation solution method also according to previously described procedures. See Shin J.

The results of the permeability and selectivity testing are shown in . As indicated by the bar medium gray graph portion of the xerogels comprising 3FTMS and 17FTMS had the highest NO permeability. As indicated by the scatter graph light colored squares portion of xerogels comprising 17FTMS were most effective at discriminating NO over NO under the noted conditions.

A casting solution was prepared by mixing 40 L of MTMOS Aldrich Milwaukee Wis. United States of America and 10 L Heptadeca fluoro 1 1 2 2 tetrahydrodecyl triethoxysilane Gelest Tullytown Pa. United States of America with 200 L ethanol EtOH and 100 L water for 10 min. The synthesis of the xerogel was catalyzed by the addition of 10 L of 0.5 M HCl. The solution was then deposited onto a platinized platinum working microelectrode platinized with a platinizing solution of 3 chloroplatinic acid and 0.1 lead acetate in water .

After curing NO response and calibration curves for the xerogel modified microelectrode were obtained by injecting aliquots of a standard NO solution 1.9 mM into 100 mL phosphate buffered saline PBS pH 7.4 at room temperature under constant stirring. Amperometric measurements were performed using a CH Instruments 660A potentiostat CH Instruments Inc. Austin Tex. United States of America .

The biocompatibility of the presently disclosed fluorosilane based xerogel membranes was determined by assessing the membranes ability to resist platelet adhesion. Platelet adhesion resistance was determined according to previously disclosed methods. See Marxer S. M. et al. Analyst 130 206 212 2005 .

More particularly acid citrate dextrose ACD anticoagulated porcine blood 3 parts ACD to 20 parts whole blood was centrifuged at 200 g for 30 min at room temperature to obtain platelet rich plasma PRP . Calcium chloride was added to the PRP to a final concentration of 0.25 0.50 mM Ca to maintain normal platelet activity. Fluorosilane based xerogel membrane coated glass slides were immersed in the PRP for 1 hour at 37 C. in a humid environment. The slides were rinsed with Tyrode s buffer pH 7.4 to remove loosely adhered platelets. The attached platelets were then fixed with a 1 glutaraldehyde solution v v Tyrode s buffer for 30 min. The slides were rinsed with Tyrode s buffer and water and chemically dried by immersion in 50 75 and 95 ethanol v v water for 5 min each followed by immersion in 100 ethanol for 10 minutes and finally in hexamethyldisilazane for about 12 hours.

Phase contrast images of the slides were obtained using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc. Chester Va. United States of America . The amount of platelet adhesion on the xerogel membrane coated slides was compared relative to that of non coated glass slides. The relative platelet adhesion of a fluorosilane based xerogel membrane coated glass slide prepared from a casting solution comprising a silane mixture of 20 by volume heptadecafluoro 1 1 2 2 tetrahydrodecyl triethoxysilane and 80 by volume MTMOS is shown in right hand bar indicated by 17FTMS .
