Some embodiments relate to master data management. More specifically some embodiments provide systems and methods for providing mast data management statistics.

A business or enterprise may store information about various items in the form of electronic records. For example a company might have an employee database where each row in the database represents a record containing information about a particular employee e.g. the employee s name date of hire and salary . Moreover different electronic records may actually be related to a single item. For example a human resources database and a sales representative database might both contain records about the same employee. In some cases it may be desirable to consolidate multiple records to create a single data store that contains a single electronic record for each item represented in the database. Such a goal might be associated with for example an automated master data management application and or a data steward that attempt to automatically recognize or match these records to create a correct master data store. Advantages associated with creating such a master data store might include increased efficiency through the enterprise and or improved customer service. For example when a sales representative retrieves a customer record the master data store might include contact information that would have been missing if information from multiple sources were not correctly matched and merged.

The consolidation process in a master data management program can be a relatively time consuming and or expensive task especially when a substantial number of records e.g. millions of records and or input data sources are involved. It can be difficult however to determine the advantages created by the master data management program. For example an enterprise might be unsure if it should devote the employee hours and or costs associated with a master data management program without understanding the benefits it will provide.

Accordingly methods and mechanisms for accurately and efficiently demonstrating the results of a master data management program may be desired.

A master data management platform may receive input records from the various data stores . For example the master data management platform might import the input records from a remote data store via HyperText Transport Protocol HTTP communication or any other type of data exchange. The master data management platform and or data stores might be associated with for example Personal Computers PCs servers and or mobile devices.

The master data management platform may consolidate and or merge the input records received from the data stores and store master records into a master data store in accordance with any of the embodiments described herein. For example a human resources database and a sales representative database might both contain records about the same employee. In this case the master data management platform might automatically consolidate the multiple records to create a single master record for that employee and the master record might include information from both systems . Such a goal might be associated with for example a master data management program.

According to some embodiments a consolidation of records in master data management is associated with a two phase process of i identifying potential duplicates and then ii merging the records into a single best representative instance of the record. Note that large sets of data might be extracted from multiple legacy systems into the master data management platform and include some obvious straight forward duplicates that need to and can be resolved and merged immediately after the data is imported into the master data management platform . In many cases the duplicate detection will be straight forward such as when it is based on a well defined identifier that can t be interpreted in ambiguous ways. Examples of such identifiers include a Social Security Number for to identify individuals or a Global Trade Item Number GTIN to detect duplicate materials.

In some cases however duplicate records may need to be merged into a single physical record but conflicting data values exist among the different records. For example one record might indicate a home address of 123 Main Street while another record indicates a home address of 12 Main Street. A rule based mechanism may facilitate consolidation in any conflict situation and this logic may comprise a set of rules that automate and streamline the consolidation process in master data management. After the records are merged an administrator or data steward may interact with a Graphical User Interface to create displays and or reports in accordance with any of the embodiments described herein.

Note that represents a logical architecture according to some embodiments and actual implementations may include more or different components arranged in other manners. Moreover each system described herein may be implemented by any number of devices in communication via any number of other public and or private networks. Two or more of devices of may be located remote from one another and may communicate with one another via any known manner of network s and or a dedicated connection. Further each device may comprise any number of hardware and or software elements suitable to provide the functions described herein as well as any other functions. Other topologies may be used in conjunction with other embodiments.

All systems and processes discussed herein may be embodied in program code stored on one or more computer readable media. Such media may include for example a floppy disk a CD ROM a DVD ROM a Zip disk magnetic tape and solid state Random Access Memory RAM or Read Only Memory ROM storage units. Embodiments are therefore not limited to any specific combination of hardware and software.

The master data management platform may operate in accordance with any of the embodiments described herein. For example is a flow diagram of a process according to some embodiments. Note that all processes described herein may be executed by any combination of hardware and or software. The processes may be embodied in program code stored on a tangible medium and executable by a computer to provide the functions described herein. Further note that the flow charts described herein do not imply a fixed order to the steps and embodiments of the present invention may be practiced in any order that is practicable.

At S a plurality of input records may be received over a period of time from a plurality of sources. For example batches of record might be received from enterprise resource planning system and a customer relationship management system on a periodic basis.

At S master data management may be performed as the records are received i.e. during the period of time to match at least some records from different sources with each other. For example fields within each record might be used to determine that two slightly different records actually refer to the same real word object e.g. purchase order .

At S a statistics window within the period of time may be determined. For example the statistics window may be associated with a statistics start date and a statistics end date. According to some embodiments the statistics start date and the statistics end date are defined by a data steward. Other examples of a statistics window might include from Jan. 1 2010 to the present and over the last four months. 

At S at least one master data management statistics value may be calculated based on the master data management that was performed during the statistics window. Note that the calculated master data management statistics value might not be based on master data management that was performed before a statistics start date or after a statistics end date.

According to some embodiments the calculated master data management statistics value is associated with records consumed by another application. Such a value might help for example demonstrate to a budget planner how useful a master data management program is to an enterprise e.g. because the records improved by the program are frequently being used by other applications within the enterprise . As other examples the calculated master data management statistics value might be associated with source based record distribution region based record distribution record cleansing data record matching data record duplication data best record calculations and or a record refinement rate.

At S the calculated master data management statistics value may be displayed. According to some embodiments the calculated master data management statistics value is displayed to a data steward both as a numerical value and as a graphical representation.

The processor communicates with a storage device . The storage device may comprise any appropriate information storage device including combinations of magnetic storage devices e.g. a hard disk drive optical storage devices and or semiconductor memory devices. The storage device stores a program and or master data management statistics engine application for controlling the processor . The processor performs instructions of the programs and thereby operates in accordance with any of the embodiments described herein. For example the processor may receive a plurality of records over a period of time from a plurality of sources. As the records are received during the period of time master data management may be performed by the processor to match at least some records from different sources with each other. A statistics window within the period of time may be determined by the processor and at least one master data management statistics value may be calculated by the processor based on the master data management that was performed during the statistics window. The calculated master data management statistics value may then be displayed by the processor .

The programs may be stored in a compressed uncompiled and or encrypted format. The programs may furthermore include other program elements such as an operating system a database management system and or device drivers used by the processor to interface with peripheral devices.

As used herein information may be received by or transmitted to for example i the master data management apparatus from another device or ii a software application or module within the master data management apparatus from another software application module or any other source.

In some embodiments such as shown in the storage device stores master data management information and a consumption database described with respect to . One example of a consumption database that may be used in connection with the master data management apparatus will now be described in detail with respect to . Note that the databases described herein are examples and additional and or different information may be stored therein. Moreover various databases might be split or combined in accordance with any of the embodiments described herein.

Referring to a table is shown that represents the consumption database that may be stored at the master data management apparatus according to some embodiments. The table may include for example entries identifying records that have been consumed by other applications. The table may also define fields for each of the entries. The fields may according to some embodiments specify a consumption identifier an application a date and a number of records retrieved . The information in the consumption database may be automatically created and updated for example based on actions performed by other applications.

The consumption identifier may be for example an alphanumeric code associated with a particular use of information in a master data database. The application may be the name of the program or platform that requested the data and the date may indicate when the request for data was made or executed. The number of retrieved records may indicate how many records were provided to the application as a result of the request. The date and number of retrieved records may be used for example to demonstrate how useful a master data program is to various entities within an enterprise that is the entities associated with the applications .
