The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

This invention relates generally to electrochemical capacitors which operate to store electrical energy. More specifically the invention relates to electrochemical capacitors which are configured to function as structural elements of devices in which they are incorporated.

In the design of most devices consideration is given to the final size and weight of a device. For many devices there is a desire to minimize the size and or weight of the device particularly for portable electronic devices such as mobile phones and unmanned vehicles such as drones. Often the energy source for a device e.g. a battery a capacitor an electrochemical capacitor a fuel cell or a bank of such energy sources contributes a substantial portion of the size and weight of the portable device. Thus there it would be desirable to reduce the final size and or weight of the energy source or bank of energy sources that is included in devices particularly portable devices.

It has been proposed to reduce the size and weight of portable devices by making various components of such devices multifunctional. The energy source typically a battery is often one of the largest or heaviest single components in an electrical device and thus is one which would benefit most from being multifunctional. One example of multifunctionality is to add mechanical stiffness or load carrying capacity to an energy storage device. Attempts have been made to produce multifunctional batteries which contribute to the mechanical strength of a device in which the battery is included in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 594 863 filed on Nov. 9 2006 titled Structural Batteries and Components Thereof in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 735 999 filed on Nov. 9 2005 titled Structural Composite Battery and in Design and Processing of Structural Composite Batteries Proceedings of SAMPE 2007 Baltimore Md. 3 7 Jun. 2007 by James F. Snyder et al. which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. Attempts have also been made to produce multifunctional fuel cells which contribute to the mechanical strength of the device in which the fuel cells are included in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 594 861 filed on Nov. 9 2006 titled Structural Fuel Cells and Components Thereof and in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 735 991 filed on Nov. 9 2005 titled Structural Composite Fuel Cell . And attempts have also been made to produce multifunctional capacitors which contribute to the mechanical strength of the device they supply in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 594 862 filed on Nov. 9 2006 titled Structural Capacitors and Components Thereof and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 735 998 filed on Nov. 9 2005 titled Structural Capacitors . It would also be desirable to provide multifuctional electrochemical capacitors that could contribute to the mechanical strength of the device to which they supply energy to reduce the size and or weight of the device.

Structural electrochemical capacitors would be more or in addition to advantageous than structural batteries structural capacitors and structural fuel cells because electrochemical capacitors can provide higher specific power than batteries or fuel cells and higher specific energy than capacitors c.f. Ragone plot in FIG. 3 in What Are Batteries Fuel Cells and Supercapacitors Chem Rev 2004 104 4245 4269 by Martin Winter et al. . Electrochemical capacitors are particularly useful to provide rapid charge or discharge capabilities in combination with high specific energy devices such as batteries or fuel cells or energy harvesting devices such as photovoltaics. One useful application is for charge conditioning in which a structural electrochemical capacitor stores energy from other sources for load balancing purposes and provides an appropriate charge routine to a high specific energy device such as a battery. Structural electrochemical capacitors also have potential for long life theoretically up to millions of charge discharge cycles due to the relative absence of electrode swelling and interfacial degradation in comparison to devices such as batteries that may only last for hundreds or perhaps thousands of charge discharge cycles. Advantageously structural electrochemical capacitors also have little danger of overcharging a common problem with batteries.

The structural energy storage devices described herein structural electrochemical capacitors contribute both energy storage and mechanical strength to a system or device in which the electrochemical capacitors are incorporated. The mechanical strength is owing to two factors the design of matted or woven laminate electrodes based for example on activated carbon fibers and a resin or polymer electrolyte which impregnates the electrodes. The available energy density may be increased by using carbon fibers with a high surface area achieved through surface treatment or activation. Power densities greater than that obtained from batteries are realized by more rapid capacitive charge storage mechanisms such as arise from the electrical double layer at the electrode surfaces.

Batteries capacitors and electrochemical capacitors of the type used for delivery of relatively high levels of power or energy are generally fairly large bulky items and their size and weight can impose a significant design constraint on systems particularly portable systems in which they are included. Heretofore these size and weight constraints have limited the utility and practicality of particular systems. As will be described in detail herein below the present invention recognizes that by the appropriate selection of materials electrochemical capacitors may be manufactured which combine good structural properties such as strength and stiffness together with good electrical properties. Such electrochemical capacitors can be used to form structural elements of systems in which they are incorporated and hence these electrochemical capacitors are referred to herein as structural electrochemical capacitors. Since structural electrochemical capacitors function both as capacitive storage devices as well as structural components of systems the weight and or size burden imposed upon such systems by the need for capacitive storage is greatly minimized. For example portions of the air frame of an unmanned aerial vehicle or other vehicle may be fabricated from one or more structural electrochemical capacitors. Hence the overall weight of the vehicle will be reduced and or the amount of electrical power carried by the vehicle can be significantly increased. It will be appreciated that similar power weight size benefits will be achieved with regard to other devices such as cellular telephones other communications equipment computers microsystems and specialized electronic devices and systems. In such devices the structural electrochemical capacitors of the present invention can function as circuit boards housings casings protective members and so forth. Further details and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the drawings discussion and description which follow.

Disclosed herein is a structural electrochemical capacitor that is designed and adapted to be used as a structural element in a device in which the electrochemical capacitor is incorporated. The includes structural electrochemical capacitor at least one pair of electrodes e.g. an anode and a cathode and a solid electrolyte where the combined anode cathode and solid electrolyte forms a rigid unit and the rigid unit that consists essentially of the anode the cathode and the solid electrolyte has a compressive stiffness of at least about 10 MPa. In certain embodiments the rigid unit that consists essentially of the anode the cathode and the solid electrolyte has a compressive stiffness of at least 100 MPa. Desirably the electrochemical capacitor stores and releases energy at an energy density of at least about 1 nJ g. And in certain embodiments the anode the cathode and the solid electrolyte material account for a majority of the mass of the structural element or a majority of the volume of the structural element.

In one particular embodiment the present invention provides an electrochemical capacitor used as a structural element in a device in which the electrochemical capacitor is incorporated the electrochemical capacitor including but not limited to an anode a cathode and a solid polymer electrolyte that comprises from about 25 weight percent comb units to about 75 weight percent comb units is a solid at room temperature has a stiffness of at least 1 MPa and has an ionic conductivity of at least 10S cm where the combined anode cathode and solid electrolyte forms a rigid unit and the rigid unit that consists essentially of the anode the cathode and the solid electrolyte collectively possesses a compressive stiffness of at least 10 MPa and a failure strength of at least 1 MPa.

The present invention also provides a method of capacitively storing electrical energy and conserving mass and or volume in a device the method including the steps of fabricating portions of the structure of a device with high strength structural electrochemical capacitor comprising at least one pair of electrodes and a body of solid electrolytic material disposed between said electrodes wherein the body of solid electrolytic material accounts for a majority of the mass of a structural element or a majority of the volume of a structural element in the device where the combination consisting of said electrodes and said body of electrolytic material has a stiffness of at least about 10 MPa in a compression loading mode.

The present invention provides structural electrochemical capacitors also sometimes referred to and include supercapacitors ultracapacitors electric double layer capacitors electrochemical double layer capacitors EDLCs and so called pseudocapacitors and asymmetric capacitors that rely on Faradaic processes where the structural electrochemical capacitors include one or more active components that have sufficient strength and rigidity to allow the electrochemical capacitors to function as structural elements in various constructions and devices. As used herein the term electrochemical capacitor is meant to include ultracapacitors supercapacitors and hybrid asymmetric capacitors as described in What Are Batteries Fuel Cells and Supercapacitors Chem Rev 2004 104 4245 4269 by Martin Winter et al. which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.

The structural electrochemical capacitors of the present invention operate to store and release electrical energy and simultaneously function as a structural element in a device into which the structural electrochemical capacitor is incorporated and will include at least one anode one cathode and a body of electrolyte material disposed there between. In many embodiments the electrolytic material is a solid and accounts for a majority of the mass and or the volume of the structural element. The anode and cathode will both be referred to herein as electrodes. 

It is a feature of the present invention that an electrochemical capacitor of the present invention carries a structural load while simultaneously storing electrochemical energy such that the at least one pair of electrodes and the electrolytic material taken in combination have a stiffness which is at least about 10 MPa as measured by ASTM D 3039 Tensile Properties of Polymer Matrix Composites and releases energy at an energy density of at least about 1 nJ g. Desirably a structural electrochemical capacitor of the present invention releases energy at an energy density of at least about 1 J g and more desirably releases energy at an energy density of at least about 1 mJ g. In specific embodiments the at least one pair of electrodes and the electrolytic material taken in combination have a stiffness between about 10 MPa and about 1000 GPa in a tension loading mode a compression loading mode a shear loading mode a bending loading mode and or in a torsion loading mode and in some embodiments between about 50 MPa and about 100 GPa in a tension loading mode a compression loading mode a shear loading mode a bending loading mode and or in a torsion loading mode as measured in accord with conventional practices well known in the engineering arts for example ASTM D3039 D3039M 08 for tensile stiffness ASTM D6641 D6641M 09 for compressive stiffness ASTM D5379 D5379M 05 for shear loading stiffness ASTM D6272 10 for bending loading stiffness and ASTM D1043 10 for torsion loading stiffness.

In addition to the foregoing the failure strength of the combination of the at least one pair of electrodes and electrolytic material is generally at least about 1 MPa in a tension loading mode a compression loading mode a shear loading mode a bending loading mode and or in a torsion loading mode and more desirably at least about 10 MPa in a tension loading mode a compression loading mode a shear loading mode a bending loading mode and or in a torsion loading mode. In certain instances the failure strength of the combination of the at least one pair of electrodes and electrolytic material is between about 1 MPa and about 10 GPa and is in some instances between about 10 MPa and about 1 GPa as measured by ASTM D3039 08. In some typical applications the energy density of the present electrochemical capacitors is at least 1 nJ g 3 10Wh kg in other instances at least 1 J g 3 10Wh kg and may achieve more than 50 J g 14 Wh kg using commercially available materials utilizing the electric double layer effect and over 100 J g for asymmetric devices incorporating Faradaic processes. In certain embodiments the at least one pair of electrodes and the body of solid electrolytic material have a capacitance of at least 1 microFarads per gram of the electrodes and the body of solid electrolytic material. In certain embodiments the high strength structural electrochemical capacitor namely the at least one pair of electrodes and said body of solid electrolytic material have an ionic conductivity of at least 10S cm and in particular embodiments an ionic conductivity at least 10S cm.

The various elements of the electrochemical capacitor may differ in stiffness and failure strength however taken collectively some or all contribute to the strength and integrity of the electrochemical capacitor. In specific instances the stiffness of the electrolyte is at least about 1 MPa and the stiffness of the at least one pair of electrodes or multiple pairs of electrodes will be also at least 1 MPa. In certain desirable embodiments the present invention provides electrochemical capacitor materials with sufficient structural and energy efficiency so as to enable significant weight and or volume reductions by allowing manufacturers to replace conventional inert structural components with structural components that serve at least two functions namely structure and energy storage.

It is to be understood that the structural electrochemical capacitors of the present invention may be fabricated utilizing various electrochemical capacitor chemistries however for purposes of illustration the invention will be explained with specific reference to an exemplary electrochemical capacitor systems based on carbon electrodes and a cured vinyl ester thermoset electrolytic material that includes lithium ions and appropriate counterions although the invention is not limited to such systems. In a lithium ion electrochemical capacitor lithium ions move between a pair of electrodes through a lithium ion conductive and electron resistive electrolyte during the discharge and charge cycle of the electrochemical capacitor. The appropriate counterions typically move in the opposite direction between the pair of electrodes. The charges accumulate at the boundary between the electrode and the electrolyte in what is referred to as the electrical double layer. The amount of energy that may be stored is proportional to the surface area accessible to the ions and typically depends on the topography of the electrode surface the size and charge of the ions the extent of dissociation between cations and anions and the electrolyte solvent among other things. The ions are stored at a voltage no higher than the dissociation voltage of the electrolyte solvent which is typically less than 3V for nonaqueous media and 1V for aqueous media. It is typical for liquid solvents to be used in the electrolyte to facilitate ion transport and thus decrease internal resistance. It is also typical for electrodes to have minimal structural properties in favor of designing higher surface area. Alternative electrodes include polymers and metal oxides that can store charge by means of Faradaic processes while counterions accumulate to result in what is referred to as pseudocapacitive devices that typically have improved energy density but often lower power density relative to standard electrochemical capacitors.

Variously configured structural electrochemical capacitors may be fabricated in accordance with the present invention. depicts a cross sectional view of one such electrochemical capacitor being tested under a compressive load F while powering an electrical device for example a light . The illustrated exemplary electrochemical capacitor includes a first pair of electrodes consisting of a cathode and an anode and a second pair of electrodes consisting of a cathode and an anode which are connected via an electrical conductor for example a copper wire to form an circuit.

In certain suggested embodiments the electrodes are formed from or otherwise include of a layer of electrically conductive carbon fabric which can operate to accumulate ions in an electrical double layer. Suggested carbon fibers carbon fabrics carbon papers and other materials that may be used as electrodes include but are not limited to the materials described in Evaluation of Commercially Available Carbon Fibers Fabrics and Papers for Potential Use in Multifunctional Energy Storage Applications Journal of the Electrochemical Society 156 3 A215 A224 2009 by James F. Snyder et al. which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. A particularly suggested group of carbon fibers include but are not limited to polyacrylonitile based and pitch based fibers. Other particularly suggested carbon electrode materials include but are not limited to grapheme carbon fiber mats carbon nanotube mats and carbon nanofoam papers. In certain suggested embodiments carbon electrodes are made from an inert or carbon based fabric that is coated with polypyrrole. One particular carbon fabric that is particularly useful is SPECTRACARB 2225 fabric a lightweight activated carbon fabric that is sold by Spectracorp of Shelton Conn.

It is to be understood that electrodes of other configurations and other materials may be readily incorporated into electrochemical capacitors of this type. Such electrodes may be formed of or otherwise include surface activated carbon fibers carbon fibers or metal bodies having appropriate materials coated onto or absorbed there into as well as composite materials as is known in the art. Examples of coated materials may include high surface area carbonaceous materials such as carbon nanotubes and carbon aerogels and materials such as metal oxides and polymers that rely on Faradaic processes to store capacitive charge.

A body of a solid electrolyte material is disposed so as to impregnate the pairs of electrodes. The electrolyte is operable to conduct lithium ions between the opposing electrodes or a pair of electrodes and and and respectively. Desirably the electrodes should have at least a reasonably good lithium ion conductivity. In certain particular embodiments the lithium ion conductivity is at least 10S cm in other instances the lithium ion conductivity is at least 10S cm and in particular instances the lithium ion conductivity is at least 10S cm. In the illustrated embodiment an optional body for example a layer of polymer material and is disposed between adjacent electrodes. The polymer membrane acts as a separator membrane between electrodes and or as a reinforcement for the electrolyte . Other electrically insulating reinforcing fabrics can also be used as a separator membrane such as fabrics composed of polymeric fibers including aramid such as Kevlar ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene such as Spectra poly p phenylene benzobisoxazole such as Zylon nylon polyethylene polypropylene or combinations thereof. Other reinforcing materials such as glass fibers mineral fibers ceramics polymers and the like may also be used as a reinforcement material to enhance the strength and rigidity of the electrolyte . These reinforcement phases can take the form of particles short chopped fibers colloids fumed particles fumed particle clusters and can include materials such as clays zeolites glasses ceramic metal oxides ion conductive ceramics and carbon based materials such as graphite carbon nanotubes or fullerenes.

An electrolyte of the present invention may also be reinforced by an interpenetrating network of structural polymer. In one particular embodiment a foamed structural polymer is formed through reaction of a dispersed foaming agent or through a supercritical carbon dioxide process or through removal of a scavengeable filler such as salt particles that are removed by an aqueous wash or through selective thermal or chemical removal of a secondary polymer phase as in the case of a block copolymer or polymer blend. The void space in the foamed polymer can then be backfilled by the electrolyte. There are a variety of materials which may be employed as the electrolyte and one particular group of materials which may be used in the present invention includes but is not limited to ion conductive polymer electrolytes. Suggested polymer electrolytes include but are not limited to electrolytes described in Electrochemical and Mechanical Behavior in Mechanically Robust Solid Polymer Electrolytes for Use in Multifunctional Structural Batteries Chem. Mater 2007 19 3739 3801 by James F. Snyder et al. and in Improving Multifunctional Behavior in Structural Electrolytes Through Copolymerization of Structure and Conductivity Promoting Monomers Polymer 50 2009 4906 4916 by James F. Snyder et al. both of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein. In certain embodiments the polymer electrolyte is selected from the group of polycarbonates epoxies polyesters and polymers and copolymers of poly ethylene glycol and combinations thereof. Suggested polymer and copolymer of poly ethylene glycol electrolytic materials are crosslinked and more desirably are thermosetting polymers that are solvent free.

The electrolyte for the structural electrochemical capacitors of the present invention should be designed to balance structural and ion conduction properties and as such may be accomplished by controlling the structure and composition of the polymeric material itself through the use of functionalized structural polymers block copolymers or microscale mixtures of conductive and structural materials as well as by introducing the ionic species either by doping a polymer host with an ionic material such as a lithium salt that may or may not have an additional liquid solvent or by covalently affixing the ionic material directly on the polymer host to form a polyelectrolyte. Typical routes for improving polymer structural properties such as increasing crosslink density often lead directly to decreases in ion conductivity. However through appropriate design combinations of structural rigidity and ion conduction may be achieved. In some specific instances polymer electrolytes for use in the present invention include oligo oxyethylene units such as polyethylene glycols PEG . Such PEG oligomers readily dissolve lithium salts. A balance of mechanical and electrochemical properties is achieved by utilizing partially crosslinked polymer electrolyte matrices that combine linear and crosslinking resin monomers. The linear monomers will in some embodiments form comb polymers with freely mobile PEG side chains that facilitate ion conductivity while the crosslinking monomers form continuous polymer networks giving mechanical strength and stiffness to the electrolyte. One suggested electrolyte is illustrated in . The illustrated electrolyte includes a vinyl ester backbone and PEG sidechains and PEG crosslinks and also includes optional nanoparticle reinforcement to improve mechanical properties and optional liquid electrolyte or plasticizer to improve ion conductivity. Acrylated and methacrylated monomers may be employed in some embodiments as well as crosslinking monomers with multiple functional groups including but not limited to difunctional trifunctional tetrafunctional and pentafunctional crosslinking monomers. Suggested reinforcing materials include but are not limited to glass ceramics minerals organic polymers fibers of these materials and various combinations thereof.

As shown in the electrochemical capacitor further includes an electrical conductor electrically connecting the two pairs of electrodes in an interstratified relationship to from a circuit. It is to be understood that a plurality of cells of the type shown in may be electrically interconnected in a series parallel or mixed series parallel relationship to provide appropriate voltages and currents for specific applications. Furthermore the electrochemical capacitor as well as assemblies thereof may be further coated with encapsulated in or otherwise protected by an appropriate material.

The electrochemical capacitors of the present invention are rigid units and as such are capable of functioning as structural elements in a variety of constructions. The electrochemical capacitors may be configured in a variety of cross sectional shapes and in various lengths. As such the electrochemical capacitors may include hollow tubes sheets plates honeycomb structures as well as more complicated shapes. For example the electrochemical capacitors of the present invention may be configured to form a protective casing or housing for a piece of equipment. The electrochemical capacitors may be configured as structural elements including but not limited to body panels of vehicles for example ground vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles support frames structural beams such as structural I beans structural plates structural block structural struts structural casings structural housings a protective sheathing or as components of protective devices such as helmets ballistic armor and so forth.

Exemplary structural electrochemical capacitor laminates were fabricated via vacuum assisted resin transfer molding VARTM . All of the laminates were prepared on a glass tool surface coated with FREKOTE mold release. Each laminate consisted of two to six plies of a given fabric T300 3k from Textile Products Inc. separated with two plies of a polymer membrane separator Celgard 3501 . Typical cell dimensions were 4 inches by 4 inches. A structural electrolyte resin was injected into the layup under vacuum and allowed to cure at elevated temperature for at least 12 hours. The structural electrolyte was generated from 50 weight percent of tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate and 50 weight percent of methoxy poly ethylene glycol 550 acrylate with bis trifluoromethane sulfonimide lithium salt dissolved in both monomers.

Properties of the exemplary structural electrochemical capacitors were tested. Capacitances were measured by cyclic voltammetry experiments using a Brinkmann Potentiostat Galvanostat. Voltage was swept from 1V to 1V. At a scan rate of 2 mV s the capacitance was measured to be 7.5 milliFarads per gram for a two electrode two ply of carbon fabric cell in which the individual electrodes had capacitances of 42 milliFarads per gram in this configuration. Tensile tests were performed using an Instron 1125 load frame with a 10 000 lb load cell on samples based on the ASTM 3039 standard. Tensile samples were 5 in. 1 in. 1 16 in. Samples were gripped one inch on each edge resulting in a three inch gage length. Grip displacement was used to estimate the strain for each sample over the three inch gage area. Tensile modulus was measured to be 21 GPa. And lap shear tests were performed on an Instron 1125 load frame with a 1 000 lb load cell operated at 0.05 in min on samples based on the ASTM D5868 standard. Lap shear specimens were constructed of 1 in. 1 in. 1 16 in. panels each bonded to two 4 in. 1 in. 1 16 in. pieces of 7079 aluminum using Cytec FM94 adhesive. The bond area was 1 in. 1 in. The gripped area was tabbed with 1 in. 2 in. in. Dess Machining fiber glass tabs bonded with FM94 adhesive. The sides of the overlap area were sanded to reduce the effect of the adhesive flash. Lap shear strength was measured to be 1.33 MPa.

A series of solid polymer electrolytes were synthesized in accordance with the present invention. These electrolytes were prepared from monomers received from the Sartomer Company Inc. Polyethylene glycol with a molecular weight of 550 PEG 550 monoacrylate comb resin was used in all cases as a linear primary ion conducting phase. Nine difunctional and two trifunctional monomers were used as structural crosslinking components and these systems are summarized in Table 1 herein below. Similar measurements have been performed coupling other comb resins such as PEG 550 monomethacrylate comb resin with the crosslinking monomers listed in Table 1.

The difunctional monomers of systems 1 10 yield a single linear crosslink between polymer chains upon curing. For resin systems 1 6 this crosslink consists of a PEG group with a molecular weight of 200 400 or 600 as detailed in Table 1. For resin systems 6 9 this crosslink consists of two equal PEG chains on either side of a bisphenol A group where the PEG chains have either 2 5 or 15 repeat units as summarized in Table 1. Resin systems 11 and 12 are trifunctional with a trimethylpropane node that connects to three polymers through 1 TMP 3 or 5 TMP 5 units of PEG. The parenthetical notations a and m in Table 1 indicate that the monomer types were tested with acrylated a end groups or methacrylate m end groups. For each resin system a series of samples were prepared each sample having a different weight percentage of the comb versus crosslinking component. The proportions varied from 75 comb to 50 comb to 25 comb. Control samples were also prepared and they included 100 comb all PEG 550 and 0 comb no PEG 550 .

Addition of nanofillers was tested to improve the mechanical and electrochemical properties of solvent free polymer electrolytes. After preparing the monomer or comonomer solution with lithium salt nanofiller additives were dispersed into mixtures to generate nanocomposites. The fillers that were investigated included colloidal silica and fumed silica and were varied in concentration size shape and surface treatment. The polymer hosts investigated were made from comonomer solutions of PEG 550 methyl ether acrylate and PEG 660 bisphenol A diacrylate which form combs and networks respectively. These monomers were selected since they have very similar volume fractions of PEG and vinyl ester groups and the PEG oligomers are of comparable size. Since the chemical composition is similar copolymers ranging from 0 comb to 100 comb can track changes in the matrix resulting from formation of crosslinks without complication from other variables.

Liquid electrolytes are used in commercial devices owing to their low ionic resistances. The addition of small molecule solvents to solid state electrolytes can achieve plasticized or phase separated systems that facilitate ion conductivity. Properly formulated this approach may be done without comparable degradation of mechanical properties. Solutions of lithium salt doped propylene carbonate and lithium salt doped PEG 200 were each added to structural vinyl ester resins PEG 200 dimethacrylate as well as structural epoxy based resins EPON 828 with PACM hardening agent to form what is referred to here as polymer gels. Vinyl esters allow for facile resin injection and a wide range of architectures while epoxies provides the ability to generate partially cured components a.k.a. pre pregs that can be assembled and fully cured at a later time.

Combination of nanofiller and liquid electrolyte in a polymer matrix to form polymer gel nanocomposites were also investigated in which fumed silica was added in 2.5 wt or 5 wt to a propylene carbonate based gel system utilizing either epoxy amine or vinyl ester polymer matrix.

In preparing the polymer electrolytes all chemicals were handled in a glove box under dry nitrogen to prevent exposure to moisture. To form copolymers and nanocomposites lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate was dissolved directly into the vinyl ester monomers at 10 weight percent relative to mass of PEG in resin . The appropriate nanofiller was added to the monomer salt solution. Subsequently 1.5 weight percent relative to total mass of resin organic peroxide initiator Trigonox and 1.0 weight percent relative to total mass of resin dimethylaniline were added. The samples were heated in pellet shaped silicone rubber molds at 80 C. under nitrogen for 12 hours followed by a 100 C. post cure treatment for 1 hour. This produced hardened pellets of the polymer electrolyte material. The pellets were painted on both sides with quick drying silver paint and further heated to 80 C. under vacuum for 12 24 hours to remove residual solvent. The final geometry of each pellet was approximately 12.3 mm in diameter by 3 4 mm thickness. To form polymer gels and polymer gel nancocomposites 1 molar lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate solutions were prepared in both propylene carbonate and PEG 200. The appropriate amount of thus prepared liquid electrolyte was added to the appropriate amount of vinyl ester or epoxy monomer. Fumed silica was subsequently added in polymer gel nanocomposite samples. To the vinyl ester samples 1.5 weight percent relative to total mass of resin organic peroxide initiator Trigonox and 1.0 weight percent relative to total mass of resin cobalt napthenate were added. The latter enabled polymerization at temperatures lower than 80 C. including room temperature. To the epoxy samples 10 weight percent relative to total mass of resin PACM hardening agent was added. Pellet formation and polymerization proceeded as described for copolymers and nanocomposites although at lower cure and postcure temperatures that ranged from 20 C. to 80 C. and longer cure times that ranged from 24 hours to 96 hours.

Conductivity values for the thus prepared pellets were calculated from data collected through impedance spectroscopy over a frequency range of 10 Hz to 10Hz at 20 C. in an environmentally controlled zero humidity room. Uniaxial compression testing was carried out on the samples to evaluate their mechanical properties.

In view of the teaching and data presented herein one skilled in the art can formulate resins with a balanced combination of mechanical properties and ion conductivity to suit various electrochemical capacitor applications. In accordance with the present invention it is clear that still further improvements in performance of the electrolyte will be realized by further increasing the relative performance of the electrolyte with respect to conductivity and stiffness as indicated by the arrow in . Optimization of individual components that support ion conductivity and stiffness and optimized processing enabling full access to the component properties without degrading other properties such as may occur with liquid electrolyte backfilled into structural foams may provide improved performance. Furthermore as mentioned above reinforcing fibers particles fabrics or the like may be added to the electrolyte resin without impeding its ion transport properties and doing so will further enhance the mechanical properties of the resin. In addition it will be appreciated that techniques utilized for the manufacture of high strength polymeric composites can be readily adapted for use in the present invention to further strengthen the polymer matrix. Such techniques can involve the use of laminated layers of multiple materials incorporation of reinforcing materials and so forth. In such instances it is worth noting that for polymer matrix composites reinforced by stiff fibers matrix properties only dominate shear and interlaminar mechanical properties while tensile properties are largely governed by fiber properties so that through proper laminate and part design it will be possible to minimize the effect of matrix stiffness on global composite performance. In view of this teaching one of skill in the art can readily tailor both the electronic and physical properties of the electrolyte material for particular applications.

There are a variety of techniques which may be utilized for the preparation of structural electrochemical capacitors in accordance with the present invention. In one instance an appropriate electrolyte resin mixture may be disposed between appropriately configured electrodes and subsequently cured to produce a rigid structural electrochemical capacitor. In particular instances a vacuum assisted transfer molding process may be employed wherein a vacuum or low atmospheric pressure is used to draw a resin into a space between two electrodes. In other instances the electrochemical capacitor structures may be built up by laminating electrodes onto a previously cured body of polymeric electrode material. Lamination may be enhanced by use of heat and or pressure and or appropriately conductive adhesives which adhesives may include electrolyte resin formulations. In yet other instances an electrolyte resin formulation may be impregnated into a glass cloth or other separator structure which may then be interleaved and or rolled together with sheets of anode and cathode material and subsequently cured. Such techniques are known and available in the art and are used in the fabrication of what is referred to as prepreg resin structures. Yet other techniques which are or come to be known in the art may be adapted for the fabrication of the electrochemical capacitor systems of this invention. It is also to be understood that while the foregoing has provided a detailed description of systems which include a solid polymer electrolyte structural electrochemical capacitors of the present invention may also be prepared utilizing liquid gelled or other nonsolid electrolytes used in combination with relatively rigid anodes and or cathodes provided that the requisite strength is achieved.

The longevity and performance of electrochemical capacitors are often compromised by contact with external agents such as moisture or oxygen. Barrier materials are often incorporated into electrochemical capacitors to protect them from these external agents. These barrier agents can be directly incorporated into the present invention during initial fabrication or through secondary fabrication steps. Barrier materials could include metal foils or metalized polymer films which could be directly bonded to the electrochemical capacitor during cure of the electrolyte matrix.

In view of the foregoing it is to be understood that numerous modifications and variations of the present invention may be implemented by those of skill in the art. The foregoing drawings discussion and description are illustrative of some specific embodiments but are not meant to be a limitation upon the practice thereof. It is the following claims including all equivalents which define the scope of the invention.
