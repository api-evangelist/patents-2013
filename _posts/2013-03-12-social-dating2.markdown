title: Social dating
abstract: Systems and methods for social dating are provided. In particular, some embodiments provide recommendations for connections (i.e., candidate users) based on a user's social graph. These recommendations can identify potential single individuals that may be good matches for dating or can identify individuals with other commonalities or shared experiences to create dialog. For example, the recommendations for a user can include single individuals that are friends of a friend. The user can be presented with information about the recommendation and then ask for an introduction from the user's friend. As another example, the recommendations can be based on subject matter selected by the user (e.g., twins, cancer, phone type, etc.) with or without any friendship connections. The user may also be able to filter or further refine the searches based on other criteria such as interests, location, age, and/or other constraints. Rewards can be provided in some cases to encourage participation.

Various embodiments of the present invention generally relate to connecting people via a social graph. More specifically various embodiments of the present invention relate systems and methods for creating connections for social dating and or based on interest areas.

Users of social networking services may form connections associations or other relationships with other users based on real life interactions online interactions or a wide variety of other bases. For example users may choose to connect with others who are in the same geographic location who have a common circle of friends who have attended the same college or university etc. Existing social networking systems provide limited mechanisms for finding such connections.

In some instances for example social networking systems provide individuals with access to an introduction mechanism. The introduction mechanism may be as simple as showing the profiles of matched individuals through listings social network visualizations or through context aware match alerts and introduction management tools that aim to encourage interpersonal contact. Without doing a specific search for a user it is a common challenge for users to locate other users with whom they may wish to form a connection. Identifying users for specific types of connections is almost impossible. As such needs exist for improved techniques for identifying and connecting users.

Systems and methods are described for identifying and connecting users of a third party service through a social networking system. Some embodiments provide for a method that includes receiving a request from a first member of a social network to identify candidate users. The candidate users may include at least one candidate user associated with the third party service. Using a social graph from the social network a set of candidate users can be identified that match a preference set e.g. a relationship status of single or unknown location a medical experience a life experience etc. and include the at least one candidate user. Then a graphical user interface can be populated with profile information regarding the set of candidate users.

The first member can then request through the graphical user interface an introduction with a specific candidate user. In some embodiments one or more connector members from the social network suitable for introducing the first member to the specific candidate user can also be presented along with the candidate users. The first member can then submit a connection request through the graphical user interface to connect the first member to the specific candidate user via a specific connector member e.g. a common friend to the specific candidate user and the first member . Communications between the first member and the specific candidate via the specific connector member can also be facilitated.

Embodiments of the present invention also include computer readable storage media containing sets of instructions to cause one or more processors to perform the methods variations of the methods and other operations described herein.

Various embodiments also include a system having a database application programming interface server an identification module a graphical user interface GUI generation module a permissions module an advertisement module a filtering module and or a rewards module. The database may have a plurality of data about members objects and connections within a social network. This information can be used to form a social graph describing the interconnections of the members. The API server can receive information e.g. third party profiles that identifies a subset of the members that are associated with the third party service.

The identification module can be used to generate a set of candidate users for a first member of the social network. The set of candidate users can include members that match a preference set and are members of the social network and or the third party service. The identification module can access the database and use the data about the members objects and connections to rank the candidate users.

The GUI generation module can generate one or more graphical user interface screens to present profile information regarding each candidate user. In addition one or more connector members suitable for introducing a specific candidate user and the first member may also be presented within the GUI. The first member can then utilize the GUI to communicate with the first member and the connector member to request an introduction or find out additional information.

The permissions module can identify permissions set by each member regarding information about the set of candidate users that can be transmitted to the third party applications. The advertisement module can generate advertisements requesting the members of the social network allow the social network to share member information with the third party applications. The filtering module can reduce the set of candidate users based on one or more filter criteria e.g. location relationship status medical experience or life experience . The rewards module can determine one or more rewards based on participation of the first member with the third party applications.

While multiple embodiments are disclosed still other embodiments of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description which shows and describes illustrative embodiments of the invention. As will be realized the invention is capable of modifications in various aspects all without departing from the scope of the present invention. Accordingly the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not restrictive.

The drawings have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For example the dimensions of some of the elements in the figures may be expanded or reduced to help improve the understanding of the embodiments of the present invention. Similarly some components and or operations may be separated into different blocks or combined into a single block for the purposes of discussion of some of the embodiments of the present invention. Moreover while the invention is amenable to various modifications and alternative forms specific embodiments have been shown by way of example in the drawings and are described in detail below. The intention however is not to limit the invention to the particular embodiments described. On the contrary the invention is intended to cover all modifications equivalents and alternatives falling within the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.

Various embodiments of the present invention generally relate to connecting people via a social graph. More specifically various embodiments of the present invention relate systems and methods for creating connections for social dating and or based on identified interest areas specified by a user. Traditional social networking systems allow users to form connections associations or other relationships with other users based on real life interactions online interactions or a wide variety of other bases. Unfortunately these traditional systems do not easily identify potential candidate users for making romantic connections or based on specific interest areas specified by the user.

In contrast various embodiments of the present invention provide techniques for identifying candidate users that match a preference set of desired traits interests or experiences e.g. medical conditions such as breast cancer . In some embodiments the candidate users can be identified based on public and or private information on their profile e.g. relationship status . The information accessed for identifying the candidate users may be subject to privacy restrictions set by the user or social network. Once the candidate users have been identified additional mechanisms can be used to facilitate introductions. For example to facilitate introductions between members in some embodiments connector members e.g. members of the social network that are connected through a social graph can be used.

In some embodiments an application e.g. a third party application may connect with share information with or access the social network. Members of the social network can agree to participate with the third party application or service. Using a social graph of the social network candidate users that have agreed to participate in the third party service can be identified. For example if the third party service is a dating application the information retrieved could identify candidate users that have a relationship status of single and are interested in the gender of the user. In at least one embodiment the candidate users may be friends of friends of the candidate. Common friends or other types of connector users may be identified. The user can send inquiries to the common friend or connector user about a specific candidate user that is of interest. The application may also allow the user to filter the results e.g. based on location age etc. and identify the candidate users to save for later review.

The techniques introduced here can be embodied as special purpose hardware e.g. circuitry as programmable circuitry appropriately programmed with software and or firmware or as a combination of special purpose and programmable circuitry. Hence embodiments may include a machine readable medium having stored thereon instructions which may be used to program a computer or other electronic devices to perform a process. The machine readable medium may include but is not limited to floppy diskettes optical disks compact disc read only memories CD ROMs magneto optical disks read only memories ROMs random access memories RAMs erasable programmable read only memories EPROMs electrically erasable programmable read only memories EEPROMs magnetic or optical cards flash memory or other type of media machine readable medium suitable for storing electronic instructions.

Brief definitions of terms abbreviations and phrases used throughout this application are given below.

The terms connected or coupled and related terms are used in an operational sense and are not necessarily limited to a direct physical connection or coupling. Thus for example two devices may be coupled directly or via one or more intermediary channels or devices. As another example devices may be coupled in such a way that information can be passed there between while not sharing any physical connection with one another. Based on the disclosure provided herein one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate a variety of ways in which connection or coupling exists in accordance with the aforementioned definition.

The phrases in some embodiments according to various embodiments in the embodiments shown in other embodiments and the like generally mean the particular feature structure or characteristic following the phrase is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention and may be included in more than one embodiment of the present invention. In addition such phrases do not necessarily refer to the same embodiments or to different embodiments.

If the specification states a component or feature may can could or might be included or have a characteristic that particular component or feature is not required to be included or have the characteristic.

The term module refers broadly to software hardware or firmware or any combination thereof components. Modules are typically functional components that can generate useful data or other output using specified input s . A module may or may not be self contained. An application program also called an application may include one or more modules or a module can include one or more application programs.

User devices can be configured to communicate via the network which may comprise any combination of local area and or wide area networks using both wired and wireless communication systems. In one embodiment network uses standard communications technologies and or protocols. Thus network may include links using technologies such as Ethernet 802.11 worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX 3G 4G CDMA digital subscriber line DSL etc. Similarly the networking protocols used on network may include multiprotocol label switching MPLS transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP User Datagram Protocol UDP hypertext transport protocol HTTP simple mail transfer protocol SMTP and file transfer protocol FTP . Data exchanged over network may be represented using technologies and or formats including hypertext markup language HTML or extensible markup language XML . In addition all or some links can be encrypted using conventional encryption technologies such as secure sockets layer SSL transport layer security TLS and Internet Protocol security IPsec .

A preference set or set of criteria may be used to rank the candidate users and or select only a subset of the candidate users . For example user may be looking to meet new single people and the preference set may indicate that a relationship status of single or unknown be required for any of the friends of friends of user to be returned as candidate users. The preference set can also include other filters such as but not limited to interested in men interested in women geographic limitations age ranges and the like. In some embodiments the candidate users may be further restricted based on participation preferences and or privacy policies set within social networking system . The candidate users and or the connector members may be presented through a graphical user interface screen e.g. as illustrated in .

Memory can be any device mechanism or populated data structure used for storing information. In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention memory can encompass any type of but is not limited to volatile memory nonvolatile memory and dynamic memory. For example memory can be random access memory memory storage devices optical memory devices magnetic media floppy disks magnetic tapes hard drives SIMMs SDRAM DIMMs RDRAM DDR RAM SODIMMS erasable programmable read only memories EPROMs electrically erasable programmable read only memories EEPROMs compact disks DVDs and or the like. In accordance with some embodiments memory may include one or more disk drives flash drives one or more databases one or more tables one or more files local cache memories processor cache memories relational databases flat databases and or the like. In addition those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate many additional devices and techniques for storing information which can be used as memory .

Memory may be used to store instructions for running one or more applications or modules on processor s . For example memory could be used in one or more embodiments to house all or some of the instructions needed to execute the functionality of identification module permission module advertisement module filtering module rewards module and or GUI generation module .

Identification module can generate a set of candidate users that match preferences supplied by a request from a connection application. The request may identify the user submitting the request and may include a preference set. In some cases the preference set may be associated with the application itself or include elements designated by the application. For example a dating application may have a preference set that requests only members of the social network that have a relationship status of single or unknown be returned. In other cases the user may specify additional filter criteria such as age location life experience e.g. has twins interests medical experiences etc. Identification module can generate the set of candidate users based on the preference set and the members objects and connections within the social network and or the third party service. In some embodiments identification module may only generate the set of candidate users from friends of friends of the user submitting the request.

Permission module can be communicably coupled to identification module and configured to identify permissions set by each member the application the third party service and or the social network. The permissions may include restrictions regarding information about the set of candidate users that can be transmitted shared and or used to identify candidate users. In some cases only candidate users that are members of the third party service and or have opted in for participation may be included in the candidate users. As another example if the requesting user is over eighteen years of age permissions module may filter out anyone that is younger than eighteen years of age. Filtering module can reduce the set of candidate users based on one or more filter criteria such as but not limited to location relationship status medical experience or life experience.

Advertisement module can generate advertisements requesting the members of the social network allow the social network to share member information with the third party applications. In exchange for participation one or more rewards may be granted by rewards module . For example if the third party application is associated with a mobile phone manufacturer then users may be able to search of candidate users that have or have had a particular mobile phone. The users may be seeking these candidate users for discussions regarding the mobile phone. In exchange for participation rewards module may offer discounts on new phones from the manufacturer or early access to new devices.

GUI generation module can generate one or more graphical user interface screens. These screens can be used to display information e.g. regarding the candidate users and or connector users . In some embodiments the graphical user interface screens can be used to assign filter criteria to the preference set selecting rewards messaging candidate users messaging connector users messaging other members of the social networking system and or other activities.

Once the candidate users have been identified population operation can populate a GUI with profile information regarding one or more of the candidate users. Using the GUI the first member can review the profile information and determine if an introduction would be desirable. During introduction operation the GUI can receive an introduction request from the first member that identifies a specific candidate. In response one or more connector members can be displayed on the GUI during connector operation . In other embodiments connector operation may display the connector members within the GUI along with the profile information during population operation .

The first member can review the connector members and determine a specific connector member to facilitate the connection or to simply find out more information about the specific candidate user. Once the first member has identified a specific connector member the user can submit a connection request which is received at the GUI during connection request receiving operation . Communication operation can then facilitate communications e.g. through a private chat between the first member and the specific candidate user via the specific connector member.

Presentation operation presents the information about the remaining candidate users to the user. However since compliance with the preference criteria set can change monitoring operation monitors the set of potential candidate users e.g. the friends of friends for updates. If no change is detected detection operation branches back to monitoring operation . If a change is detected the detection operation branches to determination operation where a determination to add or remove candidate users is made. Then updated information about the remaining candidate users is presented during update operation .

As mentioned above embodiments of the present invention can be utilized within a social networking system. Typically a social networking system includes one or more computing devices storing user profiles associated with users and or other objects as well as connections between users and other users and or objects. In use users join the social networking system and then add connections to other users or objects of the social networking system to which they desire to be connected. The users may be individuals or entities such as businesses organizations universities or manufacturers. The social networking system allows its users to interact with each other as well as with other objects maintained by the social networking system. In some embodiments the social networking system allows users to interact with third party websites and financial account providers.

Based on stored data about users objects and connections between users and or objects the social networking system can generate and maintain a social graph comprising a plurality of nodes interconnected by a plurality of edges. Each node in the social graph represents an object or user that can act on another node and or that can be acted on by another node. An edge between two nodes in the social graph represents a particular kind of connection between the two nodes which may result from an action that was performed by one of the nodes on the other node. For example when a user identifies an additional user as a friend an edge in the social graph is generated connecting a node representing the first user and an additional node representing the additional user. The generated edge has a connection type indicating that the users are friends. As various nodes interact with each other the social networking system can modify edges connecting the various nodes to reflect the interactions.

API request server allows other systems user devices or tools to access information from social networking system by calling APIs. The information provided by the social network may include user profile information or the connection information of users as determined by their individual privacy settings. For example a system user device or tools interested in accessing data connections within a social networking system may send an API request to social networking system via a network. The API request is received at social networking system by API request server . API request server processes the request by submitting the access request to an access management system where access is determined and any data communicated back to the requesting system user device or tools via a network.

Web server links social networking system via a network to one or more client devices the web server serves web pages as well as other web related content such as Java Flash XML and so forth. The web server may communicate with the message server that provides the functionality of receiving and routing messages between social networking system and client devices. The messages processed by message server can be instant messages queued messages e.g. email text and SMS short message service messages or any other suitable messaging technique. In some embodiments a message sent by a user to another can be viewed by other users of social networking system for example by the connections of the user receiving the message. An example of a type of message that can be viewed by other users of the social networking system besides the recipient of the message is a wall post. In some embodiments a user can send a private message to another user that can only be retrieved by the other user.

Each user of the social networking system is associated with a user profile which is stored in user profile store . A user profile includes declarative information about the user that was explicitly shared by the user and may also include profile information inferred by social networking system . In one embodiment a user profile includes multiple data fields each data field describing one or more attributes of the corresponding user of social networking system . The user profile information stored in user profile store describes the users of social networking system including biographic demographic and other types of descriptive information such as work experience educational history gender hobbies preferences location and the like. A user profile may also store other information provided by the user for example images or videos. In certain embodiments images of users may be tagged with identification information of users of social networking system displayed in an image. A user profile in user profile store may also maintain references to actions by the corresponding user performed on content items in content store and stored in the edge store .

A user profile may be associated with one or more financial accounts allowing the user profile to include data retrieved from or derived from a financial account. A user may specify one or more privacy settings which are stored in the user profile that limit information from a financial account that social networking system is permitted to access. For example a privacy setting limits social networking system to accessing the transaction history of the financial account and not the current account balance. As another example a privacy setting limits social networking system to a subset of the transaction history of the financial account allowing social networking system to access transactions within a specified time range transactions involving less than a threshold transaction amount transactions associated with specified vendor identifiers transactions associated with vendor identifiers other than specified vendor identifiers or any suitable criteria limiting information from a financial account identified by a user that is accessible by social networking system . In one embodiment information from the financial account is stored in user profile store . In other embodiments it may be stored in financial account store .

Action logger receives communications about user actions on and or off social networking system populating action log with information about user actions. Such actions may include for example adding a connection to another user sending a message to another user uploading an image reading a message from another user viewing content associated with another user attending an event posted by another user among others. In some embodiments action logger receives subject to one or more privacy settings transaction information from a financial account associated with a user and identifies user actions from the transaction information. For example action logger retrieves vendor identifiers from the financial account s transaction history and identifies an object such as a page in social networking system associated with the vendor identifier. This allows action logger to identify a user s purchases of products or services that are associated with a page or another object in content store . In addition a number of actions described in connection with other objects are directed at particular users so these actions are associated with those users as well. These actions are stored in action log .

Action log may be used by social networking system to track user actions on social networking system as well as external websites that communicate information to social networking system . Users may interact with various objects on social networking system including commenting on posts sharing links and checking in to physical locations via a mobile device accessing content items in a sequence or other interactions Information describing these actions is stored in action log . Additional examples of interactions with objects on social networking system included in action log include commenting on a photo album communications between users becoming a fan of a musician adding an event to a calendar joining a group becoming a fan of a brand page creating an event authorizing an application using an application and engaging in a transaction. Additionally action log records a user s interactions with advertisements on social networking system as well as other applications operating on social networking system . In some embodiments data from action log is used to infer interests or preferences of the user augmenting the interests included in the user profile and allowing a more complete understanding of user preferences.

Action log may also store user actions taken on external websites and or determined from a financial account associated with the user. For example an e commerce website that primarily sells sporting equipment at bargain prices may recognize a user of social networking system through social plug ins that enable the e commerce website to identify the user of social networking system . Because users of social networking system are uniquely identifiable e commerce websites such as this sporting equipment retailer may use the information about these users as they visit their websites. Action log records data about these users including webpage viewing histories advertisements that were engaged purchases made and other patterns from shopping and buying. Actions identified by action logger from the transaction history of a financial account associated with the user allow action log to record further information about additional types of user actions.

In some embodiments social networking system further stores data describing one or more connections between different users in the connection store . The data describing one or more connections can include a list of connections a date each connection i.e. friendship was made etc. The connections may be further defined by users allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example the connections allow users to generate relationships with other users that parallel the users real life relationships such as friends co workers partners and so forth. In one embodiment the connection specifies a connection type based on the type of relationship. Examples of the type of relationship include family friend colleague etc. Users may select from predefined types of connections or define their own connection types as needed. Some or all of this information may also be stored as edge objects in edge store .

Content store stores content items associated with a user profile such as images videos or audio files. Content items from content store may be displayed when a user profile is viewed or when other content associated with the user profile is viewed. For example displayed content items may show images or video associated with a user profile or show text describing a user s status. Additionally other content items may facilitate user engagement by encouraging a user to expand his connections to other users to invite new users to the system or to increase interaction with the social network system by displaying content related to users objects activities or functionalities of social networking system . Examples of social networking content items include suggested connections or suggestions to perform other actions media provided to or maintained by social networking system e.g. pictures or videos status messages or links posted by users to the social networking system events groups pages e.g. representing an organization or commercial entity and any other content provided by or accessible via the social networking system.

Content store also includes one or more pages associated with entities having user profiles in user profile store . An entity is a non individual user of social networking system such as a business a vendor an organization or a university. A page includes content associated with an entity and instructions for presenting the content to a social networking system user. For example a page identifies content associated with the entity s user profile as well as information describing how to present the content to users viewing the brand page. Vendors may be associated with pages in content store allowing social networking system users to more easily interact with the vendor via social networking system . A vendor identifier is associated with a vendor s page allowing social networking system to identify the vendor and or to retrieve additional information about the vendor from user profile store action log or from any other suitable source using the vendor identifier. In some embodiments the content store may also store one or more targeting criteria associated with stored objects and identifying one or more characteristics of a user to which the object is eligible to be presented.

In one embodiment edge store stores the information describing connections between users and other objects on social networking system in edge objects. Some edges may be defined by users allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example users may generate edges with other users that parallel the users real life relationships such as friends co workers partners and so forth. Other edges are generated when users interact with objects in social networking system such as expressing interest in a page on the social networking system sharing a link with other users of the social networking system and commenting on posts made by other users of the social networking system. Edge store stores edge objects that include information about the edge such as affinity scores for objects interests and other users. Affinity scores may be computed by social networking system over time to approximate a user s affinity for an object interest and other users in social networking system based on the actions performed by the user. Multiple interactions between a user and a specific object may be stored in one edge object in edge store in one embodiment. In some embodiments connections between users may be stored in user profile store or user profile store may access edge store to determine connections between users.
