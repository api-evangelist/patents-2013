This invention was made with government support under DE AC26 07NT42677 awarded by Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in the invention.

Embodiments of the present disclosure relate generally to high voltage cable termination and more particularly to a system and method for underwater termination of high voltage power cables.

Typically in an oil and gas well power to electrical components on the sea floor is supplied from sea or land based power sources. In one example the electrical components may include submerged process control equipment pumping equipment compression equipment motors and the like. These electrical components may be used to govern the extraction and injection of gas and liquids from the oil and gas well.

In general high voltage power cables are used to supply power from the sea or land based power sources to these electrical components. Moreover the high voltage power cables may be electrically connected to the electrical components using sub sea connectors. Additionally at large sea depths multiple high voltage power cables may be required to supply power to these electrical components thereby necessitating the interconnection of these high voltage power cables via the sub sea connectors.

Since the sub sea connectors are used for underwater electrical connections these connectors may be subjected to harsh environments such as varying sea water pressure and sea water ingression which in turn may damage the connectors and or electrical components. Also retrieving the connectors for repair entails high expenditure.

In a conventional system alternate current AC power cables and AC connectors are used to supply AC power to the electrical components on the sea floor. However as oil exploration and drilling activities extend to deeper water depths power transmission over long distances poses a bigger challenge for AC power cables because of the capacitive load of the cables. Thus DC power transmission is a highly promising solution for sub sea electrical components. In addition the existing AC connectors cannot be used to connect DC power cables for DC power transmission because of special field distribution properties under DC which may lead to failure of the AC connectors.

In accordance with one embodiment described herein an electrical connector is presented. The electrical connector includes a first cable termination chamber configured to receive a first power cable comprising at least a first conductor sheathed at least in part by a first insulating layer and a first insulation screen layer. Also the electrical connector includes a first non linear resistive layer configured to be coupled to a portion of the first conductor unsheathed by at least the first insulation screen layer and configured to control a direct current electric field generated in the first cable termination chamber. In addition the electrical connector includes a first deflector configured to be coupled to the first power cable and control an alternating current electric field generated in the first cable termination chamber.

In accordance with a further aspect of the present disclosure a method for controlling an electric field in an electrical connector is presented. The method includes receiving by a first cable termination chamber a first power cable including at least a first conductor sheathed at least in part by a first insulating layer and a first insulation screen layer. Also the method includes controlling a direct current electric field generated in the first cable termination chamber by coupling a first non linear resistive layer to a portion of the first conductor unsheathed by at least the first insulation screen layer. Further the method includes controlling an alternating current electric field generated in the first cable termination chamber by coupling a first deflector to the first power cable.

As will be described in detail hereinafter various embodiments of exemplary systems and methods for providing sub sea electrical connections for DC power cables are presented. By employing the methods and the various embodiments of the system described hereinafter direct current DC electric fields and or alternate current AC electric fields generated at the termination of power cables may be substantially minimized which in turn reduces stress induced in components that are used for the electrical connections.

In addition these chambers may be filled with a dielectric fluid .

Furthermore the first power cable may be disposed in the inner cylindrical cavity of the first pressure control chamber . Also the first power cable may be terminated in the first cable termination chamber as depicted in . It may be noted that the first power cable may be representative of one of the power cables that are deployed underwater to supply power from a power source to the electrical components that are disposed on the sea floor.

The inner cylindrical cavity may be used to receive a second power cable . In one embodiment the second power cable may be representative of one of the power cables that may be coupled to the electrical components on the sea floor. In another embodiment the second power cable may be representative of one of the multiple power cables that are interconnected to form a long cable in the sub sea water. Further the second power cable may be disposed in the inner cylindrical cavity of the second pressure control chamber . Moreover the second power cable may be terminated in the second cable termination chamber as depicted in .

The second power cable may also include a plurality of concentric layers that are disposed on one another.

In a similar manner the second cable termination chamber may include a steel chamber that is filled with the dielectric fluid . Further the steel chamber may be sealed to prevent sea water ingression under high sea water pressure. In addition the steel chamber may include a second stress cone and a second Faraday cage . Particularly the second stress cone may be disposed at one end of the second cable termination chamber . The second stress cone may include an aperture that is aligned with the inner cylindrical cavity of the second pressure control chamber to receive the second power cable from the second pressure control chamber . Also the second stress cone is configured to terminate the insulation screen layer of the second power cable . In one example the second stress cone may include an insulating rubber unit not shown in that blocks terminates the insulation screen layer of the second power cable . Further the other layers of the second power cable such as the conductor the conductive screen layer and the insulating layer may be extended further beyond the second stress cone .

In a presently contemplated configuration the piston subunit may include the retractable pin that may be moved to an ON or OFF position.

However if the retractable pin is moved to the OFF position the first conducting pin may be electrically decoupled from the second conducting pin . Also the piston subunit may be positioned in the dielectric fluid such as oil to provide insulation to the first and second conducting pins when the retractable pin is in the OFF position. In addition the dielectric fluid may be used to prevent sea water ingression into the piston subunit .

Typically conventional electrical connectors are employed to connect power cables that are used for AC power transmission. However as oil exploration and drilling activities extend to greater water depths and longer step outs power transmission over long distances becomes increasingly challenging for AC power cables because of the capacitive load of the cables. Thus DC power transmission is a highly promising solution for sub sea electrical components. If AC connectors are used for DC power transmission special field distribution properties associated with DC may lead to failure of the AC connectors. More specifically while the DC electric field distribution may be determined by the resistivity of the materials the AC field distribution may be determined by the dielectric constant corresponding to the material. Also the resistivity may vary by several orders of magnitude across different insulators in the electrical connector. In one example the resistivity in oil may be less than 10ohm m and the resistivity in cable insulation may be greater than 10ohm m. Moreover the resistivity may vary with change in temperature. On the other hand the dielectric constant may have minimal variation with change in temperature. In one example the dielectric constant may typically vary between 2 and 4. Thus the uniformity and or predictability of the DC field distribution may be lower than the uniformity and or predictability of the AC field. In addition under transient events the field distribution may contain both resistively graded components and capacitively graded components. Also space charge accumulation may occur under DC voltages which in turn leads to further field distortions. These factors may result in severe enhancement of not only the DC fields but also the AC fields that may exist when the voltage is varied. This enhancement of the DC and AC fields may in turn create internal stress on the components employed in the AC connectors. This stress in turn may damage the components and or the power cables that are coupled to the AC connectors.

To overcome the above shortcomings in one exemplary embodiment the electrical connector may be used for electrically coupling DC power cables . In one embodiment the first cable termination chamber may include a first non linear resistive layer that is disposed along an unsheathed portion of the first power cable in the first cable termination chamber . The unsheathed portion may be defined as a portion of the power cable that includes only the conductor the conductive screen layer and the insulation layer. More specifically the first non linear resistive layer may include a first end that is coupled to one end of the insulation screen layer of the first power cable and a second end that is coupled to the first Faraday cage .

In a similar manner the second cable termination chamber of the electrical connector may include a second non linear resistive layer that is disposed along an unsheathed portion of the second power cable . Here again the second non linear resistive layer may include a first end that is coupled to one end of the insulation screen layer of the second power cable and a second end that is coupled to the second Faraday cage . These non linear resistive layers may be configured to control the DC electric field that may be generated in the first and second cable termination chambers . More specifically by disposing the non linear resistive layers along the unsheathed portions of the first and second power cables the DC electric field may be uniformly distributed across the electrical connector . This uniform distribution of the DC electric field may in turn prevent the concentration of the DC electric field in the connector particularly in the cable termination chambers thereby minimizing stress due to the concentrated DC electric field on the components and or the cables in the electrical connector .

Furthermore during transient events the DC voltage in the power cables may change rapidly and may induce an AC electric field across the connector . This AC electric field may also create stress on the components of the connector . To control this AC electric field along with the DC electric field the non linear resistive layers may include non linear semi conductive fillers and or dielectric fillers. In one example the semi conductive fillers may include carbon black silicon carbide and zinc oxide. Also the dielectric fillers may include ferroelectric fillers such as barium titanate and anti ferroelectric fillers such as lead zirconate titanate stannate. These non linear semi conductive fillers may aid in reducing the resistivity of the layers when the non linear resistive layers are subjected to high electric fields. This reduction in the resistivity of the non linear resistive layers in turn aids in reducing or uniformly distributing the DC electric field across the connector . Similarly the dielectric fillers aid in increasing the dielectric constant of the layers when subjected to high fields. This increase in the dielectric constant of the non linear resistive layers in turn reduces the accumulation of the AC electric field in the connector .

Moreover the first non linear resistive layer and the second non linear resistive layer may be selected such that the resistivity of each of these layers is respectively less than the resistivity of the insulation layer of the first power cable and the insulation layer of the second power cable . The low resistivity of the non linear resistive layers aids in uniformly distributing the generated DC electric field across the connector . More specifically the low resistivity of the non linear resistive layers may aid in reducing harmful charges that may build up in the cable termination chambers due to the DC electric field. Additionally stresses experienced by the connector due to rapid changes in the DC voltage in the power cables may also be substantially reduced. In one example the DC voltage may be in range from about 36 kV to about 500 kV. Thus the concentration of the DC electric field and the stress that may occur due to this concentrated DC electric field may be controlled by placing the one or more non linear resistive layers along the unsheathed portions of the power cables in the first and second cable termination chambers . The structure and composition of the non linear resistive layers will be explained in greater detail with reference to .

In addition the DC voltage in the power cables may change rapidly and may induce an AC electric field across the connector . This AC electric field may be concentrated across the connector and may damage the components in the connector . The exemplary electrical connector may be configured to control this AC electric field that is generated in the first and second cable termination chambers . Particularly the electrical connector may include one or more deflectors that may be configured to aid in minimizing the AC electric field in the connector . In one embodiment due to faults in the power cables switching impulses and transients may occur in the power cables. These switching impulses and transients may cause or increase electrical fields in the electrical connector . In the exemplary electrical connector the one or more deflectors may be configured to minimize these electric fields in the electrical connector . Moreover the deflectors may be designed to have a determined geometric shape that aids in capacitive grading of the AC electric field generated in the cable termination chambers . One such geometric shape of the deflectors is depicted in . The aspect of reducing the AC electric field using the deflectors will be explained in greater detail with reference to .

Furthermore the AC electric field may be reduced by using Faraday cages in the cable termination chambers where the Faraday cases may have a predefined shape. Particularly as depicted in the first and second Faraday cages may include a corresponding extended conductive arm that aids in minimizing or reducing the concentration of the AC electric field in the electrical connector . More specifically the extended conductive arms may be used to optimize the direction and distribution of the electric field that is generated between the arms and the conductors . By optimizing the direction and distribution of the AC electric field the concentration of the AC electric field in the electrical connector may be substantially reduced. The structure and dimensions of extended conductive arms in the first and second Faraday cages will be explained in greater detail with reference to .

In addition the first and second Faraday cages may be insulated by epoxy that is disposed in the steel chambers of the connector . In one embodiment the epoxy may include one or more fillers such as calcium carbonate quartz fumed silica talc kaolinite and montmorillonite. Further the filler concentration in the epoxy may be in a range from about 0 to about 80 by weight. Moreover the structure of the epoxy may have different forms. In one embodiment the region beneath the conductive arms of the Faraday cages may be completely filled with the epoxy . Also the region between the stress cones and the Faraday cages may be filled with the epoxy . In another embodiment the stress cones may extend to an end of a corresponding extended conductive arm of the Faraday cages . Further a portion between the stress cones and a corresponding extended conductive arm may be filled with the epoxy . Also the region beneath the extended conductive arms may be filled with the epoxy .

In a presently contemplated configuration the first and second non linear resistive layers may be disposed along the surface of a respective insulation layer of the power cables . Particularly the first non linear resistive layer may extend along the insulation layer from the first deflector in the first stress cone to the first Faraday cage in the first cable termination chamber . Also the first non linear resistive layer may be in electrical contact with the first deflector and the first Faraday cage . In a similar manner the second non linear resistive layer may extend along the insulation layer from the second deflector in the second stress cone to the second Faraday cage in the second cable termination chamber . Moreover the non linear resistive layer may be in electrical contact with the second deflector and the second Faraday cage .

In addition the non linear resistive layers may be made of a special stress grading material SGM . The SGM may include a host material and one or more fillers. The host material may be a cross linked silicone rubber and or an un cross linked silicone compound having low molecular weight. Further the one or more filler materials may include particles fibers and or platelets that may be made of carbon zinc oxide silicon carbide barium titanate and lead zirconate titanate. In one embodiment these non linear resistive layers may have a thickness that is in a range from about 0.01 mm to about 20 mm. Also the non linear resistive layers may be in one or more physical forms. In some non limiting examples the physical forms may include a pre molded tube curable paint applied on the surface of the cable un curable grease or compounds applied on the surface of the cable tapes wrapped around the cable and these tapes may be consolidated using pressure and or temperature and surface layers molded into the silicone stress cone and or epoxy insulation.

Turning now to a block diagram representation of a portion of the electrical connector of is depicted. In particular depicts the piston subunit of . As illustrated in the piston subunit may include a conducting portion and a non conducting portion . The non conducting portion may include epoxy material that is doped with a conductive material to reduce the DC electric field along the piston subunit .

Also in another embodiment the electrical connector may include one or more segments of a stress grading layer that are disposed in the wet mate chamber . The stress grading layer may aid in reducing the DC electric field in the wet mate chamber . These segments of the stress grading layer may be disposed on a surface of the piston subunit that interfaces with the conducting pins . Particularly as depicted in a first segment of the stress grading layer may be disposed along the surface of the non conducting portion that is facing the first conducting pin of the piston subunit . Similarly the second segment of the stress grading layer may be disposed along the surface of the non conducting portion that is facing the second conducting pin . These segments of the stress grading layer may aid in uniformly distributing the DC electric field around the piston subunit and thereby reducing the concentration of the DC electric field in the connector .

In one embodiment the stress grading layer may include a host material and one or more filler materials. The host material may include an epoxy material and or a cross linked silicone rubber. Further the one or more filler materials may include particles fibers and or platelets that may be made of carbon zinc oxide silicon carbide barium titanate and lead zirconate titanate. Also the stress grading layer in the wet mate chamber may be in one or more physical forms. Some non limiting examples of the physical forms include a pre molded tube curable paint applied on the surface of the epoxy insulation tapes wrapped around the epoxy insulation and these tapes may be consolidated using pressure and or temperature surface layers molded into the epoxy insulation. Moreover the stress grading layer may have a conductivity that is higher than the conductivity of the non linear resistive layers .

Thus by employing one or more non linear resistive layers one or more stress grading layers one or more deflectors and one or more Faraday cages with extended conductive arms in the electrical connector the DC electric field and the AC electric field may be controlled or substantially reduced in the electrical connector .

Referring now to a diagrammatical representation of a deflector embedded in a stress cone in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure is depicted. The stress cone and the deflector may be representative of the first stress cone having the first deflector or the second stress cone having the second deflector of . The stress cone may be made of insulation rubber. In one example the insulation rubber may include unfilled silicone rubber or silicone rubber reinforced with inorganic fillers. Further the deflector may be embedded inside the stress cone . In one embodiment as depicted in the field deflector may be in the form of a solid piece of conductive rubber that is embedded inside the insulating rubber of the stress cone . The conductive rubber may be formed by filling the insulating rubber with conductive fillers. The insulating rubber may include silicone and the conductive fillers may include carbon and metal. In one example the carbon may include carbon black carbon fibers carbon nanotubes and or graphene. In another example the metal may include silver nickel and or copper in the form of particles or fibers. Further the size of the conductive fillers in the conductive rubber may be in a range from about 1 nm to about 100 m. Also the conductivity of the conductive rubber may be in a range from about 0.001 S m to about 10000 S m.

Turning now to a diagrammatical representation of a deflector embedded in a stress cone in accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure is depicted. The stress cone and the deflector may be similar to the stress cone and the deflector of except that the deflector of is in the form of a solid piece of conductive rubber while the deflector is in the form of a conductive surface that is embedded in the insulating rubber of the stress cone .

Referring now to a diagrammatical representation of a portion of a Faraday cage including an extended conductive arm of in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure is depicted. Reference numeral may be representative of the first Faraday cage or the second Faraday cage of . The Faraday cage is used to couple a respective power cable to the piston subunit . Also the Faraday cage includes the extended conductive arm that aids in optimizing the direction and distribution of an AC electric field in the cable termination chambers which in turn reduces the concentration of the AC electric field in the connector .

The Faraday cage may be formed by a metal with an extended conductive arm . The metal may be copper or aluminum. Also the extended conductive arm may have a width a 704 that may be in a range from about 0.01 m to about 0.5 m. Also the extended conductive arm may be at an angle from the surface of the power cable that is coupled to the Faraday cage . In one example the angle may be in a range from about 45 degrees to about 60 degrees. Furthermore the extended conductive arm may have a height h from the surface of the power cable. Also a ratio between the height and the width of the extended conductive arm may be in a range from about 0.01 to about 2. In addition the tip of the extended conductive arm may have a circular shape with radius r that is in a range from about 0.001 m to about 0.05 m.

Referring to a flow chart illustrating a method for controlling an electric field in an electrical connector such as the electrical connector of in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure is depicted. For ease of understanding the method is described with reference to the components of . The method begins at step where the first power cable may be received by the first cable termination chamber . The first power cable may be used for transmitting HVDC power to the electrical components on the sea floor. Also the first power cable may include the first conductor that is sheathed at least in part by at least the first insulating layer and the first insulation screen layer .

Subsequently at step a DC electric field generated in the first cable termination chamber may be controlled. In one embodiment the DC electric field generated in the first cable termination chamber may be controlled by coupling the first non linear resistive layer to a portion of the first conductor that is unsheathed by at least the first insulation screen layer . The unsheathed portion of the first conductor may be defined as a portion of the first power cable that is unsheathed by the insulation screen layer and the outer layer . Particularly the first non linear resistive layer may extend along the unsheathed portion of the first conductor from the first deflector in the first stress cone to the first Faraday cage . Also the first non linear resistive layer may be in electrical contact with the first deflector and the first Faraday cage . The first non linear resistive layer may be designed such that the resistivity of this layer is less than the resistivity of the insulation screen layer . The low resistivity of the non linear resistive layer aids in uniformly distributing the generated DC electric field along the electrical connector . This uniform distribution of the DC electric field may in turn prevent the concentration of the DC electric field in the connector particularly in the cable termination chamber thereby minimizing stress due to the concentrated DC electric field on the components and or the cable in the electrical connector .

In addition as indicated by step an AC electric field generated in the first cable termination chamber may be controlled. In one embodiment the AC electric field in the first cable termination chamber may be controlled by coupling the first deflector to the first power cable . Particularly the first deflector may be disposed or embedded within the first stress cone and may be coupled to one end of the insulation screen layer . Also the first deflector may be designed to have a determined geometric shape that aids in optimizing the direction and distribution of the AC electric field. Optimizing the direction and distribution of the AC electric field may in turn minimizes or reduces the concentration of the AC electric field in the electrical connector . In another embodiment the AC electric field generated in the first cable termination chamber may be controlled by coupling the first Faraday cage to the first conductor . More specifically the first Faraday cage may include an extended conductive arm that is used to optimize the direction and distribution of the AC electric field generated in the first cable termination chamber . By optimizing the direction and distribution of the AC electric field the concentration of the AC electric field in the electrical connector may be substantially reduced.

Thus by employing one or more non linear resistive layers one or more deflectors and one or more Faraday cages with extended conductive arms in the electrical connector the DC electric field and the AC electric field may be controlled and or substantially reduced in the electrical connector . This in turn reduces the stress on the components in the electrical connector and prevents damage of the electrical connector and or the power cables .

The various embodiments of the system and method aid in providing HVDC power transmission to electrical components on the sea floor. Since the connectors are designed with one or more non linear resistive layers and deflectors cost of manufacturing and or maintaining these connectors may be substantially reduced.
