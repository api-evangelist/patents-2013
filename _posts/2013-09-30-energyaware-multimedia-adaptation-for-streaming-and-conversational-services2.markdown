This application claims the benefit of and hereby incorporates by reference U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 707 784 filed Sep. 28 2012.

The growth of multimedia services including streaming and conversational services is one of the key drivers of the evolution to new mobile broadband technologies and standards. Digital video content is increasingly consumed in mobile devices. There are many video applications extensively used on mobile devices in daily life. For example online video streaming include popular services such as YouTube and Hulu. Video recording and video conferencing include services such as Skype and Google Hangout. In 2011 YouTube had more than 1 trillion global views. Ten percent of the views were accessed via mobile phones or tablets. As more smart phones tablets and other mobile computing devices are purchased their use for video recording and video conferencing will increase dramatically. With such high consumer demand for multimedia services coupled with developments in media compression and wireless network infrastructures it is of interest to enhance the multimedia service capabilities of future cellular and mobile broadband systems and deliver high quality of experience QoE to the consumers thereby ensuring ubiquitous access to video content and services from any location at any time with any device and technology.

Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.

Before the present invention is disclosed and described it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures process steps or materials disclosed herein but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element. Numbers provided in flow charts and processes are provided for clarity in illustrating steps and operations and do not necessarily indicate a particular order or sequence.

An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

The amount of power available to mobile communication devices has been fairly constant for years. The demands on mobile communication devices to be used for more power intensive services such as video streaming and video conferencing increases the amount of power used at the mobile communication devices. The rise in power consumption will continue with a market demand that is trending toward more advanced video services. For instance the use of high definition HD video services at resolution levels of 1024p 2048p 4096p etc. and three dimensional 3D video services such as those based on the Moving Picture Experts Group s MPEG s multi view coding MVC standard and more advanced codecs such as those based on MPEG s High Efficiency Video Coding HEVC standard which are known to consume substantially more power.

However with the power available in battery technology remaining substantially constant there is an amplified need to increase the power efficiency of the services offered on the mobile communication devices. The encoding and decoding processes used in video streaming and video conferencing have not necessarily been developed based on power efficiency since they have historically been used on desktop and fixed location computing devices. The amount of power consumed in a mobile communication device during the process of encoding transmitting receiving and decoding can be significant. Accordingly there is a need to improve the efficiency when streaming and conferencing services are used on mobile communication devices. Accordingly mobile video applications can be configured to not only provide a good viewing experience but also to avoid excessive energy consumption through the use of powerful codecs and high definition video especially when mobile devices are running low on the amount of power available in their battery.

A mobile device consists of many parts which require power. Among them video codec and display subsystem as well as their associated memory are two major power consumption sources for video processing. Video decoding power consumption can depend on the capabilities of the computer processing unit CPU or graphics processing unit GPU . Video display power consumption can depend on display resolution display size and display type. Unlike older monochrome displays recent LCD or OLED mobile displays can consume relatively large amounts of power. In addition power consumption of platform components for network transmission including wireless communications and radio level processing can also be significant. The choice of media players container formats and streaming protocols e.g. RTSP progressive download HTTP adaptive streaming etc. can significantly impact the amount of power consumption.

In today s deployments media streaming energy consumption is far from optimal. The intelligent adaptation of multimedia for media streaming and conversational services can provide important enhancements in energy power efficiency of mobile devices. Video streaming service providers device vendors and network operators can impact significantly the battery life time by selecting an optimal video player coding and container solution by delivering the content over the radio with the most energy efficient traffic model and by optimizing the radio parameters accordingly.

In one example with the availability of multiple versions of the same video content at different quality levels selecting a low quality version of the video clip can provide important savings in battery power due to a reduction in the amount of data transmitted over the wireless medium. For instance the reduced data can not only reduce the amount of bits transmitted or received it can also increase the availability of sleep cycles for a power saving mode of the mobile device. In addition the decreased amount of data in a low quality version of the video clip can decrease the amount of processing required for decoding and rendering the content. In summary there s an opportunity to design new multimedia adaptation techniques to optimize energy consumption that varies dramatically between devices services media players and video qualities.

There have been a number of multimedia standards that have been developed to enable multimedia to be communicated to from or between mobile computing devices. For instance in streaming video the third generation partnership project 3GPP has developed technical specification TS 26.234 e.g. Release 11.0.0 that describes packet switched streaming services PSS that are based on the real time streaming protocol RTSP for unicast streaming of on demand or live content. In addition hyper text transfer protocol HTTP based streaming services including progressive download and dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP DASH are described in 3GPP TS 26.247 e.g. Release 11.0.0 . 3GPP based multimedia broadcast and multicast services MBMS specification TS 26.346 e.g. Release 11.0.0 specifies streaming and download techniques for multicast broadcast content distribution. As such DASH PSS MBMS based mobile computing devices such as user equipment UEs decode and render streamed videos at the UE devices. Support for the 3GP file format in 3GPP TS 26.244 e.g. Release 11.0.0 is mandated in all of these specifications to support file download and HTTP based streaming use cases.

One example of a standard for conversational video communication such as video conferencing is provided in 3GPP TS 26.114 e.g. 11.0.0 . The standard describes the multimedia telephony services over IMS MTSI that allows delivery of advanced multimedia conversational services and content over internet protocol IP multimedia subsystems IMS based networks. IMS is standardized in 3GPP TS 26.140 e.g. Rel. 11.0.0 . An MTSI based transmitter UE terminal can capture and records video and then transfer the video to an MTSI based receiver UE terminal over a 3GPP network. The receiver UE terminal can then decode and render the video. The 3GPP TS 26.140 also enables video sharing using multimedia sharing services MMS in which support for the 3GP file format is provided.

The standards described above are provided as examples of wireless multimedia standards that can be used to communicate multimedia files to from and or between multimedia devices. The examples are not intended to be limiting. Additional standards may be used to provide streaming video conversational video or video sharing.

A more detailed explanation of HTTP streaming and more particularly the DASH standard is provided herein in context with embodiments of the present invention. The detailed explanation is not intended to be limiting. As will be further explained in the proceeding paragraphs the embodiments of the present invention can be used to efficiently communicate multimedia to from and or between mobile devices by enabling the mobile devices or the servers in communication with the mobile devices to select and or communicate multimedia having a desired energy characterization. The multimedia can be communicated using a standardized or non standardized communication scheme.

Hypertext transfer protocol HTTP streaming can be used as a form of multimedia delivery of Internet video. In HTTP streaming a multimedia file can be partitioned into one or more segments and delivered to a client using the HTTP protocol. HTTP based delivery can provide reliability and deployment simplicity due to a broad adoption of both HTTP and HTTP s underlying protocols including transmission control protocol TCP internet protocol IP . HTTP based delivery can enable simplified streaming services by avoiding network address translation NAT and firewall traversal issues. HTTP based delivery or streaming can also provide the ability to use standard HTTP servers and caches instead of specialized streaming servers. HTTP based delivery can provide scalability due to minimal or reduced state information on a server side. Examples of HTTP streaming technologies can include Microsoft IIS Smooth Streaming Apple HTTP Live Streaming and Adobe HTTP Dynamic Streaming.

DASH is a standardized HTTP streaming protocol. As illustrated in DASH can specify different formats for a media presentation description MPD metadata file that provides information on the structure and different versions of the media content representations stored in the server as well as the segment formats. The MPD metadata file contains information on the initialization and media segments for a media player e.g. the media player can look at initialization segment to determine a container format and media timing information to ensure mapping of segments into a media presentation timeline for switching and synchronous presentation with other representations. DASH technology has also been standardized by other organizations such as the Moving Picture Experts Group MPEG Open IPTV Forum OIPF and Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV HbbTV .

A DASH client can receive multimedia content by downloading the segments through a series of HTTP request response transactions. DASH can provide the ability to dynamically switch between different bit rate representations of the media content as the bandwidth that is available to a mobile device changes. Thus DASH can allow for fast adaptation to changing network and wireless link conditions user preferences and device capabilities such as display resolution the type of central processing unit CPU employed the memory resources available and so forth. The dynamic adaptation of DASH can provide a better quality of experience QoE for a user with shorter startup delays and fewer rebuffering events than other streaming protocols.

In DASH a media presentation description MPD metadata can provide information on the structure and different versions of the media content representations stored in a web media server as illustrated in . In the example illustrated in the MPD metadata is temporally divided into periods having a predetermined length such as 60 seconds in this example. Each period can include a plurality of adaptation sets . Each adaptation set can provide information about one or more media components with a number of encoded alternatives. For example adaptation set 0 in this example might include a variety of differently encoded audio alternatives such as different bit rates mono stereo surround sound and so forth. In addition to offering different quality audio for a multimedia presentation over the period ID the adaptation set may also include audio in different languages. The different alternatives offered in the adaptation set are referred to as representations .

In Adaptation set is illustrated as offering video at different bitrates such as 5 mega bits per second Mbps 2 Mbps 500 kilo bits per second kbps or a trick mode. The trick mode can be used for seeking fast forwarding rewinding or other changes in location in the multimedia streaming file. In addition the video may also be available in different formats such as two dimensional 2D or three dimensional 3D video. Each representation can include segment information . The segment information can include initialization information and the actual media segment data . In this example an MPEG 4 MP4 file is streamed from a server to a mobile device. While MP4 is used in this example a wide variety of different codecs may be used as previously discussed.

The multimedia in the adaptation set can be further divided into smaller segments. In the example of the 60 second video segment of adaptation set is further divided into four sub segments of 15 seconds each. These examples are not intended to be limiting. The actual length of the adaptation set and each media segment or sub segment is dependent on the type of media system requirements potential types of interference and so forth. The actual media segments or sub segments may have a length that is less than one second to several minutes long.

As shown in the MPD metadata information can be communicated to a client such as a mobile device. A mobile device can be a wireless device configured to receive and display streaming media. In one embodiment the mobile device may only perform part of this function such as receiving the streaming media and then communicating it to another device or a display device for rendering. The mobile device can be configured to run a client . The client can request the segments using an HTTP GET message or a series of partial GET messages. The client can control the streaming session such as managing an on time request and smooth play out of a sequence of segments or potentially adjusting bitrates or other attributes to react to changes of a wireless link a device state or a user preference.

For example a web browser of the client can request multimedia content using a HTTP GET message . The web server can provide the client with a MPD for the multimedia content. The MPD can be used to convey the index of each segment and the segment s corresponding locations as shown in the associated metadata information . The web browser can pull media from the server segment by segment in accordance with the MPD as shown in . For instance the web browser can request a first segment using a HTTP GET URL frag req . A uniform resource locator URL or universal resource locator can be used to tell the web server which segment the client is to request . The web server can provide the first fragment i.e. segment . For subsequent segments the web browser can request a segment i using a HTTP GET URL frag i req where i is an integer index of the segment. As a result the web server can provide a segment i . The segments can be presented to the client via a media decoder player .

In one embodiment in addition to the client operating on a mobile device an energy efficient metadata management and proxy server can be configured to assist in managing the amount of energy power used to encode transmit receive decode and display a multimedia stream. The metadata management and proxy server may be located in the core network such as in the evolved packet core. The proxy server may be self contained or may be located in another server such as a Mobility Management Entity MME server or a Policy and Charging Rules Function PCRF server not shown .

Alternatively the metadata management server may be configured to operate as a proxy edge server . Through inspection of device capabilities including decoding and display capabilities and content characteristics a proxy edge server may adapt the content served to its clients. For example the contents from the proxy edge server may be adapted to a client by a certain transcoding or by metadata management. For instance a DASH proxy server may decide to offer a new MPD in order to reduce available DASH representations to help UEs save power.

The newly introduced MPD attributes may also be used as part of a QoE metric reporting procedure. QoE also referred to as a quality of user experience can be a subjective measure of a customer s experiences with a service application and or multimedia delivery. QoE systems can measure metrics that a user or a customer can directly perceive as a quality parameter.

For all services a client may send a QOE report that includes information regarding the consumed energy power for decoding and rendering the received multimedia files such as video and or audio. In an embodiment the reported energy power metrics may also include the amount of energy power consumed during reception from the network including the energy power consumed in wireless reception and radio level processing.

Based on the MPD metadata information that describes the relation of the segments and how they form a media presentation a client can request the segments using HTTP GET or partial GET methods. The client can fully control the streaming session. For instance the client can manage the on time request and smooth play out of the sequence of segments at the mobile device potentially adjusting bitrates coded types frame rates resolutions and so forth to react to changes of the radio link or the user preferences.

In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention for energy efficient streaming over DASH content dependent energy or power parameters referred to herein as energy characterization information can be derived for streaming media. The term energy characterization is a determination of the amount of energy and or power it may take a mobile device to decode and display a streaming video. The energy characterization can be based on decoding and rendering complexity for each DASH representation. The energy characterization may be predetermined or determined in near real time by a video encoder a server such as a DASH server or through another desired means. In one embodiment the content dependent energy power parameters can be determined by capturing content specific information such as frame pixel histograms maximum frame pixel value block coded types deblocking filtering numbers and so forth for a bitstream. The information can then be mapped to a single energy power metric for each DASH representation.

The DASH client can then use this information to estimate the potential energy power consumption that will be incurred for each of the DASH representations. The DASH client can make selections of a DASH representation that provides desired energy metrics based on energy efficient codec processing display rendering the number of bits received and so forth.

Providing an energy characterization in a manifest file such as the MPD metadata enables a mobile device to select a best possible multimedia format based on the power available to the mobile device. For example a mobile device may be receiving a strong broadband wireless signal. Typically the strong signal may allow a media client operating on the mobile device to select the highest possible resolution such as the 5 Mbps representation in . However if the battery level is relatively low at the mobile device a representation with a lower energy characterization value may be selected to enable a user to finish watching a media presentation before the power at the mobile device is depleted. With sufficient granularity various segments or sub segments of a streaming media file may be communicated with different qualities.

For example segments of a media presentation in which there is little movement can have a higher level of encoding enabling fewer bits to be sent and less power used to decode and display the segments. Conversely segments of the media presentation with more motion or a large number of changes in the images can require a larger amount of information to communicate the image and may also use more processor power to decode and display the frequently changing images. Certain changes such as a change in the type of codec used may not even be noticeable to an end user while substantially changing the amount of power used to decode and render a streaming media file. Accordingly the media client may select a representation segment or sub segment based on the energy characterization communicated in the MPD and or the energy or power available at the mobile device.

In one embodiment a manifest file for HTTP adaptive streaming i.e. the MPD metadata information in the context of DASH can include at a representation and or sub representation level energy characterization information in addition to the typical bitrate resolution frame rate and other information that is typically sent. The energy power characterization information can be included on different encoded versions of the various media components such as the video and audio. Moreover the manifest file such as the MPD may also contain energy power characterization information across segments and sub segments of the various representations and sub representations within a period or byte range to signal variations in content energy power requirements within the media presentation in a more granular fashion to enable more dynamic adaptations in an energy efficient fashion.

The client operating on a mobile device such as the UE illustrated in can receive the manifest file i.e. MPD and request segments and sub segments corresponding to the various DASH representations. In requesting a segment or sub segment the client can take into account the energy power characterization information in the MPD. The client may switch across different representations over random access points also known as segment access points SAP in DASH by continuously tracking the power consumption in the client terminal in an effort to save battery life and optimize user quality of experience QoE .

Referring again to the DASH MPD can be configured to operate in accordance with an energy efficient adaptive streaming framework. The new MPD attributes for energy efficient streaming can be included in the MPD at a desired granularity level.

For example adaptation sets can include energy power characterization information with two new attributes a minimum energy power attribute which specifies a minimum energy power value in all representations in the adaptation set and a maximum energy power attribute that specifies a maximum energy power value in all of the representations in this adaptation set.

The minimum and maximum energy power attributes may quantify the minimum and maximum energy power levels over a specified timeline that may correspond to a period such as a period ID a segment or a sub segment . In an embodiment these values may indicate a long term or average minimum and maximum energy power measure over the entire duration of the adaptation set. In another embodiment vectorized sets of energy power values may be provided specifying the minimum and maximum energy power levels for the adaptation set across different segments and sub segments.

In another embodiment each representation may contain a new i.e. different attribute on energy power assigning an energy power value based on the content in the representation the encoding type and so forth. This value may quantify the energy power level over a specified timeline that may correspond to a period segment or sub segment . In an embodiment the energy power value may indicate a long term or average energy power measure over the entire duration of the representation. In another embodiment vectorized sets of energy power values may be provided specifying energy power levels across different segments and sub segments of the representation.

Alternatively two new attributes the minimum energy power attribute and the maximum energy power attribute may also be declared at the representation level quantifying the energy power levels over a specified timeline that may correspond to a period a segment or a sub segment . The segment information can include the energy power used in initialization of the segment as well as the power energy power used to decode and display each sub segment . In an embodiment these values may indicate long term or average minimum and maximum energy power measures over the entire duration of the representation. In another embodiment vectorized sets of energy power values may be provided specifying the minimum and maximum energy power levels across different segments and sub segments of the representation.

Each sub representation may contain a new attribute on energy power assigning an energy power value to the content in the sub representation. This value may quantify the energy power level over a specified timeline that may correspond to a period segment or sub segment. In an embodiment this value may indicate a long term or average energy power measure over the entire duration of the sub representation. In another embodiment vectorized sets of energy power values may be provided that specify energy power levels across different segments and sub segments of the sub representation.

Segments and sub segments may themselves contain new attributes describing energy power in a more granular fashion at the segment and or sub segment level. In an embodiment the energy power levels may be specified for a given byte range within a segment or sub segment. In broader terms energy power attributes may be associated with any byte range in a segment or sub segment or any byte range that spans across multiple segments or sub segments.

In addition to DASH additional standards can also be configured to enable multimedia adaptation capabilities for managing and enhancing energy efficiency of mobile devices. For example in the 3GP file format content specific energy power characterization metadata can be embedded at the 3GP file format container level. For instance the energy characterization information can be embedded when capturing uploading a video in an MMS setting thereby generating a 3GP file with embedded energy power characterization attributes. The mobile device can then use the embedded energy power characterization attributes to select and perform streaming media files based on a user preference the available power a power consumption rate at the mobile device or a combination of factors.

PSS and MBMS Content specific energy power characterization metadata can be included in the session description protocol SDP signaling for session description and capability negotiation. Moreover the real time streaming protocol RTSP signaling may include content specific energy power characterization metadata. As such the PSS and MBMS clients can understand the energy power characteristics of the incoming content and manage their decoding and display processes in a more informed way to meet a desired or predetermined power budget.

In the case of PSS the PSS client may further initiate a session re negotiation via RTSP SDP signaling in response to observing that it is running low on power. The PSS client can ask a PSS server to send different content with lower energy power requirements as previously discussed. A PSS server may perform transcoding operations in response to such a request to deliver content to the PSS client that will meet the power budget of a mobile device such as a UE terminal.

One example provides functionality of computer circuitry of a mobile device operable to provide hyper text transfer protocol HTTP adaptive streaming as shown in the flow chart in . In addition the functionality may be implemented as a method or the functionality may be executed as instructions on a machine where the instructions are included on at least one computer readable medium or one non transitory machine readable storage medium.

In the example illustrated in the computer circuitry can be configured to receive a manifest file for an HTTP adaptive stream from a node as in block identify an energy characterization in the manifest file for a plurality of representations for a selected period as in block select a representation for the selected period having a desired energy characterization as in block and request segments from the node that are in the representation having the desired energy characterization as in block .

In various different configurations the manifest file for the HTTP adaptive stream may be a media presentation description MDP for a dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP DASH adaptation set metadata embedded in a 3GP file format a session description protocol SDP in a packet switched streaming service PSS based on a real time streaming protocol RTSP or a third generation partnership program 3GPP based multimedia broadcast and multicast service MBMS or metadata embedded in the RTSP for the PSS or the MBMS.

In an example the computer circuitry is further configured to communicate to a content server via the node an energy characterization for power consumed during reception decoding or rendering of the HTTP adaptive stream. The mobile device can receive a representation having a different energy characterization from the content server based on the energy characterization reported to the content server. The computer circuitry can determine a power budget of the mobile node to decode and perform the HTTP adaptive stream. The representation selected for the selected period can have the desired energy characterization for the power budget.

In an example the computer circuitry is further configured to identify an energy characterization in the manifest file for a plurality of sub representations for the selected period and request sub segments from the node that are in at least one of the sub representations and have a desired energy characterization.

In another example the computer circuitry is further configured to switch to a different representation having a different energy characterization at a selected access point in the HTTP adaptive stream to change an amount of power consumed by the mobile device to decode and perform the HTTP adaptive stream.

Another example provides functionality of computer circuitry of a media server operable to provide hyper text transfer protocol HTTP adaptive streaming as shown in the flow chart in . In addition the functionality may be implemented as a method or the functionality may be executed as instructions on a machine where the instructions are included on at least one computer readable medium or one non transitory machine readable storage medium.

In the example illustrated in the computer circuitry can be configured to communicate energy characterization metadata to a mobile device over a byte range for a plurality of representations of an HTTP adaptive stream as in block receive a request for segments of the HTTP adaptive stream in the byte range in a representation selected from the plurality of representations wherein the representation is selected based at least in part on the energy characterization metadata as in block and communicate the requested segments in the byte range to the mobile device as in block .

In an example the computer circuitry of the embodiment of is further configured to determine the energy characterization metadata over the byte range based on content specific information comprising frame pixel histograms a maximum frame pixel value a block coded type or deblocking filtering numbers.

In an example the computer circuitry is further configured to determine a minimum and a maximum power level for segments over the byte range. The byte range can be for a period an adaptation set a representation a segment or a sub segment. In addition the computer circuitry is further configured to provide a vectorized set of energy power values to specify a minimum and a maximum energy level of each period adaptation set representation segment or sub segment in the energy characterization metadata.

In an example the manifest file for the HTTP adaptive stream is a media presentation description for a dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP DASH adaptation set metadata embedded in a 3GP file format a session description protocol SDP in a packet switched streaming service PSS based on a real time streaming protocol RTSP or a third generation partnership program 3GPP based multimedia broadcast and multicast service MBMS or metadata embedded in the RTSP for the PSS or MBMS.

In an example the computer circuitry is further configured to receive the request for segments of the HTTP adaptive stream in the byte range wherein the segments are located in an adaptation set that includes the plurality of representations and at least one representation includes a plurality of segments. Each representation can contain a same media file over the byte range that is encoded differently than other representations. The encoding can include a bit rate a frame rate a resolution or a codec type.

In an example the computer circuitry is further configured to receive a quality of experience QoE report from the mobile device that includes a power metric associated with power that is consumed at the mobile device during reception decoding or rendering of the HTTP adaptive stream and communicate a different representation to the mobile device based on the power metric received in the QoE report.

In another example the computer circuitry is further configured to receive a request for segments of the HTTP adaptive stream in the byte range in a different representation selected from the plurality of representation wherein the different representation is selected based at least in part on energy usage at the mobile device and communicate the requested segments in the byte range to the mobile device.

Video streaming typically involves communicating a video stream from a server to a mobile device. Thus power consumption concerns are typically only relevant at the receiving end at the mobile device where the streaming video is received decoded and displayed.

In contrast conversational video such as teleconferencing can occur between two mobile devices. The implementation of conversational video can be more complex since there are power consumption concerns at both the transmitting and receiving devices. Accordingly there are power consumption concerns regarding the encoding and transmitting of multimedia streams as well as the reception decoding and rendering of the multimedia streams.

In one embodiment a single mobile device may be assigned to determine the encoding and decoding levels for two or more mobile devices participating in a conversational video stream. In another embodiment a device with the lowest power may be selected to determine the encoding and decoding. Since the encoding level at a transmitter determines the decoding level at the receiver and vice versa the encoding and decoding decisions are linked. Thus the device with the lowest power i.e. a low battery level may designate a lower level of encoding and therefore decoding at both ends of a two way video conference. The same may also be true for a multi way conversational video stream between a plurality of mobile devices.

One standard that can include energy power characterization metrics for use in conversational video is the multimedia telephony services over IMS MTSI . When using MTSI content specific energy power characterization metadata can be included in the session description protocol SDP signaling for a session description and capability negotiation between a transmitting mobile device and a receiving mobile device as illustrated in . The session initiation protocol SIP signaling may also include content specific energy power characterization metadata SIP serves as the application layer control protocol to establish modify and terminate conversational multimedia sessions such as video conferences Internet telephony calls etc. .

Furthermore the SDP signaling can also include energy power characterization metadata with regards to content capturing and encoding complexity. Therefore the UEs acting as MTSI transmitter and MTSI receiver terminals can use the new SDP attributes on the energy power characterization metadata for decoding and rendering complexity as well as for capturing and encoding complexity. The energy power characterization metadata can be used to negotiate the MTSI session parameters and determine the appropriate content to be exchanged between the UEs during the conversational video session e.g. via SIP SDP signaling procedures.

An exemplary illustration for such signaling is provided in . A SIP Invite with SDP offer is sent from the MTSI transmitter UE to the MTSI Receiver UE. The SDP can include energy power metrics as previously discussed. The MTSI receiver UE can respond with an SIP K acknowledgement with SDP negotiation data that includes energy power characterization metrics for the MTSI Receiver UE. The MTSI Transmitter UE can then send an SIP ACK to the MTSI Receiver UE.

In one embodiment an MTSI based transmitter UE terminal i.e. User A s UE can capture and records video and transfer the video to the MTSI based receiver UE terminal i.e. User B s UE over the 3GPP network. The receiver UE terminal can then decode and render the video.

In MTSI the session initiation protocol SIP serves as the application layer control protocol to establish modify and terminate conversational multimedia sessions such as video conferences Internet telephony calls etc. Session description protocol SDP based signaling between the sending and receiving terminals allow for offer answer considerations in the media related capability negotiation including codecs bitrates resolutions etc. The transport of media in MTSI is based on the real time transport protocol RTP specified by IETF RFC 3550 over UDP IP.

In one example a transmit mobile device and a receive mobile device can be configured to perform conversational video. The transmit mobile device can determine a power budget of the transmit mobile device to encode and transmit the real time transport protocol RTP adaptive stream to the receive mobile device. The transmit mobile device can then transmit an offer manifest file including a plurality of energy characterizations for real time transport protocol RTP adaptive streams to be communicated to the receive mobile device. A receive mobile device can receive an offer manifest file for an RTP adaptive stream to be communicated from the transmit mobile device. The receive mobile device can determine a power budget of the receive mobile device to receive and decode the RTP adaptive stream communicated from the transmit device. The receive mobile device can identify an energy characterization in the offer manifest file for a desired RTP stream to receive from the transmit mobile device. The receive mobile device can signal the selected RTP stream in an answer manifest file to the transmit mobile device. The receive mobile device can receive the RTP stream corresponding to the selected energy characterization from the transmit mobile device.

Another example provides functionality of computer circuitry of a transmit mobile device operable to perform conversational video with a receive mobile device as shown in the flow chart in . The functionality may be implemented as a method or the functionality may be executed as instructions on a machine where the instructions are included on at least one computer readable medium or one non transitory machine readable storage medium.

In the example illustrated in the computer circuitry can be configured to transmit an offer manifest file including a plurality of energy characterizations for real time transport protocol RTP adaptive streams to the receive mobile device as in block e as in block and transmit the selected RTP stream to the receive mobile device corresponding to the selected energy characterization as in block .

A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays programmable array logic programmable logic devices or the like.

Modules may also be implemented in software for execution by various types of processors. An identified module of executable code may for instance comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions which may for instance be organized as an object procedure or function. Nevertheless the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which when joined logically together comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module.

Indeed a module of executable code may be a single instruction or many instructions and may even be distributed over several different code segments among different programs and across several memory devices. Similarly operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data may be collected as a single data set or may be distributed over different locations including over different storage devices and may exist at least partially merely as electronic signals on a system or network. The modules may be passive or active including agents operable to perform desired functions.
