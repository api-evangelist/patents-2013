title: Controlling a paravirtualized wireless interface from a guest virtual machine
abstract: A method, system and an apparatus to paravirtualize a wireless interface is disclosed. In one embodiment, a method receives a frame of data for a wireless service through a wireless interface of a host device using a processor. If the frame of data is associated with a first type of category, the frame of data is processed through a first standard interface. If the frame of data is associated with a second type of category, the frame is processed through a second standard interface. The method then sends the frame of data processed through the first standard interface or the second standard interface to a guest. A virtual wireless interface associated the guest that is emulating the wireless interface of the host device converts the frame of data processed through the first standard interface to the second standard of communication.
