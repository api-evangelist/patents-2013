The disclosure relates to systems and methods for nondestructive inspection operated beyond line of sight and in limited access areas and more particularly for systems and methods for nondestructive inspection utilizing an instrumented arm equipped with an end effector.

Inspection of limited access areas within enclosures such as aircraft structures may require disassembly and reassembly of the structure which is costly and time consuming. As an alternative such enclosed areas may include an access opening sized to receive a sensor or other instrument that enables a visual inspection. If the interior to be inspected is relatively open use of such a sensor may be effective. However in many applications such an enclosure may include an obstructed interior that may include hardware or other structure that makes access and inspection difficult.

For example certain internal aircraft structures may require in service inspection but such structures may be obstructed by tubes brackets and actuators that must be removed first. In some cases initial inspections may take more than 1000 hours and subsequent inspections may take more than 500 hours. Other internal aircraft components may be obstructed by other structural elements. Because of structural removal issues an initial aircraft inspection may take more than 2000 hours and recurring inspections as much as 1100 hours.

Currently such inspections may be performed using borescopes and remote cameras shaped to be inserted into limited access areas. Such devices may be able to see surface flaws or damage but not subsurface damage. In many cases features found using these devices and methods may be misdiagnosed as damage and only determined to be benign markings after costly disassembly. Fatigue inspections of titanium attach fittings on aircraft may be programmed as visual borescope inspections but if crack like indications are found there is no current method of confirming them other than simply disassembly of the empennage.

Further with the increase in use of bonded and co cured composite structures for aircraft access to the interior for production and in service inspection may be very difficult costly and time consuming. Such inspection may be so expensive that certain lower cost structure designs cannot be utilized because of the high cost of performing in service inspections.

Accordingly there is a need for a system and method for nondestructive inspection in limited enclosed areas. There is also a need for a system and method for nondestructive testing that tracks the position and orientation of an inspection device in a confined space.

In an embodiment a multi axis tool that may include a gimbal adapted to be positioned adjacent an opening in a wall an extended reach device having first and second ends and an end effector adjacent the first end the extended reach device engaging the gimbal for relative rotational movement and relative slidable movement through the opening such that the end effector is positioned on a side of the wall opposite the second end a sensor system configured to measure a linear position of the extended reach device relative to the gimbal and a position and spatial orientation of the end effector relative to the opening and a computer control connected to receive signals from the sensor system to determine at least one of the position and orientation of the end effector relative to the opening.

In another embodiment a method for inspecting an interior of an enclosure the enclosure having a wall with an access opening the method may include providing an extended reach device having first and second ends and an end effector adjacent the first end inserting the extended reach device through the opening such that the end effector is positioned on the side of the wall opposite the second end detecting with a sensor system a position and spatial orientation of the end effector relative to the opening and determining a position and orientation of the end effector relative to the opening.

Other objects and advantages of the present disclosure will be apparent from the following description the accompanying drawings and the appended claims.

As shown in the disclosed tracking enabled multi axis tool generally designated may include an extended reach device having a first end and a second end . The first end may include an end effector generally designated . The second end may include a handle shaped to be grasped and manipulated by a user not shown . The extended reach device may include a sensor system which in the embodiment of may include an inertial measurement unit IMU that may be connected to a computer control generally designated that may include an encoder reading device .

The sensor system also may include string encoder . The string encoder may communicate with the encoder reading device and having a cable attached to a gimbal which in the embodiment of may be a slider ball mounted on the extended reach device . Thus the string encoder may measure the linear position of the extended reach device relative to the slider ball . Optionally or in addition to string encoder a laser measurement device LMD may be mounted on the handle of the extended reach device . As will be described in detail both string encoder and LMD may be used by computer control to determine the length of the extended reach device that is beyond the slider ball in order to locate the end of the extended reach device.

The extended reach device also may include a camera mounted adjacent the first end and a second laser measurement device LMD . The camera may be connected to the computer control either by wires or wirelessly so that an object viewed by the camera may appear on a display .

The extended reach device generally may be elongate in shape and sized such that the first end may be inserted through an access opening in a wall so that the first end may be placed in an enclosed inspection space see also on a side of wall opposite the second end and handle .

The slider ball may be positioned adjacent the access opening and attached to or otherwise fixed relative to the wall . Since the IMU is mounted on the extended reach device it tracks the orientation of the extended reach device of the tool which may be equivalent to tracking orientation for any part of the tool that may be rigidly attached to the shaft of the extended reach device. Signals generated by the IMU indicative of the orientation of the shaft may be received by the computer control .

With the embodiment of the data from IMU may be used to measure orientation of shaft . The distance measurement of the shaft relative to the access opening may be acquired from a variety of sources such as the string encoder . Alternately or in addition the end effector may utilize the LMD to track the insertion of the end effector device relative to a known inspection location .

As shown in with this multi axis tool the result of data input from the IMU and the string encoder and or the LMD may be a 4 4 homogenous transformation matrix that encodes the position and orientation of the first end of the shaft of the end effector relative to a reference coordinate system designated R shown in . The coordinate system of the camera is designated Rin . The reference frame of the camera R will remain fixed relative to the reference frame of the IMU Rbecause both the IMU and camera are mounted on the shaft . Consequently the orientation of the IMU which may be communicated to the computer control will indicate the orientation of the camera .

The distance L from the IMU to the camera which is a known distance is expressed as the sum of the distance Lfrom the IMU to the slider ball which is indicative of the distance from the IMU to the wall and the distance Lfrom the slider ball to the camera . Accordingly the distance from the inspection opening to the object viewed by the camera may be expressed as the difference between the total length L and the length Lfrom the IMU to the inspection opening . This distance may also be calculated or determined by measuring the distance from the LMD to a known reference object within the interior . These measurements may be updated continuously in real time as the extended reach device is manipulated by an operator not shown .

In an embodiment a 3D visualization application may be used to show on display a CAD based display of the environment in the field of view of the camera . The 3D environment may be used to help guide the user and keep track of the inspection sequence. For example locations of specific areas of interest may be highlighted in one color while areas that have been inspected or may still need to be inspected may be shown in other colors. In addition a representation of the tool may be shown operating in a virtual environment as well see e.g. since the position and orientation of the tool are known from the tracking instrumentation IMU string encoder and LMD . Accordingly as shown in as camera views object the display may show a virtual representation of the object that is generated by the 3D visualization application. If the LMD is utilized the distance data it provides may be used with the relative orientation of the end effector to create a transformation matrix to post multiply the transformation of the shaft . This provides the location of the laser intersection point with the target object and is computed in the same manner as the relative camera view transformation described above.

The 3D visualization application has an architecture that allows external applications to modify the position and orientation information for the virtual camera or other objects in the 3D environment. In some applications this may be accomplished using a plug in framework that has an application programming interface API to allow control of the visualization environment from a separate application.

In an embodiment the tool may include a display that may be used in addition to or instead of display . This display may show a virtual image of the object alongside an actual camera image of the object . This side by side display may enable a user to compare the actual object with the virtual object which may enable the operator to detect a defect or other problem with the viewed object. Data and images of the objects as well as the contours and other objects in the inspection space that may enable the 3D visualization application to display virtual images that move as the camera moves with movement of the extended reach device may be stored in a database that may be part of computer control or may be accessed by computer control from a remote location not shown .

As shown in in another embodiment which may or may not be used in combination with the embodiment shown in a portable display device A such as a tablet PC shown a smartphone DisplayLink monitor a wearable a hand held device or a heads up display may be equipped with a separate IMU and used to provide virtual viewpoint orientation control. The virtual viewpoint position may be linked to the fixed location of the access port or any location associated with the tool A for example the first end of the tool. Consequently any rotation pivoting or angling of the display device A and IMU will result in a corresponding rotation pivoting or angling of the virtual image A. This capability may allow for a more intuitive interface and provide improved situational awareness for the user. If the display device A is equipped with a touchscreen display A objects may selected on the screen and positions recorded for further analysis.

Another embodiment of the multi axis tool B is shown in . With this embodiment the sensor system which in the embodiment of included IMU and slider ball may be replaced or augmented by a system of linear and rotational encoders used to track movements of the extended reach device . The multi axis tool B may include a gimbal that includes parallel slides blocks rail and sliding attachment ring positioned adjacent the opening in the wall .

Parallel slides may extend in length and may be attached to the wall by means such as clamps suction cups screws and the like not shown on either side of inspection opening . Slides may include longitudinal slots respectively that receive blocks for relative slidable movement in the direction of arrow A. The rail may be attached to the blocks for relative rotational movement in the direction of arrow B. The rail may extend between the slides across inspection opening . The sliding attachment ring may be mounted on the rail for relative slidable or translational movement in the direction of arrow C and be mounted for pivotal movement in the direction of arrow D i.e. about an axis normal to the rail on the rail. Further the shaft of extended reach device may engage the sliding attachment ring for relative slidable movement in the direction of arrow E and relative rotational movement in the direction of arrow F.

As shown in rail may include a linear encoder located at to transmit a signal indicative of the position of block relative to rail in the direction of arrow A and block may include a rotational encoder located at that may transmit a signal indicative of the relative rotation angle of slide to block in the direction of arrow B . Slide may include a linear encoder located at that may transmit a signal indicative of the position of sliding attachment ring relative to the rail in the direction of arrow C and sliding attachment ring may include rotational encoders located at for transmitting signals indicative of a pivotal orientation of the sliding attachment ring in the direction of arrow D and the rotational position of the shaft in the direction of arrow F respectively. The signals from the encoders all may be transmitted to the computer control to give an indication of the orientation of the end effect tool relative to the opening . These signals may be processed by the computer control to generate a virtual and or actual image respectively of the object being viewed. The embodiment of may eliminate the need for IMU . However string encoder or LDM still may be necessary to detect the in and out motion of the shaft of the extended reach device relative to the inspection opening in the direction of arrow E .

As shown in the shaft B of the extended reach device A may include a hollow interior that receives a tube that is also hollow and receives a ring magnet or ferromagnetic disk A within it. The tube may be attached to an interior wall of the shaft B by an adhesive bonding or other means. The sliding attachment ring A may include a magnet or metal disk if the disk A is comprised of magnetic material . The magnetic attraction between the ring magnet or disk A and ring may maintain the magnet or disk A in the position shown in as the shaft B is moved longitudinally in the direction of arrow E shown in relative to sliding attachment ring A. Again this relative movement may cause the cable either to be drawn into the string encoder B or extended from it thus generating a signal indicative of the relative longitudinal position of the shaft B to sliding attachment ring A. An advantage of including the hollow tube within the interior of shaft B is that clearance may be provided for other wires and cable to extend along the interior. Such wires and cables may include connections to the LMD and or camera .

As shown in the shaft C has a hollow interior that provides a conduit for other wires and cables generally designated to extend through it. The sliding attachment ring C itself may be connected by the cable to the string encoder C. Relative longitudinal movement of the shaft C of the extended reach device C in the direction of arrow E may cause the cable to be withdrawn into or extended outwardly from the string encoder C thereby indicating the relative position of the shaft C to the sliding attachment ring C.

In yet another embodiment shown in the tracking enabled multi axis tool generally designated may include a gimbal in the form of a tilt swivel support system in place of for example the IMU encoder and slider ball components of the embodiment of . Tilt swivel may include a support that may include a stand not shown or an attachment not shown to wall . A shaft is pivotally mounted on support and includes a U shaped bracket so that the shaft and U shaped bracket swivel relative to the support about a vertical axis as shown in . A block is shaped to fit between and may be pivotally attached to the arms of the U shaped bracket . Arm may include an arcuate slot that receives threaded stud on which a locking knob is mounted to provide an adjustable friction resistance to pivotal movement of the block relative to the bracket .

The block may include a bore shaped to slidably and rotationally receive the shaft of the extended reach device . A wheel encoder may be mounted on the support and include a wheel that engages shaft . Wheel may be oriented to rotate in response to rotation of the shaft and thus encoder may detect swivel movement of U shaped bracket and thus swivel movement of shaft . A wheel encoder may be mounted on arm and include wheel positioned to engage the block . Wheel is oriented to rotate in response to pivotal movement of the block and thus elevational movement of the shaft as it pivots relative to the bracket .

A wheel encoder may be mounted on block and include a wheel that extends through a slot in the block to contact shaft . Wheel is oriented such that it is rotated in response to longitudinal movement of shaft relative to block and therefore to system . A wheel encoder may be mounted on block and include a wheel that extends through slot in block to engage shaft . Wheel is oriented such that it rotated in response to rotational movement of the shaft relative to block so that encoder may detect rotational movement of shaft relative to system .

Since wheels and are mounted so that they measure different motions translation and rotation respectively of shaft wheels and may be omni wheels that allow the surface on which they are rolling to slide freely in the direction perpendicular to their respective rotation directions.

Encoders and each may be connected to send a signal to computer control . Consequently computer control may receive signals indicative of a location of distil end of shaft by calculating the longitudinal rotational tilting and swivel movements of the shaft as measured by encoders and .

In operation a user may input to the computer control identification information pertaining to the aircraft or other enclosure to be inspected and may input identification indicia of the inspection opening . This information may enable the computer control to access the appropriate library of data for the enclosure to be inspected. With the embodiment of the user may attach the slider ball in position at or near the inspection opening . With the embodiment of the user may attach the slides adjacent to the inspection opening . At this point the user may be positioned on the outside of wall and will not be able to see through the inspection opening .

The user or an assistant then may manipulate the extended reach device by grabbing the handle such that the distil end of the shaft passes through the inspection opening and enters the inspection space . The user may view an actual or virtual image on display or of the inspection space . The user may manipulate the extended reach device so that the camera is oriented to view a desired object . With the embodiment of signals from the IMU and one or both the string encoder and LMD may be utilized by the computer control to determine the location and orientation of the end effector relative to the inspection opening . With the embodiment of the computer control may receive signals from the encoders and string encoder to determine the location and orientation of the end effector relative to the inspection opening . Thus the computer control may display the appropriate virtual image at the appropriate orientation relative to the extended reach device .

If the object includes a defect the defect may appear on the image . The user may actuate the computer control which may be by touching a touch screen display to make a note of the location of the defect and may actuate the computer control to record the image showing the object and defect . Once the inspection is completed the computer control may generate a report of the image and or location of the object and defect . The inspection may be facilitated by use of the portable device A. The portable device may receive information relating to the relevant aircraft and location of the inspection opening and access stored information either locally on the device A or remotely and display an image A of the objects being inspected . This image may be manipulated by manipulating the spatial orientation of the device A to enable a user to visualize the inspection space and the position of the extended reach device within it.

The foregoing embodiments each provide a multi axis tool that has the ability to track the position and orientation of the end effector on an extension arm that operates in a confined space. Further the embodiments enable a user to visualize a virtual representation of the environment being inspected from the perspective of the end effector. This may allow an operator of the tool to have a better situational awareness of the inspection volume. In that environment a user may view in certain embodiments 3D models of all the aircraft components or other components being inspected in the inspection region as well as visualize the inspection tool and even a representation of the view region frustum of the video camera on the end effector.

This type of interaction with the physical environment of the objects being viewed with virtual representations of the same physical objects may be facilitated by the ability to track position and orientation of the end effector when registered with the coordinate system of the target object. Objects in some embodiments may be highlighted in one color to show a user which items need to be scanned and in another color to show those items that already have been scanned. In other embodiments additional information about the objects and environment may be displayed in a properly registered 3D context. In still other embodiments the computer control may generate reports of the scanning session in which 3D data points are recorded by the control as a way to confirm that required areas have been scanned.

The forms of apparatus and methods described herein are not exclusive of the inventions covered by this disclosure and variations may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention.
