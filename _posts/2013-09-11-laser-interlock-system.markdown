The United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to the employer employee relationship between the inventors and the U.S. Department of Energy operators of the National Energy Technology Laboratory NETL .

The present invention relates to a laser interlock system preferably for the safe discontinuance of optical energy when a high power laser is moved or disconnected from its designated location.

There has been significant progress in the production of high intensity optical energy for example in the area of laser spark plugs or cutting technology and laser based missile defense. However there has been little effort to protect users of such systems from accidental exposure to such high intensity optical energy that may blind or otherwise severely injure anyone exposed to such optical energy without proper protection.

Typically high intensity optical energy systems use a simple case switch which is a simple electrical switch that is opened or closed when a casing is opened. However in some systems it may be difficult or impractical to have a case switch to indicate when an outer casing is removed. For example for laser spark plugs providing a casing around each plug would be impractical and lead to spacing issues heat issues etc. Furthermore such a sensor does little to follow the path of optical energy from the source. For example unlike electricity simple cuts in an optical fiber covering may do more than just cause disconnections or electrical shorts but may leak dangerous amounts of high intensity optical energy. Such high intensity leaks may be particularly dangerous as they may be undetectable in current designs until damage or injury occurs.

For embodiments using a first filter as the first filter is substantially opaque to optical energy from the first optical source optical energy reaching the detector will be substantially transmitted preferably entirely from the second optical source.

In the alternative the first filter may be omitted. In this embodiment the detector interlock control system or a combination thereof is designed to isolate the optical energy from the second optical source.

The interlock control system is connected to the means for producing dangerous optical energy and configured to terminate optical energy production of the means for producing dangerous optical energy upon the detection of optical energy at the detector from the second optical source below a predetermined detector threshold. The interlock control system receives a signal from the detector relating to the presence of optical energy at the detector. Preferably the signal relates to the amount of optical energy detected. In an alternate embodiment using a first filter to filter out all optical energy except for the optical energy from the second optical source the detector provides only whether or not optical energy is detected whereby the predetermined detector threshold is the detection capability of the detector configuration.

The interlock control system will then determine whether or not the determined value is below a predetermined detector threshold. The interlock control system anticipates an optical energy is coming from the second source which is transformed into an electrical signal by the detector.

Preferably the predetermined detector threshold is optimized at design.

Preferably the means for producing dangerous optical energy is any means for producing energy that may cause harm to unprotected humans animals or other life forms electrical components or surrounding materials.

Preferably the means for producing dangerous optical energy is a high power optical source. In yet another embodiment for example as shown in the means for producing dangerous optical energy is a Laser Light Generator configured to act as both the second optical source providing optical energy towards the detector in response to optical energy from the first optical source as well as provide a dangerous optical energy in response to pumping provided by optical energy from the first optical source. The system is design whereby the detector will not be confused by optical energy produced by the means for producing dangerous optical energy or any other optical energy produced during normal operations. For example in one preferred embodiment the means for producing dangerous optical energy operates at a different wavelength polarity modulation or a combination thereof than light produced by the second optical source.

In another embodiment the means for producing dangerous optical energy is a high power optical source preferably a Q switched Nd YAG laser and the first optical source is a modulated Nd YAG laser that the detector interlock control system or a combination thereof can differentiate from the optical energy produced by the second optical source.

Preferably the means for producing dangerous optical energy is a laser spark plug more preferably a Q switched spark plug.

In an alternate embodiment the means for producing dangerous optical energy is continuous wave high powered laser used for cutting welding or etching solid materials such as paper leather cloth glass metal wood plastic or such material needing to be cut welded or etched.

Preferably the means for producing dangerous optical energy has a wavelength polarity modulation or a combination thereof to prevent interference with the interlock system. For embodiments using a polarization reflector the means for producing dangerous optical energy is preferably a different wavelength that is blocked by the first filter or the same wavelength at the polarization of the first optical source. In yet another embodiment whereby the second optical source is a fluorescent material the means for producing dangerous optical energy emits optical energy at a wavelength different than the wavelength of the optical energy produced by the second optical source.

In various embodiments a plurality of second optical sources may be employed. Preferably the first optical source first beam splitter optical path detector interlock control system means for producing dangerous optical energy or a combination thereof may be reused providing functionality to a plurality of second optical sources. For example in one embodiment a single means for producing dangerous optical energy is protected with a plurality of second optical sources that may or may not reuse the other various components.

In a preferred embodiment for example but not limited to as described below a single first optical source first beam splitter optical path detector interlock control system means for producing dangerous optical energy are all used to provide interlock monitoring as described herein of multiple second optical sources. In this embodiment the second optical source produces a modulated response unique form the other modulated responses of the second optical source. Therefore the detector interlock control system or a combination thereof may determine the second optical source producing the optical energy received at the detector and detect a disconnect thereby disabling the appropriate means for producing dangerous optical energy.

As shown in and described above the first optical source produces an optical energy along the optical path . The first beam splitter passes a portion of optical energy from the first optical source to the second optical source and reflects a portion of optical energy from the first optical source away from the detector .

Optical energy from the first optical source passing through the first beam splitter to the second optical source creates an optical response resulting in the optical energy from the second optical source being transmitted back towards the first beam splitter . A portion of the optical energy from the second optical source having reflected from the first beam splitter will substantially pass to the detector . The interlock control system detects the presence of optical energy from the second optical source at detector . If the interlock control system detects a lack of optical energy at the detector from the second optical source indicating the optical path has been interrupted the operation of the high power optical source is terminated. If the interlock control system detects optical energy at the detector from the second optical source indicating the optical path is intact the operation of the high power optical source is allowed to proceed as desired.

Preferably the interlock control system is connected to the detector and the high power optical source via one or more wires. A wire is any electrically conductive means. In one embodiment the interlock control system is connected to the detector and the high power optical source via a common bus preferably wired but in the alternative wireless.

Therefore if the optical path between the first optical source first beam splitter second optical source or any combination thereof is blocked or otherwise attenuated the interlock control system will terminate operation of the high power optical source upon the detection of optical energy at the detector below the predetermined detector threshold.

The optical path is the path of optical energy from the first optical source to the second optical source . Although the optical path is depicted as a linear path the path of optical energy from the first optical source may take any path. In various embodiments the optical path comprises one or more mirrors optical fibers lenses other optical devices or any combination thereof. For example but not limited to in one embodiment the optical path incorporates one or more optical fibers whereby the path may include various bends and turns at any angle. In another embodiment the optical path includes one or more mirrors or other means of reflecting thereby allowing for various optical paths as desired.

The first protected output includes the second optical source and the high power optical source . Although only one first protected output is shown in any number of protected outputs may be used. In one embodiment the first protected output also includes the first optical source the first beam splitter the optical path the detector the interlock system or a combination thereof.

The first filter as described above is positioned between the first beam splitter and the detector . All optical energy passing to the detector is preferably passed through the first filter . The first filter is made of a material which substantially blocks the optical energy of the first optical source from passing to the detector while substantially allowing optical energy from the second optical source to pass through. In this embodiment a portion of the optical energy from the second optical source having reflected from the first beam splitter will substantially pass through the first filter to the detector . Therefore optical energy reaching the detector is substantially from the second optical source . In the alternative the first filter may be omitted for example but not limited to when the response of the second optical source is modulated or otherwise distinguishable by the detector interlock control system or a combination thereof.

The embodiment shown in also has an optical window connected to the second optical source and the high power optical source . In one embodiment the optical window also serves as a lens. This embodiment is preferred for systems having the high power optical output of the high power optical source directed within a reaction chamber for example but not limited to a laser spark plug directed into a combustion cylinder. In this embodiment the second optical source is preferably a film on the surface of the optical window preferably by etching or otherwise an integral part of the optical window or near the portion of the optical window where the high power source output passes preferably embedded beside or otherwise near the optical window . In the alternative the optical window comprises a portion that is made of a material that acts as the second optical source as described above. This embodiment preferably comprises a means for separating the high power optical source from the optical window whereby upon separation the second optical source is also separated from the first optical source thereby activating the interlock as described above.

The first section holds at least the high power optical source . In various embodiments other components may also be positioned within the first section . Preferably a plug is used to at least allow for the passage of the optical path to the second optical source as well as any connections between the interlock control system and the high power optical source . In a preferred embodiment the first section is the chassis of a laser spark plug.

The second section holds at least the second optical source . In various embodiments other components may also be positioned within the second section . Preferably the second section also includes the optical window whereby the second section forms a sealed chamber preferably for use in a laser spark plug or other closed area. Preferably the second section is properly sealed to contain the output of the high power optical source .

The first section and the second connection are preferably removably fastened to each other in a manner allowing for separation during repair preferably via a screwed latched bolted tied nailed otherwise fastening means or a combination thereof.

The plug is preferably used to at least allow for the passage of the optical path within the first section and eventually to the second optical source as well as any connections between the interlock control system and the high power optical source . In a more preferred embodiment the plug provides a means for connecting and disconnecting the various connections passing into and out of the first section . The plug is used at least to allow optical energy from the first optical source to pass to the second optical source and the interlock control system to connect to the high power optical source . In this embodiment if the first optical source is disconnected at the plug the interlock system will activate as described above thereby terminating the high power optical source . This embodiment is preferable as it allows for a quick means of connecting. This embodiment is even more preferred for systems having a high power optical output directed within a chamber for example but not limited to a laser spark plug.

The use of a first section with the second section is particularly advantageous for various reasons for example but not limited to it allows for the device to be separated for example but not limited to during repairs or during regular use while providing enhanced safety.

For example but not limited to during normal operation when the first section is connected to the second section the output of the high power optical source will be preferably contained by the second section .

If the first section is separated from the second section the interlock system will detect a lack of optical energy from the second optical source at the detector as described above and disable the high power optical source . This is particularly important as the output of the high power optical source would be otherwise uncontained. The system is advantageous over an electrical system using switches as it uses the above discussed optical detection means which closely matches the optical coupling of the high power optical source . Therefore the system is able to not only detect a complete separation of the first section and the second section but an improper coupling for example but not limited to by the sections being shifted slightly or being separated by a relatively small gap which would be difficult to detect using non optical connections while emitting dangerous optical energy from the high power optical source .

Furthermore one embodiment of the above described system is also resistant against failures caused by degradation of the optical window due to stresses caused by wear and tear or unexpected stresses due to explosions reactions etc. If the optical window were to deteriorate the second optical source would also deteriorate and at least reflect significantly less of the optical energy from the first optical source that can be detected by the detector . Therefore it is also preferred that the second optical source is a film on the optical window whereby any damage to the optical window would also likely affect the performance of the second optical source .

The configuration is particularly beneficial as if any of the optical energy passing through the optical path is blocked or otherwise attenuated for example but not limited to by a breaking of an optical fiber the interlock system will detect a lack of optical energy at the detector as described above and disable the high power optical source . Therefore a plug is preferably used to at least allow for the passage of the optical path to the second optical source as well as any connections between the interlock control system and the high power optical source . In a preferred embodiment the first section is the chassis of a laser spark plug.

Furthermore if the plug or any other device includes a preferable disconnect connect means if the plug is disconnected the interlock system will detect a lack of optical energy at the detector as described above and disable the high power optical source .

The polarized optical source creates an optical energy having low peak power preferably less than 10 Watts more preferably less than about 1 Watt. Preferably the optical energy produced by the polarized optical source is a continuous stream or a periodic pulse. In the preferred embodiment the polarizing optical source is a laser diode preferably providing a continuous optical energy that is detected by the detector.

The polarizing optical source provides an optical energy at a first polarization. In a preferred embodiment the polarizing optical source comprises a polarizer preferably an optical filter that passes optical energy of a specific polarization and blocks waves of other polarizations. Preferably the polarized optical source has a different wavelength than or the same polarization as the optical energy from the high power optical source .

The polarization filter is substantially opaque to optical energy at the first polarization. The polarization filter is substantially translucent to optical energy at the second polarization. Preferably the polarization filter is also substantially opaque to optical energy having a wavelength different from the polarizing optical source preferably through the use of a wavelength specific filter.

Preferably the polarization filter is a wire grid polarizer absorptive polarizers e.g. using a crystal such as tourmaline beam splitting polarizer polarization by reflection birefringent polarizer thin film polarizer other polarization device or any combination thereof.

The polarization rotating reflector reflects optical energy at the first polarization to a second polarization. Preferably the second polarization is about 90 degrees from the first polarization.

In one embodiment the second optical source includes a waveplate and a thin film mirror designed to cause a reflection and preferably a 90 degree rotation of polarization. Preferably the waveplate is about inch thick. Preferably the wave plate is made of Calcite Mica crystalline Quartz or a combination thereof. Preferably the mirror is made of fused quartz with a vapor deposited coating either metallic or otherwise. Preferably the mirror is coated with aluminum or silver for cost effectiveness.

In one embodiment the second optical source or a combination of the optical path and second optical source uses a plurality of mirrors which change the direction of polarization to any direction whereby the reflect of light by each mirror produces a final result at the second optical source of a 90 degree rotation of the polarization from the optical energy produced by the first optical source.

The excitation optical source is any optical source capable of producing an optical response from the fluorescent material . Preferably the excitation optical source is an optical source as described above for the first optical source.

The fluorescent material is any material that produces an optical energy in response to optical energy from the excitation optical source . Preferably the fluorescent material is a solid state laser materials such as Nd YAG Cr YAG Nd YVO Nd glass Ruby Alexandrite Ti Sapphire Nd YALO Er YAG Yb YAG Er YSGG Nd YLF Er YLF Ho YLF Tm YLF Cr Nd YSGG Cr Er YSGG Cr Ho Tm YSGG Cr Fosterite Nd KGW Er KGW TGG Er YVO Yb YVO Cr Yb Er glass Nd Yb Er glass Yb glass Er glass fluorite calcite gypsum ruby talc opal agate quartz amber a substrate impregnated with a dye a phosphorescent crystal or combinations thereof.

The first protected output and the second protected output are connected to the first beam splitter using the same optical fiber or different optical fibers. In one embodiment the optical path is split at the first beam splitter . In another embodiment the optical path is split after the first beam splitter using a first beam splitter or other means of splitting the optical energy.

In this embodiment the second optical source e.g. the fluorescent material shown in of the first protected output produces a different polarity wavelength or modulation or combination thereof whereby the detector the interlock control system or a combination thereof is capable of distinguishing the optical energy from the first protected output and the second protected output received at the detector . This embodiment is advantageous as the excitation optical source the first beam splitter the detector and the interlock control system are used to monitor multiple points reducing the number of components and thereby reducing cost and complexity.

In a preferred embodiment the first protected output produces a different wavelength preferably by having a different fluorescent material than the wavelength produced by the second protected output whereby the detector interlock control system or combination thereof includes the ability to determine the wavelength of light received for example but not limited to by calculating a Fourier transformation. In an alternate embodiment the first protected output produces modulated output different including a lack of modulation preferably by having a second optical source than the output produced by the second protected output whereby the detector interlock control system or combination thereof includes the ability to determine the modulation or lack thereof of light received. In yet another alternate embodiment the first protected output produces an output having a different polarity preferably by having a second optical source than the output produced by the second protected output whereby the detector interlock control system or combination thereof includes the ability to determine the polarity of light received for example but not limited to using a second detector optically connected to the first beam splitter and polarization filters blocking different polarizations reaching the first and second detectors.

As shown the pumping source is optically connected to the optical path preferably using the same optical components as the optical energy from the first optical source . In the embodiment shown in the pumping source is optically connected to the optical path before the first beam splitter although this optical connect may occur anywhere along the optical path . The first optical source and the pumping source may be connected to the optical path using any optical coupling means for example any number of lenses reflectors and combinations thereof. In a preferred embodiment a beam splitter as described above is used to optically connect the first optical source and the pumping source along the optical path . In one embodiment the optical path is split at the first beam splitter . In another embodiment the optical path is split after the first beam splitter using a first beam splitter or other means of splitting the optical energy.

This embodiment having a first optical source and a second pumping source is preferable over having a single optical source as having a separate first optical source allows for a more continuous monitoring not affecting or bound by the pumping cycle of the Laser Light Generator and the pumping source . This embodiment is also preferable as it also minimizes the release of high power optical energy as depending on the excitation of the Laser Light Generator and its configuration the media may be only one pump pulse away from lasing for example for a nearly saturated passively Q switched Laser Light Generator media.

The pumping source is as described for the first optical source above that is preferably optimized for the excitation of the optically connected Laser Light Generator . Although the pumping source is shown as being inserted before the first beam splitter the pumping source may alternately be inserted anywhere along the optical path for example after the first beam splitter .

The second beam splitter is as described above for the first beam splitter but is also preferably optimized for handling both the optical energy from the pumping source and the optical energy from the first optical source . The second beam splitter optically connects the second optical source and the Laser Light Generator to the optical energy passing through the optical path from the first Optical source and the Pumping Source .

In one embodiment the first beam splitter the second beam splitter or a combination thereof is a dichroic beam splitter whereby the beam splitter will efficiently separate the optical energy from the first optical source and the pumping source .

The Laser Light Generator produces a lasing energy in response to optical energy form the first optical source the pumping source or a combination thereof. The Laser Light Generator is preferably a Passively Q switched laser comprising a laser media adjacent to a Q switch positioned between a high reflectivity mirror and an optical coupler for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 421 166 hereby fully incorporated by reference. The laser media is preferably made of one of the plurality of materials as discussed in Koechner W. Bass M. Solid State Lasers A Graduate Text Springer New York 2003 hereby fully incorporated by reference. The laser media is preferably a doped host material preferably Glasses crystals such as Oxides Garnets Vanadates and Fluorides and ceramics. The Glasses are preferably doped with Nd Er or Yb. The Oxides such as sapphire is preferably doped with Ti. The Garnets are Yttrium Aluminum Garnet YAlO YAG Gadolinium Gallium Garnet GdGaO GGG and Gadolinium Scandium Aluminum Garnet GdScAlO GSGG and are preferably doped with rare earths such as Nd Tm Er Ho Yb. The Vanadates or Yttrium Orthovanadate YVO is preferably doped with Nd. The Fluorides or Yttrium Fluoride YLiF and is preferably doped with Nd. The laser media is preferably Nd YAG neodymium doped yttrium aluminium garnet Nd Glass neodymium doped glass Nd YLF neodymium doped yttrium lithium fluoride Nd YVO Yttrium Vanadate Er Glass Erbium doped glass Yb YAG ytterbium doped yttrium aluminium garnet Alexandrite Ti Sapphire Titanium sapphire . In the preferred embodiment the laser media is Nd YAG having about 0.5 atomic weight of Nd which will emit lasing power at about 1064 nm. The dopant level of the laser media is intentionally low to improve the performance of the laser. Lowering the dopant concentration affects the overall output by modifying the beam overlap the absorption depth of the optical pumping energy reducing thermal lensing losses and reducing losses due to ASE Amplified Spontaneous Emission . This leads to a much more uniform pumped gain profile as well as more uniformly distributed thermal stresses which lessen the effects of thermal lensing. The reduction of dopant concentration lowers the gain of the material slightly but offers larger energy storage capacity in return. The lasing power produced by the laser media has a peak power greater than the optical energy from the pumping source . Peak power is the maximum energy produced by a generation facility over a fixed period of time.

In one embodiment when the optical energy from the combined optical source excites the laser media in the Laser Light Generator thereby causing lasing a small portion of the lasing energy will pass through the high reflector at the back of the laser and will travel back through the optical path . This lasing energy will be at the wavelength of the laser in the Laser Light Generator different from the wavelength of optical energy from the combined optical source and can therefore be separated or distinguished by a filter the detector interlock control system or a combination thereof as described above. Preferably a filter as described above more preferably a dichroic filter is used to filter the lasing energy from reaching the detector . It is preferable to have at least a separate optical source more preferably additionally a separate first optical source as the embodiment described in will produce a dangerous pulse before it can be terminated as described herein. However this embodiment would be advantageous to monitor the optical path to the first protected output in a low cost efficient manner.

The depolarizer is any optical means of depolarizing light. The depolarizer is preferably a birefringent filter. A birefringent filter is a material which rotates polarized light in either an ordered or random fashion producing light which is not the same polarization as that which entered it. In an alternate embodiment the depolarizer is preferably a multimode optical fiber of sufficient length to depolarize the optical energy from the polarizing optical light source .
