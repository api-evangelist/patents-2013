According to another example embodiment the resource server may additionally or alternatively require user registration and or may require use of an authorized user device to access it. The resource server may store any type of data such as various types of general or individual specific content applications records and or any other data. For purposes of convenience the resource server is referred to herein in the singular although it will be understood that a plurality of servers may be employed in the arrangements as descried herein. Furthermore in some embodiments multiple compliance servers may operate on the same server computer. The components executed on the compliance server for example may comprise various applications services processes systems engines or functionality not disclosed in detail herein.

The compliance server may be any type of network accessible electronic device or system that includes storage such as the depicted compliance rule store and may be configured to communicate with the user device s and or the resource server over one or more networks such as the network depicted in to provide content and or device management capabilities. For example the compliance server may comprise cloud based solutions server computers and or any other system providing device management capability. For purposes of convenience the compliance server is referred to herein in the singular although it will be understood that a plurality of servers may be employed in the arrangements as descried herein. Furthermore in some embodiments multiple compliance servers may operate on the same server computer. The components executed on the compliance server for example may comprise various applications services processes systems engines or functionality not disclosed in detail herein. The compliance server may according to some example embodiments be configured to direct the resource server to transmit data or content e.g. to one or more user devices .

The compliance server may comprise a management application and a compliance rule store storing one or more compliance rules e.g. compliance policies that may be applicable to the user device s . While the management application is shown as within the compliance server the management application may additionally or alternately be within the user device s and or remotely located on the resource server and may be remotely updated such as periodically via compliance server according to any number of suitable over the air OTA updating methods.

Attempts by the user device s to perform certain functionality such as viewing modifying transmitting and or receiving content e.g. protected and or individual specific content may require the user device to be in compliance with one or more of the compliance rules. Depending on the sensitivity and or nature of a given functionality different compliance rules may be necessary to ensure that the functionality is adequately restricted. Some functionality may only require ensuring that the proper user is requesting the functionality. Other functionality may require compliance with more stringent authorization rules such as determining whether the functionality is restricted during certain time windows or geographic areas. Accordingly the user device s and or the compliance server may be operative to determine whether the user of the user device is authorized to perform requested functionality at the time the user requests to perform such functionality.

Compliance server may for example use the compliance rules to impose hardware restrictions regarding the use of specific devices and or specific device features such as for instance cameras Bluetooth IRDA tethering external storage a mobile access point and or other hardware restrictions.

For example the apparatus may be configured to respond to a generalized request by determining e.g. based on scheduling information one or more individuals scheduled for an appointment at a current time and to cause individual specific content associated with the determined one or more individuals to be transmitted. According to some example embodiments the request may comprise a specific request e.g. for particular individual specific content or for any individual specific content associated with a particular individual.

According to some example embodiments the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the compliance server resource server and or user device may further include means such as the processor the memory the communication interface and or the like for receiving information regarding at least one prerequisite condition relating to at least one individual. See operation . The information regarding the at least one prerequisite condition relating to the at least one individual may for example comprise information defining one or more prerequisite conditions that must be satisfied before allowing access to individual specific content. For example the information may define one or more prerequisite conditions that must be satisfied before individual specific content pertaining to the at least one individual is transmitted made viewable and or made modifiable. The information may additionally define one or more relationships between the one or more prerequisite conditions and the viewability and or modifiability of one or more portions of the protected individual specific content thereby allowing the viewability and or modifiability of each of one or more portions of protected individual specific content to be made independently contingent on one or more prerequisite conditions.

Examples of such prerequisite conditions relating to the at least one individual may for example include prerequisite conditions relating to the at least one individual s physical presence and or consent and or the existence of an appropriate circumstance for allowing access to the individual specific content. For example the at least one prerequisite condition may according to some embodiments comprise the individual being scheduled for an appointment at a particular time and or a location of the individual being within a predetermined proximity of a particular location or a particular electronic device e.g. user device that is to receive individual specific content associated with the individual. According to some example embodiments the one or more prerequisite conditions may comprise receipt of an indication of presence and or consent being received such as from a user device associated with the at least one individual. For example an individual may check in for an appointment e.g. via their user device and or an electronic device provided on site so as to cause transmission of the indication and thereby satisfy the prerequisite condition.

According to some example embodiments the at least one prerequisite condition may additionally or alternatively relate to one or more intake survey responses provided by the at least one individual. For example one or more intake survey responses provided by the at least one individual may be compared to one or more prior intake survey responses provided by the at least one individual and a degree of similarity may be determined. Accordingly the information regarding the at least one prerequisite condition may comprise a threshold degree of similarity between a present and one or more prior intake survey responses.

According to an example embodiment the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the compliance server resource server and or user device may further include means such as the processor the memory the communication interface and or the like for receiving information regarding the at least one individual. See operation . The information regarding the at least one individual may for example comprise any information related to the individual that may be used by the apparatus to determine whether the at least one prerequisite condition is satisfied. For example the information regarding the at least one individual may according to some embodiments comprise scheduling information e.g. information regarding if when the at least one individual is scheduled for an appointment. According to some example embodiments the information regarding the at least one individual may additionally or alternatively comprise information regarding at least one user device of the at least one individual such as an indication of a current position of the user device and or any of the device profile information discussed above. According to some other example embodiments the information regarding the at least one individual may additionally or alternatively comprise survey response information.

According to a further embodiment the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the compliance server resource server and or user device may include means such as those discussed above for determining whether the at least one prerequisite condition is satisfied. See operation . The apparatus may determine whether the at least one prerequisite condition is satisfied based at least in part on the information regarding the at least one prerequisite condition and the information regarding the at least one individual.

The apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the compliance server resource server and or user device may further include means such as the processor the memory the communication interface and or the like for causing individual specific content to be transmitted e.g. to at least one user device . See operation . For example according to some embodiments an apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the compliance server may direct the compliance server to transmit the individual specific content. According to some other example embodiments an apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with a user device e.g. a user device associated with the individual associated with the individual specific content may cause the individual specific content to be transmitted. At least a portion of the individual specific content may comprise protected content that is configured to prevent viewing and or modification. For example the protected content may be encrypted obfuscated or otherwise configured to be unviewable and or unmodifiable e.g. via the at least one user device .

The apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the compliance server resource server and or user device may further include means such as the processor the memory the communication interface and or the like for receiving at least one access credential. See operation . The at least one access credential may for example be associated with the at least one individual with which the individual specific content is associated. For example the at least one access credential may according to some embodiments comprise an identifier known to the individual such as a social security number password PIN or the like. According to some other example embodiments the at least one access credential may additionally or alternatively comprise a biometric signature such as a fingerprint iris pattern voice pattern or other verifiable physical feature of the at least one individual with which the individual specific content is associated. The at least one access credential may according to some example embodiments be transmitted to the apparatus by a user device such as the user device that received the individual specific content that is configured to receive the access credential such as via a user interface scanning device or the like.

According to other example embodiments the at least one access credential may additionally or alternatively comprise a code provided by a device or object associated with the at least one individual with which the individual specific content is associated such as an armband or pendant worn by the individual or a device implanted in the individual. Thus the at least one access credential may for example be received from a device e.g. a user device that is configured to scan a radio frequency ID RFID tag a quick response QR code or the like included in and or on a device or object associated with the at least one individual. According to some example embodiments the at least one access credential may comprise a code provided by an electronic device such as a user device security token wireless transmitter wearable electronic device such as a smart electronic armband smart card or the like associated with the at least one individual. According to some example embodiments the at least one access credential may comprise a code provided by an electronic device such as a general purpose computing device or a user device not directly associated with the individual. For example the code may be provided upon authentication of a user in receipt of the individual specific content.

According to some example embodiments the at least one access credential may be provided by an electronic device configured to provide the access credential in response to receiving a challenge response from a user such as from the at least one individual. The challenge response may comprise any of the identifiers discussed above such as a password PIN biometric signature or the like. According to some embodiments the electronic device may for example generate a temporary access credential in response to receiving the challenge response thereby providing only temporary access to the individual specific content e.g. limited to a certain period of time and or number of uses.

Each of the one or more access credentials may according to some example embodiments be associated with one or more portions of protected individual specific content. That is one or more relationships between the one or more access credentials and one or more portions of the protected individual specific content may be defined such as in a memory of the apparatus thereby allowing the viewability and or modifiability of each of one or more portions of protected individual specific content to be independently associated with one or more access credentials. Moreover access credentials may be associated with one or more roles policy groups or the like such that the viewability and or modifiability of various portions of protected content may be further dependent on one or more roles associated with a given access credential. For example a first user who provides an access credential associated with a first role policy group or the like may be able to view and modify a particular portion of protected individual specific content while a second user who provides a second access credential associated with a second role policy group or the like may only be able to view the particular portion. According to some example embodiments and regardless of the form or source of the at least one access credential the at least one access credential may comprise or may be used to determine one or more keys that may be used to decrypt one or more portions of protected content included in the individual specific content.

The apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the compliance server resource server and or user device may further include means such as the processor the memory the communication interface and or the like for authenticating the at least one access credential. See operation . The access credential may for example be authenticated by comparing it against a database of known access credentials.

The apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the compliance server resource server and or user device may further include means such as the processor the memory the communication interface and or the like for causing at least a portion of the protected content to be viewable and or modifiable e.g. via the at least one user device . See operation . For example the apparatus may be configured to decrypt at least a portion of the protected content. Causing at least a portion of the protected content to be viewable and or modifiable may for example be performed in response to authenticating the at least one access credential and or determining that the prerequisite condition has been satisfied.

According to some example embodiments causing at least a portion of the protected content to be viewable and or modifiable may comprise causing the protected content to be decrypted. For example the apparatus may cause at least a portion of the protected content to be decrypted by causing a key to be transmitted such as to the user device that received the individual specific content. The user device may then use the key to decrypt at least a portion of the protected content so as to allow the protected content to be viewed and or modified. According to other example embodiments the apparatus may cause at least a portion of the protected content to be viewable and or modifiable by causing an instruction to be transmitted such as to the user device . The user device may thus be configured to cause at least a portion of the protected content to be viewable and or modified such as via an application executable on the user device in response to receiving the instruction. For example the user device may be configured to decrypt at least a portion of the protected content such as by using a key stored in a memory of the user device or provided to the user device e.g. by a user or another electronic device.

As depicted in one or more of the above operations may be conditioned upon the prerequisite condition being satisfied and or the at least one access credential being successfully authenticated. See operations and . Moreover it will be understood that the operations depicted in may occur in many different orders according to various example embodiments. Thus according to some example embodiments the apparatus may cause transmission of the individual specific content only in an instance in which it has determined that the at least one prerequisite condition has been satisfied as depicted in . According to some other embodiments the apparatus may cause the individual specific content to be transmitted e.g. in response to receiving a request prior to determining whether the at least one prerequisite condition is satisfied but may cause at least a portion of the protected content of the individual specific content to be viewable and or modifiable only in an instance in which it has determined that the at least one prerequisite condition has been satisfied. According to other example embodiments the apparatus may cause the individual specific content to be transmitted in an instance in which it has received and according to some embodiments authenticated the at least one access credential and or determined that the prerequisite condition has been satisfied.

The apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the compliance server and or the resource server may further include means such as the processor the memory the communication interface and or the like for detecting an occurrence of at least one predetermined event. See operation . The apparatus may further include means such as those just listed for causing at least a portion of the protected content that the apparatus had previously caused to be viewable and or modifiable to again be unviewable and or unmodifiable. See operation . The apparatus may for example cause at least a portion of the protected content to again be unviewable and or unmodifiable by causing a signal to be transmitted to the user device the signal comprising an instruction code and or other information configured to direct and or enable the user device to cause at least a portion of the protected content to be unviewable and or unmodifiable such as by encrypting the portion of the protected content.

According to some example embodiments the at least one predetermined event may comprise an expiration of a predetermined amount of time. According to some other example embodiments the at least one predetermined condition may additionally or alternatively comprise the at least one individual with which the individual specific content is associated being located outside of a predetermined area or a predetermined proximity of a particular location e.g. a location of the user device that received the individual specific content. Thus the apparatus may determine whether the at least one predetermined event has occurred by receiving location information relating to the at least one individual such as by receiving location information regarding at least one electronic device associated with the at least one individual e.g. at least one user device associated with the at least one individual and comparing this location information with the predetermined area or with location information regarding the user device that received the individual specific content.

It will be understood that various portions of the protected individual specific content may be made viewable unviewable modifiable and or unmodifiable independently of one another. For example a first portion of the protected content may initially e.g. at the time it is transmitted be unviewable and unmodifiable while a second portion may initially be viewable but unmodifiable. Following satisfaction of the at least one prerequisite condition and receipt of the at least one access credential the first portion may then be made viewable but not modifiable and the second portion may be made modifiable. This may be achieved according to some example embodiments by separately encrypting the various portions of the protected individual specific content e.g. using distinct keys.

It will be further understood that any one portion of protected individual specific content may be made viewable unviewable modifiable and or unmodifiable in different instances and in response to different occurrences e.g. satisfaction of different prerequisite conditions receipt of different access credentials and or detection of different predetermined events. For example a first portion of protected individual specific content may initially be unviewable and unmodifiable. Following satisfaction of a first prerequisite condition and receipt of a first access credential the first portion of protected individual specific content may be made viewable but remain unmodifiable. Following satisfaction of a second prerequisite condition the first portion may be made modifiable. Following detection of a first predetermined event the first portion may again be made unmodifiable and following detection of a second predetermined event the first portion may again be made unviewable. Any number of other permutations of the above examples will be understood to be possible and will therefore not be explicitly listed.

A real world example involving a patient s electronic medical records is useful to understand the above concepts. The patient s electronic medical records may comprise unprotected content such as the patient s name date of birth and or address and protected content such as the patient s medical history. These electronic medical records may be transmitted to a user device associated with the patient s doctor and all of the protected content e.g. the entire medical history portion may initially be unviewable and unmodifiable. Following satisfaction of a first prerequisite condition such as the patient being scheduled for an appointment in the next hour and following receipt of a first access credential the medical history portion of the patient s medical records may be made viewable. The first access credential might for example comprise access credentials associated with the doctor such as a username and password. According to another example the doctor might log in to a website such as a website associated with the patient s insurance company and be provided with the first access credential such as a unique and or randomly generated code which the doctor may then enter into the doctor s user device .

Upon satisfaction of a second prerequisite condition such as the patient i.e. an electronic device associated with the patient being in a predetermined proximity of the doctor s user device the medical history portion of the patient s electronic medical records may be made modifiable. Following a first predetermined event such as after the patient is no longer within the predetermined proximity a first portion of the medical history portion of the patient s electronic medical records such as a portion relating to prior medical history may again be made unmodifiable while a second portion such as a portion for making notes on the just concluded appointment may remain modifiable. Following a second predetermined event such as expiration of a predetermined amount of time the second portion may again be made unmodifiable as well and the entire protected portion may be made unviewable. Thus some example embodiments may allow very precise control to be exercised over the visibility and or modifiability of various portions of protected individual specific content.

It will also be understood that according to some embodiments receiving the information regarding the at least one individual and receiving the access credentials may be accomplished in a single action. For example where a prerequisite condition involves the individual with which the individual specific content is associated being in proximity of a particular electronic device receiving an access credential by scanning or receiving a code such as by scanning a QR code or receiving a short range transmission from an object or electronic device on the individual s person may comprise both receiving information regarding the individual e.g. they are in close enough proximity to the particular electronic device to allow the scanning or reception and receiving the at least one access credential the code itself . Similarly receipt of a biometric signature may comprise both receiving the information regarding the individual e.g. that they are in close enough proximity to engage with the biometric scanner and the at least one access credential.

Similarly some embodiments may utilize this concept of dual purpose information to provide emergency access options such as in the case of electronic medical records. For example the existence of an emergency medical situation may be defined as a prerequisite condition for viewing and or modifying a protected portion of an individual s electronic medical records. For example some embodiments may provide the existence of an emergency medical situation involving the individual as a prerequisite condition for making all protected content viewable. Receiving a specific emergency access credential may thus comprise both receiving information regarding the individual that the individual is involved in an emergency medical situation and receiving the at least one access credential. Thus some embodiments may allow protected individual specific content to be received made viewable and or made modifiable by performing a single action which comprises both receiving at least one access credential and receiving information regarding the at least one individual sufficient to determine satisfaction of the prerequisite condition.
