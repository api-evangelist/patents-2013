The present invention relates to biological sampling and collection and more particularly to an external filter assembly adapted for modifying a suction cleaning device to sample relatively small particles from various hard to sample surfaces such as carpets cloth chairs tree leaves and grass and or the ambient air for subsequent biological testing and analysis.

Sampling devices have been used extensively to identify microbes and other bioagents for various applications including protection of military and civilian population against enemy attacks. Such sampling devices are typically designed to selectively sample either air or surfaces. Aerosol samplers include pre collectors and a number of concentration stages for isolating the particle sizes of interest. Thus these aerosol sampling devices are heavy and require high power for operation. Surface sampling devices contain components for managing liquids and are thus difficult to operate in a dynamic environment and not readily portable. In addition surface sampling devices are typically incapable of separating the sample particles by size resulting in samples containing undesirable larger size particles which undesirably interfere with analysis of any bioagents in the sample. These sampling devices are not readily portable not suited for large area sampling and require alternating current power sources.

Other sampling devices selected from Q tips sponges and swabs to sample surfaces visibly tainted with powder are available. However methods using such devices are only suitable for non porous surfaces and small area sampling thus they are tedious time consuming and labor intensive to implement.

Accordingly there is a need in the art to develop an external filter assembly designed to convert a suction cleaning device such as a portable hand holdable vacuum cleaner into a sampling device thus enabling large numbers of sampling devices to be rapidly constructed using commercially available components in short time and at relatively modest cost. There is a further need for an external filter assembly adapted for modifying a suction cleaning device to perform biological sampling in a manner to enhance portability and sampling area size and reduce cost while producing a testable quantity of aerosol and or surface based particles for subsequent testing and analysis.

The present invention relates generally to an external filter assembly adapted for modifying a suction cleaning device such as a vacuum cleaner to sample relatively small particles from various surfaces and or the ambient air for subsequent biological testing and analysis. The filter assembly of the present invention is designed with enhanced flexibility for accommodating different suction cleaning device configurations. In this manner the present invention can be used to rapidly construct a large number of sampling devices using commercially available components in a relatively short period of time and at a relatively modest cost. The filter assembly of the present invention produces a sampling device that is portable and has a large area of sampling coverage. The filter assembly of the present invention is relatively simple and cost effective to make and implement.

Generally the suction cleaning device is adapted to vacuum and capture particulates having sizes of 10 micrometers and greater. When properly installed on the suction cleaning device the filter assembly of the present invention is designed to capture any remaining particles missed by the suction cleaning device with a minimum collection efficiency of 50 for 0.3 to 0.4 micrometer and collection efficiency of 80 or better for 1.0 micrometer or larger after they exit the exhaust port of the suction cleaning device. Particles passing out of the suction cleaning device are generally of interest for biological testing and analysis. In this manner the present invention enables the separation of the relatively large size particulates e.g. hair fur dust and other debris from the smaller size particles such as spores bacterium viruses and the like thereby effectively isolating the small particles for testing and analysis.

Generally the suction cleaning device is adapted to vacuum and capture particulates 10 micrometers or larger. When properly installed on the suction cleaning device the filter assembly of the present invention is designed to capture any remaining particles missed by the suction cleaning device with a minimum collection efficiency of 50 for 0.3 to 0.4 micrometer or a minimum collection efficiency of 80 or better for 1.0 micrometer or larger after they exit the exhaust port of the suction cleaning device.

There is provided an external filter assembly adapted for modifying a conventional suction cleaning device to sample relatively small particles from various surfaces and or the ambient air including a housing having a first open end a second open end and a throughbore between the first and second open ends a filter adapted for capturing particles with particle sizes of greater than 0.1 micrometer the filter being mounted on and enclosing the first open end and means for sec rely retaining the second open end of the housing on an exhaust port of the suction cleaning device in communication with the housing throughbore.

Referring to an external filter assembly identified generally by reference numeral is useful for modifying a suction cleaning device to sample relatively small particles from various surfaces and or the ambient air in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The suction cleaning device generally includes a casing housing a motor driven air pump not shown in communication with an intake nozzle and an exhaust port and a non HEPA porous vacuum filter not shown typically in the form of a fiber or foam pouch housed in a debris holding canister within the casing . The air pump not shown creates a pressure drop at the intake nozzle thereby drawing ambient air and debris including particulates and particles outside the cleaning device into and through the intake nozzle in a constant air stream through the air pump not shown and out the exhaust port .

The non HERA porous vacuum filter not shown positioned in the path of air stream before the exhaust port captures relatively large particulates e.g. debris hair fur dirt soil sand and the like which are typically 10 micrometers or larger and allows the air stream to pass therethrough exiting the exhaust port . The suction cleaning device can be selected from a hand holdable portable vacuum cleaner preferably cordless such as for example 14.4V DUSTBUSTER Cordless Hand Vac vacuum cleaner Model No. CHV1410 available from Black Decker Corporation of Towson Md.

The filter assembly is adapted for mounting on the vacuum exhaust port of the cleaning device . Once mounted the cleaning device is modified into an air surface sampling device for sampling relatively small particles from the ambient air and or surfaces. The sampling device is especially suitable for collecting biological samples which can be processed for biological testing and analysis. The filter assembly includes a tubular housing a proximal end a distal end a gasket located at the proximal end a disc shaped sample filter collector affixed to the distal end and a retaining mechanism for securing the filter assembly to the cleaning device . The sample filter collector is adapted for capturing particles with particle sizes of greater than 0.1 micrometer and preferably greater than 6.61 micrometer.

The housing is constructed from any suitable rigid material such as for example glass metal wood and polymer based materials. The polymer based material can be selected from plastics such as polycarbonates and acrylics. In one embodiment of the present invention the housing is composed of an optically transmissive material encompassing transparent and translucent materials. The housing comprises a cylindrical shape having a diametric size suitable for accommodating the exhaust port of the cleaning device . It will be understood that the size shape and configuration of the housing is not limited to the embodiment shown and described herein and can encompass any size shape and configuration necessary for mounting to the exhaust portal of a suction cleaning device.

The proximal end of the filter assembly housing is adapted for mounting over and enclosing the exhaust port of the cleaning device to receive the air stream exiting therefrom and to direct it through the sample filter collector . The filter media of the sample filter collector see captures any remaining particles in the air stream exiting from the cleaning device . Thus the captured particles in the filter media are generally in the range of from about 0.1 micrometer to 10 micrometers.

Referring to particularly for filter assembly the housing includes an exhaust port opening at the proximal end a filter collector opening at the distal end and a throughbore extending therebetween. The filter collector opening a circular wall with a top surface or edge projecting from the distal end of the housing . The sample filter collector includes an opening surrounded by a frame with an outwardly extending tab for retaining a centrally located filter media and a skirt extending peripherally along the outer edge of the frame . The frame and the skirt are configured for frictional press fitting over the circular wall of the filter collector opening . The filter media is securely held in position by suitable means over the opening of the housing .

The tab provides a gripping surface portion for the user to remove and replace the sample filter collector during use. The filter media is configured to capture submicron size particles including biological pathogens pathogenic bacteria and spores. The filter media is selected from an air filter material such as for example fiberglass cellulose microfibrous materials and the like suitable for removing or capturing at least 85 of all particles greater than 0.1 micrometer and preferably at least 99.97 of all particles greater than 0.1 micrometer. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the filter media is an electret filter media such as the type manufactured and or sold by Research International Inc. of Monroe Wash.

The proximal end of the housing is mounted over the exhaust port in contact with the cleaning device casing via a gasket . The gasket ensures a seal tight engagement between the housing and the cleaning device casing . Gasket includes a circular base portion and a peripheral wall extending therealong. The peripheral wall of the gasket is configured for placement around the exhaust port opening of the housing for a snug fit retainment thereon as shown. When the housing of the filter assembly is mounted over the exhaust port of the cleaning device the gasket base portion maintains a tight sealing contact between the gasket and the cleaning device casing .

The retaining mechanism securely holds the proximal end of the housing to the exhaust port of the cleaning device in communication with the housing throughbore . The retaining mechanism includes a pair of casing studs threadedly engaged to corresponding openings on the cleaning device casing a pair of housing studs threadedly engaged to corresponding openings and a pair of elongated elastic band members resiliently engaged and securely attached between respective studs and to securely hold the filter assembly onto the cleaning device to thereby provide the resulting sampling device .

It is noted that the filter assembly of the present invention can be used to capture larger sample particles by removing the standard vacuum filter not shown from the suction cleaning device . In this configuration the sampling device can collect samples from hard to sample surfaces without utilizing size separation.

The present invention is also directed to a method for modifying a suction cleaning device to sample relatively small particles from various surfaces and or the ambient air which includes the steps of acquiring a filter assembly and mounting the proximal end of the filter assembly to an external exhaust port of the suction cleaning device in communication with the housing throughbore of the filter assembly .

Testing was conducted in an aerosol test chamber to determine the sampling efficiency of the sampling device of the present invention. spores were aerolized into the chamber using a sonic nozzle and the aerosol was mixed with fans to achieve a uniform aerosol concentration in the chamber. The sampling device used was a Black Decker DUSTBUSTER vacuum cleaner equipped with the filter assembly having a standard reference filter sampler . This is an electrets filter standard filter cartridge assembly part number 7100 134 232 01 Research International Inc. Monroe Wash. containing fibers with permanent static charge. These charges induce a charge in the aerosol passing through them and provide a capture mechanism for these aerosols. The sampling device sampled the air for about 3 minutes. The filters were removed from the sample filter collector for analysis.

The filters were placed into 20 mL of PBST with 0.01 Triton X and were shaken on a Table Shaker VWR VX2500 Multi tube Vortexer for about 10 minutes. Samples 100 microliters were plated on agar plates in triplicate and incubated overnight. The colonies were counted the next day and the sampling efficiency was determined based on airflow rate and colony count.

The results showed that the air flow through the filter was approximately 585 liters per minute with all the air directed through it and the sampling efficiency was about 23 . This is an acceptable number considering the larger particles which could adversely affect the analysis have been removed thereby allowing sampling of larger areas for each filter.

This device was also used in sampling bacteria in field testing. Samples were taken from grass concrete floor and other surfaces and the results showed significant amounts of bacteria collected by the sampling device.
