title: Systems and methods for image monitoring of check during mobile deposit
abstract: An image of a check that is in the field of view of a camera is monitored prior to the image of the check being captured. When the image of the check in the field of view passes monitoring criteria, an image may be taken by the camera and provided from the mobile device to a financial institution. The image capture may be performed automatically as soon as the image of the check is determined to pass the monitoring criteria. The check may be deposited in a user's bank account based on the image. Any technique for sending the image to the financial institution may be used. Feedback may be provided to the user of the camera regarding the image of the check in the field of view.

This application is a continuation of pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 545 127 filed on Aug. 21 2009 and titled Systems and Methods For Image Monitoring Of Check During Mobile Deposit which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Checks typically provide a safe and convenient method for an individual such as a payor to transfer funds to a payee. To use a check the individual usually opens a checking account or other similar account at a financial institution and deposits funds which are then available for later withdrawal. To transfer funds with a check the payor usually designates a payee and an amount payable on the check. In addition the payor often signs the check. Once the check has been signed it is usually deemed negotiable meaning the check may be validly transferred to the payee upon delivery. By signing and transferring the check to the payee the payor authorizes funds to be withdrawn from the payor s account on behalf of the payee.

While a check may provide a payor with a convenient and secure form of payment receiving a check may put certain burdens on the payee such as the time and effort required to deposit the check. For example depositing a check typically involves going to a local bank branch and physically presenting the check to a bank teller. To reduce such burdens for the payee systems and methods have been developed to enable the remote deposit of checks. For example the payee may capture a digital image of a check using a mobile device. The financial institution may then receive from the payee the digital image of the check. The financial institution may then use the digital image to credit funds to the payee. However such a technique requires the efficient and accurate detection and extraction of the information pertaining to a check in the digital image. Capturing a digital image at a mobile device that allows for subsequent detection and extraction of the information from the digital image is difficult.

An image of a check that is in the field of view of a camera is monitored prior to the image of the check being captured. The camera is associated with a mobile device. The monitoring may be performed by the camera the mobile device and or a financial institution that is in communication with the mobile device. When the image of the check in the field of view passes monitoring criteria an image may be taken by the camera and provided from the mobile device to a financial institution. The check may be deposited in a user s bank account based on the image. Any technique for sending the image to the financial institution may be used.

In an implementation the image capture may be performed automatically by the camera the mobile device and or the financial institution as soon as the image of the check is determined to pass the monitoring criteria. In an implementation feedback may be provided to the user of the camera regarding the image of the check in the field of view. The user may reposition the check and or the camera for example responsive to the feedback. Alternatively the user may capture an image of the check responsive to the feedback.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

In the following detailed description of example embodiments reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the example methods apparatuses and systems may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be used and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of this description.

A negotiable instrument typically includes a type of contract that obligates one party to pay a specified sum of money to another party. Negotiable instrument as used herein is an unconditioned writing that promises or orders payment of a fixed amount of money. One example of a negotiable instrument is a check. The check may be taken by the receiving party and deposited into an account at a financial institution of the receiving party. The receiving party may endorse the check and then present it for deposit at a bank branch via an automated teller machine ATM or by using remote deposit. Other examples of negotiable instruments include money orders cashier s checks drafts bills of exchange promissory notes and the like. A money order is a trusted financial instrument that is a payment order for a pre specified amount of money. A cashier s check also known as a bank check official check teller s check bank draft or treasurer s check is a check guaranteed by a bank and may be purchased from a bank.

The user may be an individual or entity who owns account that may be held at financial institution . Account may be any type of deposit account for depositing funds such as a savings account a checking account a brokerage account and the like. The user may deposit a check or other negotiable instrument in the account either electronically or physically. The financial institution may process and or clear the check or other negotiable instrument. The user may communicate with financial institution by way of communications network such as an intranet the Internet a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN a wireless fidelity WiFi network a public switched telephone network PSTN a cellular network a voice over Internet protocol VoIP network and the like. The user may communicate with financial institution by phone email instant messaging text messaging web chat facsimile mail and the like. Financial institutions and also may communicate with each other by way of communications network .

In an implementation the user may receive payment from another individual such as a payor in the form of a check or other negotiable instrument that is drawn from account at financial institution . The user may endorse the check e.g. sign the back of the check and indicate an account number on the check for depositing the funds. It is noted that although examples described herein may refer to a check the techniques and systems described herein are contemplated for and may be used for deposit of any negotiable instrument. Similarly the techniques and systems described herein are contemplated for and may be used with any form or document whose image may be captured with a camera or other imaging device of a mobile device for subsequent storage and or processing.

As described further herein a digital image of a check or other negotiable instrument may be provided from a user to a financial institution and the digital image may be processed and funds associated with the check or negotiable instrument in the digital image may be deposited in a user s bank account. The user may deposit the check into account by making a digital image of the check and sending the image file containing the digital image to financial institution . For example after endorsing the check the user may use a mobile device that comprises a camera to convert the check into a digital image by taking a picture of the front and or back of the check . The mobile device may be a mobile phone also known as a wireless phone or a cellular phone a personal digital assistant PDA or any handheld computing device for example. Aspects of an example mobile device are described with respect to .

To increase the likelihood of capturing a digital image of the check that may be readable and processed such that the check can be cleared the image is monitored for compliance with one or more monitoring criteria prior to the image of the check being captured. The monitoring criteria may be directed to proper lighting and or framing of the check in an image of the check that will be captured and presented for clearing of the check . An application may monitor whether the check is sufficiently within the frame of the camera and has a high enough quality for subsequent processing. The monitoring is performed with respect to the image as it appears in the field of view of the camera of the mobile device . The field of view is that part of the world that is visible through the camera at a particular position and orientation in space objects outside the field of view when the image is captured are not recorded in the image. The monitoring criteria may be based on one or more of light contrast on the image light brightness of the image positioning of the image dimensions tolerances character spacing skewing warping corner detection and MICR magnetic ink character recognition line detection as described further herein. In an implementation one or more histograms may be determined using the image being monitored. The histograms may be used in conjunction with monitoring criteria as described further herein.

The monitoring may be performed by the camera the mobile device and or a financial institution that is in communication with the mobile device . When the image of the check in the field of view passes the monitoring criteria an image may be taken by the camera and provided from the mobile device to a financial institution. By ensuring that the image of the check passes monitoring criteria during pre image capture monitoring the number of non conforming images of checks is reduced during presentment of the images to a financial institution for processing and clearing. In an implementation feedback may be provided to the user regarding the image of the check in the field of view. Based on the feedback the user may reposition the check and or the camera for example or may capture an image of the check .

In an implementation the image capture may be performed automatically by the camera the mobile device and or the financial institution as soon as the image of the check is determined to pass the monitoring criteria. Alternatively the user may manually instruct the camera to perform the image capture e.g. by pressing a button the camera or the mobile device after the user receives an indication or other feedback that the image passes the monitoring criteria.

In an implementation the user may send the digital image s to financial institution using the mobile device . Any technique for sending a digital image to financial institution may be used such as providing a digital image to a website associated with financial institution from storage emailing a digital image to financial institution or sending a digital image in a text message or instant message for example.

Financial institution may receive a digital image representing the check and may use any known image processing software or other application s to obtain the relevant data of the check from the digital image. Financial institution may determine whether the financial information associated therewith may be valid. For example financial institution may include any combination of systems and subsystems such as electronic devices including but not limited to computers servers databases or the like. The electronic devices may include any combination of hardware components such as processors databases storage drives registers cache random access memory RAM chips data buses or the like and or software components such as operating systems database management applications or the like. According to an embodiment the electronic devices may include a network based server that may process the financial information and may receive the digital image from the user .

The electronic devices may receive the digital image and may perform an analysis on the quality of the digital image the readability of the data contained therein or the like. For example the electronic devices may determine whether the account number amount payable and the like may be readable such that it may be parsed or otherwise obtained and processed by the financial institution to credit an account associated with the user and debit an account associated with the payor. In an implementation a representative of financial institution may provide assistance to the user and may provide assistance in determining whether the financial information may be readable and or of a good enough quality to be processed.

Upon receipt and approval of the digital image financial institution may credit the funds to account . Financial institution may clear the check by presenting a digital image of the check captured from the digital image to an intermediary bank such as a regional branch of the Federal Reserve a correspondent bank and or a clearinghouse bank. For example the check may be cleared by presenting the digital image to financial institution which may be a regional branch of the Federal Reserve along with a request for payment. Financial institutions and may have accounts at the regional branch of the Federal Reserve. Financial institution may create a substitute check using the image provided by the user and present the substitute check to financial institution for further processing. Upon receiving the substitute check financial institution may identify financial institution as the paying bank e.g. the bank from which the check is drawn . This may be accomplished using a nine digit routing number located on the bottom left hand corner of the check. A unique routing number is typically assigned to every financial institution in the United States. Financial institution may present the substitute check to financial institution and request that the check be paid. If financial institution verifies the check i.e. agrees to honor the check financial institution may then settle the check by debiting funds from financial institution and crediting funds to financial institution . Financial institution may then debit funds from account .

It will be appreciated that the preceding examples are for purposes of illustration and explanation only and that an embodiment is not limited to such examples. For example financial institution may be a correspondent bank i.e. engaged in a partnership with financial institution . Thus financial institution may bypass the regional branch of the Federal Reserve and clear the check directly with financial institution . In addition account and account may both be held at financial institution in which case the check may be cleared internally.

In an implementation the mobile device may comprise a video source such as a video camera a web camera or a video enabled phone for example to obtain a video of the check . A frame of the video may be obtained and monitored with respect to monitoring criteria as described further herein. The mobile device and or the institution may obtain the frame and monitor the frame depending on an implementation. Generation of a live video of a check is not limited to a video camera a web camera and a video enabled phone and it is contemplated that any device that is capable of generating a live video may be used to make a video of the check which may be monitored in real time with respect to monitoring criteria. Additional devices that may be used in the generation and or transmission of a live video include a web enabled video computing device a mobile phone a camcorder and a computer camera for example.

In an implementation the mobile device may comprise a camera such as a digital camera. Such a mobile device may be called a camera phone. The mobile device through the camera has the ability to take or capture a picture or digital image of the check or other negotiable instrument. The camera may take an image of the front of the check . Alternatively the camera may take an image of both the front and the back of the check . The back of the check may provide endorsement verification such as the signature of the person or party the check is made out to.

In an implementation prior to an image in the field of view of the camera being captured by the camera the image may be monitored with respect to monitoring criteria e.g. using a software application running on the mobile device . Feedback based on the monitoring of the image may be provided to the user to assist the user in positioning the check so that the image of the check may be captured in such a manner that it may be more easily processed and cleared during subsequent operations such as those involving one or more financial institutions.

A depository may include a bank in which the user has a deposit account however the present disclosure is not limited to just banks. Alternatively a third party may act as the depository providing functionality to a plurality of users without regard to the bank at which they have deposit accounts or whether their individual bank allows for the methods and systems described herein. The depository in an implementation after receiving the image s of the check from the user may use a clearinghouse to perform the check clearing operations. As described with respect to the system of check clearing operations are used by banks to do the final settlement of the check such as removing funds from the account of the payor and transferring those funds to the user s bank. The user s bank may choose to make the funds available to the user immediately and take on the risk that the check does not clear. However for various reasons the bank may only make those funds available to the user after the check finally clears.

In an implementation the user may place the check on a background and generate a digital image comprising an image of the check e.g. a check image and a portion of the background e.g. a background image using the camera . Any background may be used although a dark background or a consistently colored background may provide more optimal results. It is noted that although examples and implementations described herein may refer to a check image and check data the term check image may refer to any foreground image in a digital image as opposed to the background image and the term check data may refer to any foreground data in a digital image as opposed to background data . Thus the check image and the check data may refer to the foreground image and foreground data in implementations involving any negotiable instrument form or document.

In an implementation the image being monitored in the field of view of the camera comprises check data and background data. The check data pertains to the check image and the background data pertains to the background image e.g. the background on which the check image is disposed .

Feedback regarding the image in the field of view with respect to the monitoring criteria may be generated and provided to the user . In an implementation the feedback may be provided visually such as by text e.g. go closer go farther move the check to the right put the check on a darker background tilt the camera down take the picture now etc. arrows or other visual indicators or cues e.g. green lights red lights etc. overlaid on the image shown as feedback indicator . Alternatively or additionally feedback may be provided to the user aurally such as through a speaker associated with the mobile device . The feedback may advise the user to move the camera or the check or adjust the lighting or the background for example. The feedback may also advise the user when the image passes the one or more monitoring criteria and to capture the image of the check .

One of the monitoring criteria may be based on the positioning of the check in the image . The positioning of the check may be determined from the image and compared with predetermined dimensions e.g. of a typical personal check of a typical business check and tolerances. If the dimensions are within a certain acceptable tolerance then it may be determined that the check is properly positioned. Such feedback may be generated and provided to the user .

In an implementation the positioning of the check in the image may be compared with an alignment guide which may or may not be visible to the user in the field of view of the camera . For example measurements may be made by a processor in the camera the mobile device or a computing device at the financial institution to determine the check s position with respect to the alignment guide. The measurements may be compared to predetermined measurements or values to determine whether the check s positioning in the image is proper or sufficient for further processing of the image. Edge detection and or corner detection may be used in such measurements e.g. in measuring the distance from the check in the image to the alignment guide . Any known technique s for edge detection and or corner detection may be used. In an implementation corner detection itself may be a monitoring criterion such that if corner detection of the check in the image is achieved then it may be concluded that the image may be properly processed and cleared by a depository i.e. the image passes the monitoring criteria .

The alignment guide may be overlaid on the camera feed of the mobile device in an implementation. The alignment guide may take any shape such as a bounding rectangle or other bounding box or shape horizontal and or vertical bars parallel lines etc. for example. With a bounding rectangle for example used as the alignment guide aligning the check thereby passing this monitoring criterion means enclosing the check within the bounding rectangle. If the check is outside of the alignment guide in the image feedback may be generated and provided to the user regarding this monitoring criterion with instructions for moving the check or the camera in order to properly align the check in the field of view.

The operator of the camera may introduce distortions in the image due to a perspective problem specifically an angling of the camera vertically over the check and the top of the check is smaller than the bottom or the reverse. Monitoring criteria may also be directed to determining whether the image is skewed or warped. Skewing occurs when the check is rotated from the horizontal in the image . By measuring the distance from the edge s of the check in the image to an alignment guide or the edge of the field of view it may be determined whether the check is skewed e.g. by comparing the distances to one another by comparing the distances to predetermined values etc. . If skewing is present in the image feedback may be generated and provided to the user with instructions for moving the check or the camera in order to properly align the check in the field of view with respect to the horizontal.

Warping as used herein is meant to denote that the check is tilted forward or back with respect to a plane that is perpendicular to a line drawn from the camera lens to the center of the check . Warping or tilting of the image may lead to incorrect optical detection of the check . In an implementation a processor in the camera the mobile device or a computing device at the financial institution may determine whether warping is present in the image and if so may generate and provide feedback to the user . Such feedback may comprise instructions to the user for moving the check or the camera such that the check would appear to be perpendicular to an imaginary line drawn from the center of the camera lens to the center of the check itself e.g. dewarping instructions .

If user involvement is tolerated the user may be queried to supply or identify one or more corners of the check in the image . The perimeter of the check may be determined using this information. Additionally this information may be used for monitoring the image for distortions.

In an implementation a monitoring criterion may be whether the MICR line can be detected and or read. Any known MICR line detection technique s may be used by the camera the mobile device and or the financial institution e.g. using an image processor for example to detect the MICR line on the check in the image . If the MICR line can be detected it may be determined that the image may be captured and sent to the financial institution for processing and clearing of the check i.e. the image passes the monitoring criterion directed to MICR line detection . If the MICR line cannot be detected feedback may be provided to the user such as to reposition the check and or the camera i.e. the image fails to pass the monitoring criterion perhaps because the image is out focus or the lighting is inadequate for example .

In an implementation spacing between certain characters points or features e.g. MICR number sign signature line courtesy amount line legal amount line etc. may be determined and used as a monitoring criterion. For example if the MICR line can be detected then the spacing between the numbers in the MICR line may be determined using any known measuring and or image processing technique s . If the spacing is outside of a certain range corresponding to valid spacing between number in a MICR line then it may be determined that the image may be not properly processed if captured by the camera . In such a case feedback may be generated and provided to the user such as to reposition the check and or the camera .

Another monitoring criterion may be based on the light in the image such as the light contrast and or light brightness found on the image such as in various regions of the image . For example if the light contrast between the check image and the background image is less than a predetermined amount then it may be determined that the image may be not properly processed if captured by the camera . In such a case instead of capturing the image feedback may be generated and provided to the user to adjust the camera the check and or the lighting in order to bring the image into compliance with the monitoring criteria.

As another example the light brightness on various regions of the image may be determined and compared to each other and or may be compared to a predetermined threshold. If the difference between the light brightness of the various regions is less than a predetermined amount e.g. the light brightness does not vary significantly among the regions or if the light brightness is less than a predetermined threshold then it may be determined that the image may be properly processed if captured by the camera . Otherwise feedback may be generated and provided to the user to adjust the camera the check and or the lighting in order to change the light brightness on the image .

In an implementation one or more histograms may be generated based on the image and used in the determination of light contrast and or light brightness monitoring criteria. A histogram is a well known graph and may be used to display where all of the brightness levels contained in an image are found from the darkest to the brightest. These values may be provided across the bottom of the graph from left darkest to right brightest . The vertical axis the height of points on the graph shows how much of the image is found at any particular brightness level.

Histograms may be used to monitor whether the light on the image is uniform not too bright etc. For example the mobile device can monitor the histogram of the image to ensure that there is a large contrast between the background image and the check image . Feedback may be provided to the user as to how to move or adjust the camera lighting etc. in order to get a good image for subsequent processing i.e. how to get an image that passes the monitoring criteria .

In an implementation the image may be divided into segments such as those shown in . is a diagram of the example image of divided into segments that may be used for monitoring the image . Although four segments are shown in any number of segments may be used with techniques described herein. Although the segments are formed by dividing the image into quadrants the segments may be formed by any techniques take any shape and have any area subject to a constraint that each segment comprises a portion of the check data and a portion of the background data separated by a portion of the edge . In this manner distinct areas of density corresponding to the background of the image and the check data of the image may be provided in a histogram.

The density distribution for each segment or for the entire image may be analyzed to determine whether the light contrast and or light brightness is appropriate for processing and clearing of the check in the image and thus passes that monitoring criterion or whether the light contrast and or light brightness does not pass the monitoring criterion and the camera the check and or the light source should be adjusted or repositioned. For example the density distributions for the segments may be compared with each other and or may be compared to predetermined values or levels. If the differences are less than a predetermined difference amount such as less than 1 percent different less than 5 percent different etc. then the image may be captured and sent to the financial institution for processing. Otherwise feedback may be generated and provided to the user to reposition the camera the check and or the light source.

When the image passes the monitoring criteria e.g. is positioned properly with respect to an alignment guide is not warped is not skewed has adequate light brightness and or light contrast etc. the image may be captured either automatically e.g. by the camera or the mobile device under direction of an application running on the camera or the mobile device or the financial institution or manually e.g. by the user pressing a button or making a selection on the camera or the mobile device . The digital image thus captured may be provided from the mobile device to a financial institution. The check may be deposited in a user s bank account based on the digital image. Any technique for sending the digital image to the financial institution may be used.

The server in one example may send instructions to the client that execute an application on the client . This may include instructions that cause a software object which may have been previously downloaded and installed e.g. pre installed on the client to be executed on the client . The software object may analyze the image in the field of view of a digital camera e.g. the image shown in the field of view of the camera associated with the mobile device with respect to one or more monitoring criteria and may generate and provide feedback to the user regarding the monitoring criteria and or instructions for capturing an image of the check .

In another example the instructions may include a wholly self contained application that when delivered to the client will execute and perform one or more operations described herein such as those directed to analyzing the image in the field of view of the camera with respect to monitoring criteria and providing feedback to the user . In either example the software object may be configured to make one or more software calls to the camera . This may be through specific software instructions to the camera . In other words the camera s functionality may not be abstracted through any software library. In such an example software code may be written and delivered to every different camera equipped mobile phone.

In an alternate example the software object may operate through a software abstraction layer such as an application programming interface API . The software object developer may only insert code into the software object to call one or more APIs exposed by the software operating the mobile device . One example of such software is Windows Mobile by Microsoft Corporation. In the context of a Windows Mobile device the Windows Mobile operating system OS has one or more APIs exposed to application developers that will translate instructions from applications into instructions operable by the camera on the mobile device . A mobile operating system also known as a mobile platform or a handheld operating system is the operating system that controls a mobile device. Other mobiles OSs include Symbian OS iPhone OS Palm OS BlackBerry OS and Android.

The software object may cause the camera to analyze an image in the field of view with respect to monitoring criteria provide feedback and or take a picture or capture one or more images of the check being deposited. These images may be captured sequentially e.g. pursuant to the user flipping the check over after an image of the front of the check has been captured after passing the monitoring criteria. However each side of the check may be captured by the camera using similar API calls. The images may be stored in an image file .

Once the images of one or both sides of the check pass the monitoring criteria and are captured by the camera the image file may be operated on by the software object of the client . These operations may include any of the following deskewing dewarping magnetic ink character recognition cropping either automatically or having the user manually identify the corners and or edges of the check for example reducing the resolution of the image number detection character recognition and the like.

With respect to number and character recognition commercial check scanners have used characteristics of the MICR encoding to detect information about the check such as the bank s routing number and the account number. However the characteristics that these scanners have used are the magnetic characteristic of the ink itself and these scanners have used methods similar to those of magnetic audio tape readers. In an implementation a software object of the client may optically recognize the characters on the MICR line as a consumer mobile device such as the mobile device will lack the magnetic reading ability of a commercial check scanner.

The image may be also down converted into a grayscale or black and white image such as either in Joint Photographic Experts Group JPEG compliant format or in tabbed image file format TIFF for example. In an alternate example the image may be formatted as a Scalable Vector Graphics SVG image. One of the benefits of an SVG file is a large size advantage over JPEG. In the former example the image at some point before entry into the clearing system may be converted to TIFF format. This may be performed at the mobile device wherein the camera captures the image in TIFF format. However the camera of the mobile device may capture the image in JPEG format which may then be converted into TIFF either at the mobile device or at the server . In the latter example this may use the transmission of the TIFF image across a communications network which may be more advantageous as TIFF images are typically smaller in file size for the same size of picture as a JPEG formatted image.

The software object on the client may operate by performing one or more of the operations described herein and then transmitting an image file e.g. based on image file that has been processed to the server after the user confirms that they do wish to deposit the check . Alternately the software object may capture the image of the check and transmit that image to the server that in turn may perform those operations verifies that the image quality is within acceptable thresholds and communicates that verification back to the client which can then instruct the user to take a picture of the other side of the check . In this example the image transmitted to the server may be in any format such as JPEG or TIFF insofar as the server software has the ability to convert that image into a Check 21 compliant format. Alternately the bank may output an X9.37 file to the clearing system. The Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act or Check 21 Act is a United States federal law that allows the recipient of a paper check to create a digital version thereby eliminating the need for further handling of the physical document. The Check 21 standard for electronic exchange is defined in the standard DSTU X9.37 2003 X9.37 . It is a binary interchange format.

The server may confirm e.g. using a process confirmation with the user the transmission reception and processing of each side of the check separately or may confirm both sides at the same time. On the server side more operations may be performed such as signature verification. Where to perform these operations may be determined by the processing power of the mobile device itself which is typically limited in computational power. However the present discussion is not limited in any way by discussion of where certain operations are described as operating. The operations of detecting and verifying information may be performed by the client before the information is transmitted along with the image in the image file to the server . Alternately the software object s operating on the mobile device may perform no operation other then capturing images of the front and back of the check after passing the monitoring criteria receiving confirmation that the user wishes to proceed and transmitting those images to the server wherein the server performs those operations.

In an implementation after the image file has been received by the server the server may send a process confirmation to the client . The process confirmation may request instructions from the client to continue proceeding with the deposit now that the server has received the image file . In response the client may send a deposit confirmation to the server instructing the server to process the deposit of the check based on the image file that had been received by the server .

In an implementation the check images may be received following a software call from the check processing module to the image monitoring and capture module . In such an implementation the image monitoring and capture module may include the camera contained within the mobile device . Alternately the camera may be detachably coupled to the mobile device such as through a secure digital SD slot or over any suitable communications bus such as USB universal serial bus .

In an implementation the image monitoring and capture module may obtain an image and send the image to a financial institution e.g. financial institution the server the server apparatus etc. for processing. In an implementation the client apparatus may comprise a browser such as a web browser for accessing a website on the Internet or other network associated with a financial institution. The user may access the website and select a monitor and capture image link or similar icon button or link for example displayed on the browser. Such a selection may call the image monitoring and capture module on the client apparatus .

The communications module may be configured in one example to receive and send data signals over a suitable communications network. This may include without limitation GSM GPR3 HSDPA CDMA TDMA 802.11 802.16 and the like. While the bandwidth available to the mobile device may be an implementation concern such discussion is outside the scope of the present discussion and any suitable wireless communications network is considered to be within the scope of the present discussion. With respect to the present discussion the communications module may receive one or more processed check images from the check processing module and may transmit them over the suitable communications network to the depository as described herein.

The check processing module may be configured in one example to cause the image monitoring and capture module to monitor an image of at least one side of a check provided in a field of view of the camera and then capture the image after it passes monitoring criteria. Compliance with the monitoring criteria is intended to ensure that the image of the check is suitable for one or more processing tasks. For instance if the check is rotated 45 degrees clockwise when captured the check processing module or a software object operated on the server described above may be unable to optically detect information on the check.

The check processing module may perform one or more cleaning or processing operations on the captured image of the check. Such cleaning or processing may include dewarping and or deskewing if not part of the monitoring criteria in an implementation for example. Cleaning or processing may include down converting the image received from the image capture module to a suitable size such as 200 dots per inch DPI resolution or in a resolution range such as 200 DPI to 400 DPI 300 DPI to 500 DPI etc. and or converting the image to grayscale or black and white. Such operation s may reduce the file size of the check image. Alternatively the check processing module may send instructions to the image monitoring and capture module to cause the image monitoring and capture module to capture an image of the check at a suitable resolution. The check processing module may additionally perform any of the following operations in further examples convert from JPEG to TIFF detect check information perform signature detection on the image of the check and the like. The check processing module may alternatively send the captured check image to the server described herein for such processing and receive confirmation that the operations were completed before further operations can proceed.

The size of the file sent between the mobile device and the server may be small. This runs counter with respect to automatic check detection against a background. If captured in color the contrast between check and background becomes easier. However the processed image sent over the communications network may need to be smaller and if the detection operation is performed by the server it may be advantageous to convert the captured image to grayscale or even black and white before transmission to the server. Grayscale images are compliant with the Check 21 Act.

While flat is a fairly well known term to users each user s appreciation of flat with respect to the camera lens of the camera associated with the mobile device may result in a problem with needing to align the check image programmatically or risk rejecting a large number of check images. As the image captured is a set of pixels a tilted image will result in a jagged polygon rather than a perfect rectangle. Using convex hull algorithms the check processing modules may create a smooth polygon around the boundary and remove the concavity of the check image. Alternatively a rotating calipers algorithm may be used to determine the tightest fitting rectangle around the check boundary which can then be used to determine the angle of it with that angle being used to align the check properly.

The server apparatus may include one or more software objects operating on a server operated by the depository . Aspects of an example server apparatus are described with respect to . The server apparatus may include a communications module a check processing module and a check clearance module . The server apparatus may receive one or more processed images from a mobile device or a client apparatus as an input and may output a file such as a Check 21 compliant file . The Check 21 compliant file may be a file or entry in a record set that is compliant with the clearinghouse rules set forth in the Check 21 Act and may include outputting an X9.37 file in one example.

The communications module may be configured to receive a wireless communication from the mobile device over any suitable communications network such as those described above. The communications module may additionally receive a communication over a different communications network than the mobile device communicated on such as receiving the communication over a TCP IP Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol connection from the user s communication provider.

The check processing module may be configured in one example to perform one or more check processing operations on the processed image s that are received. In an implementation these operations may include any of the operations described herein with respect to the check processing module . The operation of signature verification may be performed by the check processing module of the server apparatus as the server apparatus may interface with other systems of the depository that may maintain previously verified signature samples of the user . Performing signature verification at the client apparatus may be computationally unfeasible additionally there may be a security risk if the signature sample is stored on the user s own device.

A cropped grayscale image may be sent to the server apparatus . The server apparatus may extract information via a TIFF conversion and determine the DPI and re scale to the proper DPI e.g. convert to TIFF and detect the DPI that was used in the grayscale image . In an implementation DPI detection may run on the client apparatus .

The check clearance module may be configured in one example to receive a file from the check processing module and may communicate with a check clearinghouse such that a Check 21 compliant file may be delivered to the check clearinghouse and funds may be received by the depository . The availability of the funds to the user may be delayed by this operation such that the user only has access to those funds when the depository receives confirmation that the check has cleared.

At the system may initialize a software object on the mobile device. This may include sending instructions to the mobile device intended to execute a previously installed i.e. pre installed software object. Alternatively the system may send a software object to the mobile device that may execute the software object carry out operations described herein by use of the software object and terminate the software object. In an implementation the system may instruct a camera associated with the mobile device to monitor and capture an image of the negotiable instrument in conjunction with monitoring criteria.

The user may use the camera to obtain an image in the field of view of the camera and at the image in the field of view of the camera may be monitored with respect to one or more monitoring criteria such as those described above. The monitoring may be performed by the camera the mobile device and or a computing device associated with the depository for example. The monitoring may be performed pursuant to instructions received at the camera or mobile device from the deposit system operated by a depository the server or the server apparatus for example. In an implementation the results of the monitoring may indicate that the camera and or the check should be repositioned and or the light source should be adjusted prior to an image capture in order to capture an image of the check that may be processed properly e.g. to have the data from the check obtained without error from the image so that that check can be cleared.

At feedback based on the results may be generated and provided visually and or aurally to the user via the camera and or the mobile device. In an implementation the feedback may be provided if the image fails to pass the monitoring criteria. The feedback may comprise instructions or guidance for the user to follow to obtain an image of the check in the field of view of the camera that will pass the monitoring criteria. Processing may continue at with the image that is currently in the field of view of the camera after the user has received and acted on the feedback being monitored with respect to the monitoring criteria.

When the image in the field of view passes the monitoring criteria as determined at the image in the field of view may be captured by the camera at . This may be accomplished through the software object accessing a camera associated with the mobile device e.g. either comprised within the mobile device or separate from the mobile device . This may be done through an API exposed by the OS of the mobile device or may be through software code customized for a specific phone and specific camera. With respect to the former a developer of the software object may write code to the camera API s which may be specific to the OS and without regard to the camera on the device. The user may initiate the capture of the image e.g. by pressing a button on the camera or the mobile device or the image may be captured automatically without user intervention as soon as the image in the field of view is determined to have passed the monitoring criteria. In this manner the occurrence of non conforming images downstream e.g. at a depository or financial institution is reduced and there is a high confidence that the image will be properly processed downstream.

In an implementation when the image in the field of view is determined to pass the monitoring criteria feedback may be generated and provided to the user indicating so. The feedback may instruct the user to capture the image now e.g. by pressing a button on the camera or mobile device or may advise the user that the image has been captured for example.

At the captured image may be transmitted to the depository e.g. as a digital image file. At the depository may receive the image of the check along with financial information pertaining to the account for depositing funds for example and may process the image. Processing of the digital image file may include retrieving financial information regarding the check. The financial information may comprise the MICR number the routing number an amount etc. Any known image processing technology may be used such as edge detection filtering to remove imagery except the check image or check data in the received digital image file image sharpening and technologies to distinguish between the front and the back sides of the check. The depository may identify and or remove at least a portion of data that is extraneous to the check such as background data.

After retrieving the financial information from the check in an electronic data representation form the depository may determine whether the financial information such as the amount payable to the user the account associated with the user to deposit funds an account associated with a payor to debit funds and an institution associated with the payor etc. may be valid. For example the depository may include electronic devices such as computers servers databases or the like that may be in communication with each other. The electronic devices may receive an electronic data representation and may perform an analysis on the quality of the data representation the readability of the data representation or the like. For example the electronic devices may determine whether the account number amount payable or the like may be readable such that they may be parsed and processed by the depository to credit an account associated with the user.

If the financial information is determined to be valid the electronic data representation may be processed by the depository thereby depositing the money in the user s account. If the financial information is determined to be invalid then the user may be advised. For example the depository may transmit an email a web message an instant message or the like to the user indicating that the financial information associated with the electronic data representation may be invalid. The user may determine how to proceed by selecting an option on the web message replying to the email or the like.

Thus in an implementation instructions on how the user would like to proceed may be requested from the user such as whether the user would like to try the deposit again e.g. make another image of the check that pass the monitoring criteria and send it to the depository or whether the user would like assistance from a representative for example. The user may indicate how they would like to proceed. If the user would like assistance the financial information may be transferred to a representative for further review. The representative may review the financial information associated with the electronic data representation to determine whether to allow the electronic data representation to be processed by the depository. If so the electronic data representation of the financial information may be processed by the depository thereby depositing the check in the user s account. The depository may send a notice to the user via email facsimile instant message or mail for example that the check has been deposited into the selected account.

At the user may send a request to deposit the check and may select an account in which to deposit the check. In an implementation the user may select a deposit check option provided on the website and may enter details such as check amount date the account the check funds should be deposited in comments etc.

At an image in the field of view of the camera may be obtained and provided via the communication pathway to the institution. A still image may be provided or a video may be provided such as a video stream generated by the camera.

At the institution may receive the image or video stream and may analyze the image or a frame of the video stream with respect to one or more monitoring criteria such as those described above. Feedback pertaining to the image with respect to the monitoring criteria may be generated and provided to the user over the communication pathway. Based on the feedback the user may adjust the position the camera and or the check and or may adjust the light source until the image in the field of view of the camera is determined by the institution to pass the monitoring criteria.

When the image in the field of view passes the monitoring criteria the image in the field of view may be captured e.g. automatically without user intervention or pursuant to the user pressing a button by the camera at thereby creating a digital image of the check. In an implementation the user may instruct the camera e.g. by pressing a button on the camera or the mobile device to create the digital image. In another implementation the camera may automatically create the digital image as soon as the image of the check passes the monitoring criteria. In this manner the user may point the camera at the check such that the image of the check appears in the field of view and after image has been determined to pass the monitoring criteria a digital image of the check may be created without further user intervention. Depending on the implementation one or more digital images of the check e.g. corresponding to the front and back of the check may be created using such techniques.

At the digital image s may be uploaded to the institution using any known image upload process. In an implementation the upload may be augmented by secondary data which may be information relating to the deposit of the check such as an account number and a deposit amount for example. At when the institution has received the digital images e.g. of the front and back sides of the check the institution may process the digital images to obtain an image of the check and to deposit the funds of the check in the user s account as described herein. It is contemplated that processing such as grayscale conversion image cropping image compression edge and or corner detection etc. may be implemented in the method . Such operations may be performed on one or more digital images created by the camera and may be performed on the image s by the mobile device and or by the institution as described further above.

Although the examples described herein may refer to uploading of images of checks to an institution it is contemplated that any negotiable instrument or image e.g. vehicle accident pictures provided to an insurance company may be processed and or transmitted using the techniques described herein. Additionally one or more of the techniques described herein may be performed by the institution instead of the mobile device of the user.
