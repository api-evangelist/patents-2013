The present invention is a U.S. National Stage filing under 35 U.S.C. 371 c of International Application No. PCT US13 25116 filed Feb. 7 2013 which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Appln. No. 61 600 143 filed on Feb. 17 2012 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

The present invention relates generally to emergency response systems for providing emergency assistance in response to distress information.

Emergency response systems are generally designed to provide a person e.g. a victim of a crime with emergency response preferably quickly enough to ensure that security personnel are on the scene early enough to stop or otherwise thwart the criminal act.

Millions of security surveillance cameras sometimes referred to as CCTV closed circuit television cameras are installed worldwide. Some surveillance cameras are publicly viewable internet connected cameras. For simplicity security surveillance cameras are referred to as a whole as CCTV cameras . CCTV cameras are installed to monitor activity persons or property and often are used to record or deter criminal or suspicious activities. CCTV cameras are used in both public and private areas. It is well known that many public areas are under surveillance both domestically in the USA and in other countries such as Britain where some estimate there is at least one CCTV camera for every 32 citizens.

CCTV cameras are often mounted to buildings poles ceilings or walls and are positioned to allow the camera to have a view of an area to monitor for suspicious or criminal activities. The view range for some CCTV cameras may be altered remotely by exercising the CCTV cameras pan tilt or zoom capabilities. Other CCTV cameras are fixed mounted without the capabilities to alter the camera view range or angles.

CCTV cameras may be wireless and communicate by a means such as WIFI or may be hard wired by means such as coax or Ethernet cables which provide connectivity between the camera and a security monitoring control room SMCR or station. One example of such a control room is a police dispatch center with equipment such as TVs or monitor screens that may display images or video from the CCTV cameras. A SMCR may have one viewable screen per CCTV camera to view images or video that is transferred from the camera to display controller or recording equipment in the SMCR. There are however typically far fewer display monitors than cameras.

Some SMCRs have large screen monitors that allow viewing 4 8 or more CCTV imagery on a single screen. Display screens may be controlled and programmed to rotate their views to different CCTV cameras in the field which results in only a subset of all CCTV cameras available being displayed at any given time. The CCTV camera displays may be controlled by program code or manually to show areas of prime interest or to simulate a virtual patrol walk around the campus or area being monitored.

Often a security officer in a SMCR must manually choose which camera s to view on screen. Some methods used to select CCTV camera s to view include typing a camera number into a keypad e.g. show CCTV camera pushing a button on a camera controller selector device using voice recognition software or by moving a cursor on a computer display and selecting the camera s to show. The software used to control and manage CCTVs is often referred to as a Video Management System VMS . A VMS such as those offered by On Net Surveillance Systems Inc. of Pearl River N.Y. OnSSI Exacq Technologies Inc. of Fishers Ind. Milestone AV Technologies LLC of Savage Minn. or Genetec Inc. of Saint Laurent Canada may be utilized to control and manage which camera s video feed s are displayed.

A VMS can display video feeds from one or more cameras when a person operating the VMS user interface instructs the VMS to do so or by other software to control the VMS by sending text strings or other commands to the VMS Application Programming Interface API . Some CCTV camera controllers have motion sensors associated with them to cause their imagery to be highlighted or selected when motion occurs. Other systems use artificial intelligence computational methods that may employ pattern recognition to determine CCTV cameras of interest .

In many cases CCTV camera video and images are recorded to tape disk or other storage mediums for later retrieval if needed to perform a post event analysis or investigation of a security event or crime. Many institutions or organizations have hundreds or thousands of CCTV cameras installed in areas they wish to monitor or protect. The larger the number of CCTV cameras installed by any given organization the more prohibitively expensive it is to employ a staff of CCTV camera watcher people to actively study every CCTV camera screen at all times. In addition to being very expensive there is a human fatigue factor that may lead to the conclusion that it is impractical to employ humans to watch all possible CCTV cameras at all times. Given the expensive cost to have an employee watch each camera screen many organizations choose to instead use recorded CCTV camera footage as a post mortem tool for investigations after an incident has occurred.

CCTV cameras are just one type of security tool that may be deployed to assist witnesses victims or security personnel to help resolve a criminal or suspicious event. In particular some criminal response systems rely on a victim traveling to a security office e.g. an area police station to report a crime or rely on emergency response devices such as blue light units that are located throughout a defined area such as a college campus or a hospital grounds or another large place of employment public access or entertainment that covers a large geographic area. Blue light units may have or be outfitted with sirens flashing lights or speakers to bring attention to an area during an incident. Such blue light units require that a victim interact with the unit e.g. by calling a number or pushing a button or sequence of buttons to alert a central security office of a criminal act.

Unfortunately the circumstances of some criminal acts do not provide victims with such an opportunity to run off and interact with a blue light unit. Also waiting until the perpetrator has left the scene can result in the victim either not reporting the criminal act which happens often or leaving the security personnel with the difficult task of first identifying the perpetrator and then tracking down the perpetrator.

In short many security systems for defined areas again such as college campuses hospitals and other places of employment or public access or entertainment venues that cover a large geographic area are currently monitored by security cameras and the systems rely on the cameras to capture a criminal act and to immediately alert a security person of the criminal act. Unfortunately however individual cameras in such camera based security systems are either sometimes unknowingly not operational or provide such a large amount of information e.g. dozens or hundreds of monitoring screens that the security personnel at the security headquarters are unable to effectively monitor all cameras in real time. In this case the camera based security system provides value but primarily only in seeking to investigate a criminal or suspicious event after it has occurred.

There is a need therefore for a security response system that more quickly and effectively responds to an emergency.

In accordance with an embodiment the invention provides a personal security system for use with a personal communication device is disclosed that is capable of sending position information regarding the location of the device to a remote computer aided dispatch system. The computer aided dispatch system is coupled to a plurality of security resources within a defined geographic area and includes a dynamic resource database that includes security resource location information regarding each of a plurality of security resources a triggering event reception unit for receiving triggering event location data from the personal communication device and an identification unit for identifying responsive to the triggering event location data at least one security resource that is proximate the triggering event.

In accordance with another embodiment the invention provides a method of providing personal security. The method includes the steps of providing a computer aided dispatch system that is coupled to a plurality of security resources within a defined geographic area providing a dynamic resource database that includes security resource location information regarding each of the plurality of security resources receiving triggering event location data from a personal communication device responsive to a triggering event and determining responsive to the triggering event location data at least one security resource that is proximate the triggering event.

In accordance with a further embodiment the invention provides a personal security system for use with a personal communication device that is capable of sending position information regarding the location of the device as well as a digital image of an event to a remote computer aided dispatch system. The computer aided dispatch system is coupled to a plurality of security resources within a defined geographic area and includes a dynamic resource database a computer system and a display. The dynamic resource database includes security resource location information regarding each of a plurality of security resources. The computer system is employed to identify responsive to the triggering event location data received from the personal communication device at least one security resource that is proximate the triggering event. The display is employed to display the digital image at the computer aided dispatch system.

The invention involves in part providing a security response system that effectively and efficiently utilizes existing security equipment and personnel within a monitored environment.

It has been discovered that video from CCTV cameras may be used to actively intercept criminal or suspicious activities if there is a way for a signal to be sent to the security monitoring control room SMCR indicating which CCTV camera s a security person or security equipment should be looking at or recording during the time when an incident of interest is occurring. The present invention provides a system and method that generates such a signal to be sent to the SMCR that may be generated by a person using a smartphone or other device to send a message to the SMCR to indicate the location area of an event of interest.

A security system in accordance with an embodiment of the invention includes a personal communication device that transmits data regarding a user s location longitude latitude and optionally altitude as well as optionally the rate of movement and direction or movement of the user to a resource control system. The personal communication device such as a smart phone either includes an application that directly contacts the SMCR and provides the user s location information or includes a pre programmed telephone number and directly calls the SMCR again providing the user s location information.

When a security incident is reported a central security person may respond accordingly as discussed in more detail below. An incident may be reported by either having a person victim or witness activate a switch e.g. either a help switch or an escort switch that remains activated until the user confirms safe travel to their destination such as a car or dorm room.

For example with reference to a system in accordance with an embodiment of the invention may involve a witness that uses a personal communication device such as a smartphone to capture an image of a criminal event that is occurring such as an attack on a victim by a perpetrator . A report of the incident is transmitted as shown at to a Computer Aided Dispatch System CADS that includes a computer system as well as resource controllers . The computer system may include any of conventional main frame desktop laptop or tablet computers that are connected to the resource controllers as well as to a network such as the Internet and or conventional telephone networks. The record may include photo video audio text description etc. and proximity data about the event. Proximity data may include location of witness or event such as longitude latitude and elevation time and motion data such as speed acceleration and direction northwesterly etc. .

The data record that is created by the witness is transmitted or queued for transmission to Computer Aided Dispatch System CADS where information in the data record is used to monitor focus record or remediate the event by determining and utilizing the Best Available Resources BAR . As shown at in and in Table 1 below the Best Available Resources may include cameras CCTVs blue light units security officers on foot security officers in patrol cars ambulance s and fire truck s . The most recent location availability longitude latitude and optionally elevation and if moving the speed and direction of each of these resources must be known and maintained in the database.

The database may be stored on a local computer or on an in the cloud server. The database is structured to organize a set of tables of LAT LON location data points which may optionally include elevation also into geographic polygons which represent a perimeter mapping of the areas of interest per resource. For example geographic polygons would define a field of view area for each individual CCTV camera.

Again with reference to the CADS computer uses a record of the event to query the DRD to determine the Best Available Resources. The CADS computer then uses the location of the event proximity data and the most recent location data for each available resource to determine which are the closest available Best Available resources such as for example video camera CCTV video camera CCTV and blue light unit BLUE . There are many nearest neighbor algorithms known to those skilled in the art may be employed to mathematically determine the distances between two objects of known locations or the nearest point in a view range of a particular CCTV camera and calculate which objects are the closest to the location of the event. The CADS computer then directs the resource controllers to activate control monitor and focus the Best Available Resource on the event and or informs human dispatcher to review the CADS display . In the case of a CCTV camera the CADS computer may control the displaying of live or recorded video footage from camera s near the incident by sending commands to a VMS API.

With reference to a polygon area is defined for each camera in a personal security system. The area may be defined by having a person stand is designated points e.g. 3 4 or 5 locations that together with straight lines connecting the points define the boundaries of the field of view of each camera. for example shows at a camera for which points and are recorded. Any number of points may be developed for each camera. Table 2 below shows the longitude and latitude for each of the four points and in .

The data is then entered into a database that includes such data for all cameras and other equipment in the defined geographic area. The polygon is defined by straight lines that connect the camera to point then point to point then point to point then point to the camera . If a person is then standing at point and contacts a dispatcher that person s latitude and longitude are sent to the resource controller and the system determines for each camera whether the person whose latitude and longitude for example are 42.165236 and 70.954855 is within the polygon and therefore is within the field of view of the camera .

The determination of whether a person s latitude and longitude are within a range of points for each camera may be achieved by a variety of methods including for example using a Nearest Neighbor Search. As is known in the art a Nearest Neighbor Search is an optimized process for finding closest points in metric spaces such as by using for example a linear search space partitioning locality sensitive hashing vector approximation compression cluster based searches or variations thereof. The process of Nearest Neighbor Interpolation may also be employed for multivarient interpolation of points in one or more dimensions.

In many conventional security offices a dispatcher may at any time be reviewing a large number of video images and or the images may switch at timed intervals between different camera views. In accordance with the present invention when an event is registered the CADS computer causes the closest video camera to the event to show on the CADS display monitor s . The human dispatcher will therefore unavoidably be directly shown the event that is occurring. Each event is therefore monitored recorded and or remediated until the event is concluded.

In accordance with another embodiment and with reference to a user may engage an escort application on a smart phone iPad or other computer tablet device that includes either a peril mode switch or that includes a switch that is held down by the user wherein its release unless cancelled indicates that the user is in danger e.g. a deadman s switch . The user who had previously registered with the application and provided personal information to the application would engage the escort application upon leaving a school workplace or other safe area. The person referred to herein as a Walker opens the personal security application on their smart phone and chooses to activate Escort Me mode. Once Walker begins Escort Mode a proximity data record is created noting walk details such as current location time direction and speed etc. The proximity data record is sent to CADS or is queued for sending later when connectivity allows.

A report of an incident e.g. an assault by a perpetrator is transmitted to the Computer Aided Dispatch System CADS . Proximity data may include location of witness or event such as longitude latitude and elevation time and motion data such as speed acceleration direction northwesterly etc. . The data record that is created by the victim or witness is transmitted or queued for transmission to Computer Aided Dispatch System CADS where information in the data record is used to monitor focus record or remediate the event by determining and utilizing the Best Available Resources BAR .

Again the Best Available Resources may include cameras blue light units security officers on foot security officers in patrol cars ambulance s and fire truck s . The location availability longitude latitude and optionally elevation and if moving the speed and direction of each of these resources must be known and maintained in the database.

The CADS computer uses a record of the event to query the DRD to determine the Best Available Resources. The CADS computer then uses the location of the event proximity data and communicates with the resource controllers to engage the closest available resources such as for example video camera CCTV video camera CCTV blue light unit BLUE and patrol car upon determining that these resources are the closest available Best Available resources. The CADS computer then activates controls monitors and focuses the Best Available Resource on the event or informs a human dispatcher to review the CADS display as discussed above.

In certain further embodiments the escort application on the Walker s smartphone may continuously and periodically generate and send updated proximity data longitude latitude and elevation data records to the CADS computer creating a log of how Walker s journey began and progressed. As the CADS computer receives updated Walker data the CADS computer continuously updates its list of Best Available Resources. Optionally a human dispatcher could activate the Best Available Resources such as CCTV camera to record or view segments of the Walker s journey.

If the Walker s escort application enters Peril Mode either from a deadman switch and timeout or from the Walker manually or vocally selecting Peril Mode then the CADS computer makes available a list of Replay Resources to view Walker s current environment surroundings or to replay such images for the time period prior to the Peril Mode being activated. Optionally the Escort Me application may also record audio or video for all or part of the journey or from the time that the Peril Mode was activated. The Peril Mode could optionally be triggered upon entering or leaving a defined area. The human dispatcher would then use quick access to the Best Available Resources such as video CCTVs to record monitor and or remediate the Peril Mode event.

In accordance with a further embodiment the system may provide predicted path escort application in which a Trigger Condition causes a mobile device MD to transmit a Proximity Information Record PIR including details regarding the location of the MD to a CADS computer which uses the PIR to determine and bring attention to certain security resources SR that are nearby the MD along the path traveled recently by the MD or along a predicted path of travel for the MD. A triggering event may be any of traveling off of the path or having speed of travel suddenly stop or become very slow or very fast running or a manual button push or release as discussed above.

With reference to the system may provide that a Walker having a smart phone iPad or other computer tablet is walking from for example a place of work along a path to a destination such as a car. Again proximity data may include longitude latitude and elevation time and motion data such as speed acceleration and direction. The data record that is created by the witness is transmitted or queued for transmission to Computer Aided Dispatch System CADS where information in the data record is used to monitor focus record or remediate an event by determining and utilizing the Best Available Resources BAR as discussed herein.

Again the Best Available Resources may include cameras blue light units security officers on foot security officers in patrol cars ambulances and fire trucks. The location availability longitude latitude elevation and if moving the speed and direction of each of these resources must be known and maintained in the database.

The CADS computer uses a record of an event to query the DRD to determine the Best Available Resources. The CADS computer then uses the location of the event proximity data and communicates with the resource controllers to determine the closest available security resources such as for example video cameras blue light units patrol cars sirens lights security personnel or equipment defibrillator etc. upon determining that these resources are the closest available Best Available resources. The CADS computer then activates controls monitors and focuses the Best Available Resource on the event or informs a human dispatcher to review the CADS display as discussed above. The proximity information record PIR may include longitude and latitude and or FIPS or other area identifiers time stamp location history movement status speed direction elevation etc. A trigger condition may also be an absolute speed or motion detected e.g. shaking the MD or a direction of an unexpected relative change to speed motion or direction etc.

A Predicted Path Algorithm may anticipate the near term future location s of MD based upon characteristics known about path of journey already recorded or by an indicator of destination entered by a person carrying MD or by recognition and recall of path s taken in the past historically when a person with an MD embarked on a similar journey. The Best Available Resources are determined by correlating PIR to the pre defined database of SR s including SR location availability and capabilities e.g. focal range .

The cameras for use in the above embodiments should have their operational view ranges surveyed and mapped out with the range areas defined in the database. This includes fully exercising the pan tilt and zoom capabilities of each camera to ensure that the database encompasses the full view range of each camera. This may be done by using a location device again such as person holding a smart phone to move around the area associated with each camera and have a central dispatch person note when the person holding the smart phone is visible. The data provided by these maps is employed by the database and may be represented as a set of geographic perimeter defining polygons utilizing LAT LON and optionally elevation points that represent the field of view for each camera.

The location data from the incident is compared to the field of view polygons to determine which camera s are nearby the incident report location. Common API tools exist to determine if a given LAT LON point falls within a polygon. One example of such an API is the GIS Geographic Information Systems Extension for MySQL sold by MySQL AB of Sweden specifically the intersects function which takes as parameters a point and a polygon. The intersects function returns whether the point falls within the polygon or not. If it does it is known which camera is associated with that particular field of view polygon and the appropriate instruction may be sent to the CADS or VMS to display that camera s video. Another API tool that may be used in certain applications is Google Maps API sold by Google Inc. of Mountain View Calif. which can determine if a given LAT LON point falls within a polygon record of LAT LON points.

As shown in the triggering event data may include a portion that provides longitude data a portion that provides latitude data and a portion that provides elevation data. In further embodiments the triggering event data may also include personal information regarding the owner of the personal communication device that is sending the triggering event data as well as a photographic image that has been taken by the device as discussed above with reference to .

As shown in security resource location data for a plurality of security resources blue lights cameras patrol cars foot patrol may include longitude data latitude data and elevation data . The cameras may each include a large number of location point entries associated with the field of view of the camera. In some embodiments this data may be provided by representing the data as a set of ranges of locations corresponding to the field of view of the camera. The non fixed security resources will also include direction of movement data as well as speed of movement data .

As shown in a process of identifying the closest security resource begins step by identifying the blue light with the closest longitude data to that of the triggering event data step . The process then identifies the blue light with the closest latitude data to that of the triggering event data step . These may be the same blue light or may be different blue lights. If two are identified both are considered to be close.

Next the process identifies the camera with the closest longitude data to that of the triggering event data step and then the camera with the closest latitude data to that of the triggering event data step . Again the camera data may be stored as an array of point locations or as a set of ranges of longitude and latitude data. These may be the same camera or may be different cameras. If two are identified both are considered to be close and images from one or both cameras are immediately displayed on the Computer Aided Dispatch System Monitor.

The process then identifies the patrol car with the closest longitude data to that of the triggering event data step and then the patrol car with the closest latitude data to that of the triggering event data step . Again these may be the same patrol car or may be different patrol cars and if two are identified both are considered to be close.

The process then determines whether the foot patrol personnel is close step and determines which security resource is closest to the triggering event location step and or which one or more stand out as being clearly the closest . A signal that includes the triggering event location is also sent to the closest patrol personnel step . The process then loops back step to the identifying the closest security resource since at least the victim and the non fixed security resources may move.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that numerous modifications and variations may be made to the above disclosed embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
