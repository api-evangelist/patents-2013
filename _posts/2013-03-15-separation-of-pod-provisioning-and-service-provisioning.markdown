In one embodiment one or more of these modules can be provided by cloud management functionality or IaaS platform in cloud infrastructure system . The various modules of the cloud infrastructure system depicted in are meant for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of embodiments of the present invention. Alternative embodiments may include more or fewer modules than those shown in .

In an exemplary operation at 1 a customer using a client device such as client device or may interact with cloud infrastructure system by browsing the various services provided by cloud infrastructure system and placing an order for a subscription for one or more services offered by cloud infrastructure system . In certain embodiments the customer may access store UI or cloud UI and place a subscription order via these user interfaces.

The order information received by cloud infrastructure system in response to the customer placing an order may include information identifying the customer and one or more services offered by the cloud infrastructure system that the customer intends to subscribe to. A single order may include orders for multiple services. For instance a customer may login to cloud UI and request a subscription for a CRM service and a Java cloud service in the same order.

Additionally the order may also include one or more service levels for the ordered services. As used herein and as will be discussed in greater detail below a service level for a service determines the amount of resources to be allocated for providing the requested service in the context of the subscription such as the amount of storage amount of computing resources data transfer facilities and the like. For example a basic service level may provide a minimum level of storage data transmission or number of users and higher service levels may include additional resources.

In addition in some instances the order information received by cloud infrastructure system may include information indicative of a customer level and the time period during which the service is desired. The customer level specifies the priority of the customer making the subscription request. In one example the priority may be determined based on the quality of service that the cloud infrastructure system guarantees or promises the customer as specified by a Service Level Agreement SLA agreed to between the customer and the provider of the cloud services. In one example the different customer levels include a basic level a silver level and a gold level. The time period for a service may specify the start date and time for the service and the time period for which the service is desired e.g. a service end date and time may be specified .

In one embodiment a customer may request a new subscription via store UI or request for a trial subscription via cloud UI . In certain embodiments store UI may represent the service provider s eCommerce store front e.g. www.oracle.com store for Oracle Cloud services . Cloud UI may represent a business interface for the service provider. Consumer can explore available services and sign up for interested services through cloud UI . Cloud UI captures user input necessary for ordering trial subscriptions provided by cloud infrastructure system . Cloud UI may also be used to view account features and configure the runtime environment located within cloud infrastructure system . In addition to placing an order for a new subscription store UI may also enable the customer to perform other subscription related tasks such as changing the service level of a subscription extending the term of the subscription increasing the service level of a subscription terminating an existing subscription and the like.

After an order has been placed per 1 at 2 the order information that is received via either store UI or cloud UI is stored in order database which can be one of several databases operated by cloud infrastructure system and utilized in conjunction with other system elements. While order database is shown logically as a single database in in actual implementation this may comprise one or more databases.

At 3 the order is forwarded to order management module . Order management module is configured to perform billing and accounting functions related to the order such as verifying the order and upon verification booking the order. In certain embodiments order management module may include a contract management module and an install base module. The contract management module may store contract information associated with the customer s subscription order such as the customer s service level agreement SLA with cloud infrastructure system . The install base module may include detailed descriptions of the services in the customer s subscription order. In addition to order information the install base module may track installation details related to the services product status and support service history related to the services. As a customer orders new services or upgrades existing ones the install base module may automatically add new order information.

At 4 information regarding the order is communicated to TAS module . In one embodiment TAS module utilizes the order information to orchestrate the provisioning of services and resources for the order placed by the customer. At 5 TAS component orchestrates the provisioning of resources to support the subscribed services using the services of SDI module . At 6 TAS module provides information related to the provisioned order received from SDI module to services module . In some embodiments at 7 SDI module may also use services provided by services module to allocate and configure the resources needed to fulfill the customer s subscription order.

At 8 services module sends a notification to the customers on client devices and regarding the status of the order.

In certain embodiments TAS module functions as an orchestration component that manages business processes associated with each order and applies business logic to determine whether an order should proceed to provisioning. In one embodiment upon receiving an order for a new subscription TAS module sends a request to SDI module to allocate resources and configure those resources needed to fulfill the subscription order. SDI module enables the allocation of resources for the services ordered by the customer. SDI module provides a level of abstraction between the cloud services provided by cloud infrastructure system and the physical implementation layer that is used to provision the resources for providing the requested services. TAS module may thus be isolated from implementation details such as whether or not services and resources are actually provisioned on the fly or pre provisioned and only allocated assigned upon request.

In certain embodiments a user may use store UI to directly interact with order management module to perform billing and accounting related functions such as verifying the order and upon verification booking the order. In some embodiments instead of a customer placing an order at 9 the order may instead be placed by sales personnel on behalf of the customer such as a customer s service representative or sales representative. Sales personnel may directly interact with order management module via a user interface not shown in provided by order management module for placing orders or for providing quotes for the customer. This for example may be done for large customers where the order may be placed by the customer s sales representative through order management module . The sales representative may set up the subscription on behalf of the customer.

EM module is configured to monitor activities related to managing and tracking a customer s subscription in cloud infrastructure system . EM module collects usage statistics for the services in the subscription order such as the amount of storage used the amount data transferred the number of users and the amount of system up time and system down time. At 10 a host operator personnel who may be an employee of a provider of cloud infrastructure system may interact with EM module via an enterprise manager user interface not shown in to manage systems and resources on which services are provisioned within cloud infrastructure system .

Identity management IDM module is configured to provide identity services such as access management and authorization services in cloud infrastructure system . In one embodiment IDM module controls information about customers who wish to utilize the services provided by cloud infrastructure system . Such information can include information that authenticates the identities of such customers and information that describes which actions those customers are authorized to perform relative to various system resources e.g. files directories applications communication ports memory segments etc. IDM module can also include the management of descriptive information about each customer and about how and by whom that descriptive information can be accessed and modified.

In one embodiment information managed by the identity management module can be partitioned to create separate identity domains. Information belonging to a particular identity domain can be isolated from all other identity domains. Also an identity domain can be shared by multiple separate tenants. Each such tenant can be a customer subscribing to services in the cloud infrastructure system . In some embodiments a customer can have one or many identity domains and each identity domain may be associated with one or more subscriptions each subscription having one or many services. For example a single customer can represent a large entity and identity domains may be created for divisions departments within this large entity. EM module and IDM module may in turn interact with order management module at 11 and 12 respectively to manage and track the customer s subscriptions in cloud infrastructure system .

In one embodiment at 13 support services may also be provided to the customer via a support UI . In one embodiment support UI enables support personnel to interact with order management module via a support backend system to perform support services at 14 . Support personnel in the cloud infrastructure system as well as customers can submit bug reports and check the status of these reports via support UI .

Other interfaces not shown in may also be provided by cloud infrastructure system . For example an identity domain administrator may use a user interface to IDM module to configure domain and user identities. In addition customers may log into a separate interface for each service they wish to utilize. In certain embodiments a customer who wishes to subscribe to one or more services offered by cloud infrastructure system may also be assigned various roles and responsibilities. In one embodiment the different roles and responsibilities that may be assigned for a customer may include that of a buyer an account administrator a service administrator an identity domain administrator or a user who utilizes the services and resources offered by cloud infrastructure system . The different roles and responsibilities are described more fully in below.

At a customer s subscription order is processed. The processing may include validating the order in one example. Validating the order includes ensuring that the customer has paid for the subscription and ensuring that the customer does not already have subscriptions with the same name or that the customer is not attempting to create multiple subscriptions of the same type in the same identity domain for subscription types for which this is disallowed such as in the case of a CRM service . Processing may also include tracking the status of an order for each order that is being processed by cloud infrastructure system .

At a business process associated with the order is identified. In some instances multiple business processes may be identified for an order. Each business process identifies a series of steps for processing various aspects of the order. As an example a first business process may identify one or more steps related to provisioning physical resources for the order a second business process may identify one or more steps related to creating an identity domain along with customer identities for the order a third business process may identify one or more steps for related to performing back office functions such as creating a customer record for the user performing accounting functions related to the order and the like. In certain embodiments different business processes may also be identified for processing different services in an order. For example different business process may be identified to process a CRM service and a database service.

At the business process identified for the order in is executed. Executing the business process associated with the order may include orchestrating the series of steps associated with the business process identified in step . For example executing a business process related to provisioning physical resources for the order may include sending a request to SDI module to allocate resources and configure those resources needed to fulfill the subscription order.

At a notification is sent to the customer regarding the status of the provisioned order. Additional description related to performing steps and is provided in detail in .

In one embodiment order processing module receives an order from a customer from one or more input sources . For example order processing module may directly receive an order via cloud UI or store UI in one embodiment. Alternatively order processing module may receive an order from order management module or order database . Order processing module then processes the order. In certain embodiments processing the order includes generating a customer record which includes information about the order such as a service type a service level a customer level the type of resources the amount of the resources to be allocated to the service instance and a time period during which the service is desired. As part of the processing order processing module also determines whether the order is a valid order. This includes ensuring that the customer does not already have subscriptions with the same name or that the customer is not attempting to create multiple subscriptions of the same type in the same identity domain for subscription types where this is disallowed such as in the case of a fusion CRM service .

Order processing module may also perform additional processing on the order. Processing may include tracking the status of an order for each order that is being processed by cloud infrastructure system . In one embodiment order processing module may process each order to identify a number of states pertaining to the order. In one example the different states of an order may be an initialized state a provisioned state an active state an administration required state an error state and the like. An initialized state refers to the state of a new order a provisioned state refers to the state of an order once the services and resources for the order have been provisioned. An order is in an active state when the order has been processed by TAS module and a notification to that effect has been delivered to the customer. An order is in an administration required state when intervention by an administrator is needed to resolve the issue. The order is in an error state when the order cannot be processed. In addition to maintaining the order progress status order processing module also maintains detailed information about any failures encountered during process execution. In other embodiments and as will be discussed in detail below the additional processing performed by order processing module may also include changing the service level for a service in the subscription changing the services included in the subscription extending the time period of the subscription and canceling the subscription or specifying different service levels for different time periods in the subscription.

After an order has been processed by order processing module business logic is applied to determine whether the order should proceed to provisioning. In one embodiment as part of orchestrating the order business process identifier receives the processed order from order processing module and applies business logic to identify a particular business process to use for the order being processed. In one embodiment business process identifier may utilize information stored in a service catalog to determine the particular business process to be used for the order. In one embodiment and as discussed in multiple business processes may be identified for an order and each business process identifies a series of steps for processing various aspects of the order. In another embodiment and as discussed above different business processes may be defined for different types of services or combinations of services such as a CRM service or a database service. In one embodiment service catalog may store information mapping an order to a particular type of business process. Business process identifier may use this information to identify a specific business process for the order being processed.

Once a business process has been identified business process identifier communicates the particular business process to be executed to business process executor . Business process executor then executes steps of the identified business process by operating in conjunction with one or more modules in the cloud infrastructure system . In some embodiments business process executor acts as an orchestrator for performing the steps associated with a business process. For example the business process executor may interact with order processing module to execute steps in a business process that identifies workflows related to the order determines the overage of services in the order or identifies service components related to the order.

In one example business process executor interacts with SDI module to execute steps in a business process for allocating and provisioning resources for services requested in the subscription order. In this example for each step in the business process business process executor may send a request to SDI component to allocate resources and configure resources needed to fulfill the particular step. SDI component is responsible for the actual allocation of the resources. Once all the steps of the business processes of an order have been executed business process executor may send a notification to the customer of the processed order by utilizing the services of services component . The notification may include sending an email notification to the customer with details of the processed order. The email notification may also include deployment information related to the order to enable the customer to access the subscribed services.

In certain embodiments TAS module may provide one or more TAS Application Programming Interfaces APIs that enable TAS module to interact with other modules in cloud infrastructure system and for other modules to interact with TAS module . For example the TAS APIs may include a system provisioning API that interacts with SDI module via an asynchronous Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP based web services call to provision resources for the customer s subscription order. In one embodiment TAS module may also utilize the system provisioning API to accomplish system and service instance creation and deletion switch a service instance to an increased service level and associate service instances. An example of this is the association of a Java service instance to a fusion applications service instance to allow secure web service communications. The TAS APIs may also include a notification API that interacts with the services module to notify the customer of a processed order. In certain embodiments the TAS module also periodically propagates subscription information outages and notifications e.g. planned downtime to services component .

In certain embodiments TAS module periodically receives usage statistics for each of the provisioned services such as the amount of storage used the amount data transferred the number of users and the amount of system up time and system down time from EM module . Overage framework utilizes the usage statistics to determine whether over use of a service has occurred and if so to determine how much to bill for the overage and provides this information to order management module .

In certain embodiments TAS module includes an order workflow identification module that is configured to identify one or more workflows associated with processing a customer s subscription order. In certain embodiments TAS module may include a subscription order generation framework for generating subscription orders for a customer when the customer places a subscription order for one or more services offered by the cloud infrastructure system . In one embodiment a subscription order includes one or more service components responsible for providing the services requested by a customer in the subscription order.

Additionally TAS module may also interact with one or more additional databases such as a Tenant Information System TIS database to enable the provisioning of resources for one or more services subscribed by the customer while taking into consideration historical information if any available for the customer. TIS database may include historical order information and historical usage information pertaining to orders subscribed by the customer.

TAS module may be deployed using different deployment models. In certain embodiments the deployment includes a central component that interfaces with one or more distributed components. The distributed components may for example be deployed as various data centers and accordingly may also be referred to as data center components. The central component includes capabilities to process orders and co ordinate services in cloud infrastructure system while the data center components provide capabilities for provisioning and operating the runtime system that provides the resources for the subscribed services.

In one embodiment the responsibilities of TAS central component include without limitation to provide a centralized component for receiving customer orders performing order related business operations such as creating a new subscription changing the service level for a service in the subscription changing the services included in the subscription and extending the time period of the subscription or canceling the subscription. The responsibilities of TAS central component may also include maintaining and serving subscription data needed by cloud infrastructure system and interfacing with order management module support UI cloud UI and store UI to handle all the back office interactions.

In one embodiment the responsibilities of TAS DCs and include without limitation performing runtime operations for orchestrating the provisioning the resources for one or more services subscribed by the customer. TAS DCs and also include capabilities to perform operations such as locking unlocking enabling or disabling a subscription order collecting metrics related to the order determining the status of the order and sending notification events related to the order.

In an exemplary operation of the distributed TAS system shown in TAS central component initially receives an order from a customer via cloud UI store UI via order management system or via order database . In one embodiment the customer represents a buyer who has financial information and the authority to order and or change a subscription. In one embodiment the order information includes information identifying the customer the type of services that the customer wishes to subscribe to and an account administrator who will be responsible for handling the request. In certain embodiments the account administrator may be nominated by the customer when the customer places an order for a subscription to one or more services offered by cloud infrastructure system . Based on the order information the TAS central component identifies the data region of the world such as Americas EMEA or Asia Pacific in which the order originates and the particular TAS DCs for e.g. or that will be deployed for provisioning the order. In one embodiment the particular TAS DC for e.g. from among DCs or that will be deployed for provisioning the order is determined based on the geographical data region in which the request originated.

TAS central component then sends the order request to the particular TAS DC in which to provision services for the order request. In one embodiment TAS DCs or identify a service administrator and an identity domain administrator responsible for processing the order request at the particular TAS DC. The service administrator and the identity administrator may be nominated by the account administrator identified in the subscription order. TAS DCs or communicate with SDI module to orchestrate the provisioning of physical resources for the order. SDI component in respective TAS DCs or allocates resources and configures those resources needed to fulfill the subscription order.

In certain embodiments TAS DCs or identify an identity domain associated with the subscription. SDI component may provide the identity domain information to IDM component shown in for identifying an existing identity domain or creating a new identity domain. Once the order is provisioned by the SDI module at respective TAS DCs or TAS central component may place information regarding the provisioned resources in a support system via support UI . Information may include for example displaying resource metrics related to the services and usage statistics of the services.

Once in operation at each data center EM module to periodically collects usage statistics for each of the provisioned services provisioned at that data center such as the amount of storage used the amount data transferred the number of users and the amount of system up time and system down time. These statistics are provided to the TAS DC that is local to EM module i.e. at the same data center . In an embodiment the TAS DCs may use the usage statistics to determine whether overuse of a service has occurred and if so to determine how much to bill for the overage and provide the billing information to order management system .

In one embodiment and as discussed in SDI connector module includes one or more connectors for handling the deployment of tasks specified by SDI task manager module to provision resources for the services in the subscription order.

As described above with respect to SDI task manager module translates each step specified in a business process into a series of tasks by utilizing the services of SDI connector module which may include one or more connectors for handling the deployment of tasks specified by SDI task manager module to provision one or more services related to the order request. One or more of the connectors may handle tasks that are specific to a particular service type while other connectors may handle tasks that are common across different service types. In one embodiment SDI connector module includes a set of connectors wrapper APIs that interface with one or more of the external modules shown in in cloud infrastructure system to provision the services and resources related to the order request. For example a NUVIAQ connector interfaces with VAB module to provision Java services.

In certain embodiments Nuviaq system may be configured to provide a runtime engine for orchestrating PaaS operations. Nuviaq system may provide a web service API to facilitate integration with other products and services. Nuviaq system also provides support for complex workflows in system provisioning application deployment and associated lifecycle operations and integrates with management and monitoring solutions.

In the embodiment depicted in Nuviaq system comprises a Nuviaq proxy a Nuviaq manager and a Nuviaq database . In certain embodiments Nuviaq manager provides an entry point into Nuviaq system providing secure access to PaaS operations via the web service API. Internally it tracks system state in the database and controls job execution on the workflow engine. In a public cloud Nuviaq manager may be accessed by the Tenant Provisioning system SDI and the Tenant Console to drive provisioning and deployment operations respectively.

In one embodiment Nuviaq manager executes jobs asynchronously via an internal workflow engine. A job may be a sequence of actions specific to a given PaaS workflow. Actions may be performed in order with failure in any step resulting in failure of the overall job. Many workflow actions delegate to external systems relevant to the workflow such as the EM command line interface cli . In one implementation Nuviaq manager application may be hosted in a 2 node WebLogic cluster with associated HTTP server e.g. Oracle HTTP Server or OHS instance running inside a firewall.

In certain embodiments Nuviaq proxy is the public access point to the Nuviaq API. In one embodiment only Public API may be exposed here. Requests received by proxy may be forwarded to Nuviaq manager . In one embodiment Nuviaq proxy runs outside the firewall whereas manager runs within the firewall. In one implementation Nuviaq proxy application runs on a WebLogic cluster running outside the firewall.

In certain embodiments Nuviaq database tracks various domain entities such as without limitation platform instance deployment plan application WebLogic domain jobs alerts and the like. Primary keys may be aligned with the Service Database where appropriate.

In one embodiment Platform Instance may contain all resources required for a WebLogic service for a given tenant.

Nuviaq system may rely on additional systems of cloud infrastructure system to carry out the workflows used the WebLogic cloud service. These dependencies may include dependencies on SDI IDM a virus scan system a service database CRM instances and the like. For example Nuviaq system may depend upon functions performed by an Assembly Deployer in SDI . In one embodiment the Assembly Deployer is a system to manage interactions with OVAB Oracle Virtual Assembly Builder and OVM Oracle Virtual Machine . Capabilities of the Assembly Deployer used by Nuviaq system may include without limitation functions for deploying an assembly un deploying an assembly describing assembly deployment scaling appliance and the like. In one implementation Nuviaq system accesses the Assembly Deployer via a web service API.

In certain embodiments security policies may require certain artifacts to be scanned for viruses before being deployed to an application. Cloud infrastructure system may provide a virus scan system for this purpose that provides scanning as a service for multiple components of the public cloud.

In certain embodiments a public cloud infrastructure may maintain a Service Database containing information about tenants e.g. customers and their service subscriptions. Nuviaq workflows may access to this data in order to properly configure a WebLogic service as a client to other services that the tenant also subscribes to.

Nuviaq system may depend on IDM for its security integration. In certain embodiments Java Service instances can be associated with a CRM instance. The association allows user applications deployed to their Java Service instance to access a CRM instance though Web Service calls.

Various entities may use services provided by Nuviaq system . These clients of Nuviaq system may include a Tenant Console which is an management server e.g. Oracle Management Server based user interface that customers may access to manage their applications on their platform instances several IDEs such as Oracle IDEs JDeveloper NetBeans and OEPE have been extended to offer access to application lifecycle management operations one or more Command Line Interfaces CLIs that are available to access lifecycle operations on the platform instances.

Provisioning use case for Nuviaq system A Provision Platform Instance use case is realized via the Create Platform Instance operation of the Nuviaq API. In the context of cloud infrastructure system a service instance with respect to the Nuviaq system corresponds to a Nuviaq platform instance. A platform instance is assigned a unique identifier is used on all subsequent operations related to this instance. A Platform Deployment descriptor provided to the Create Platform Instance action allows for properties to be set that modify the configuration of the platform instance to meet the subscription requirements of the tenant. These properties may include for example 

Install Update Application use case The Install Application operation deploys an application to a running WebLogic Server after validating that the application archive meets the security requirements of the Public Cloud. In one embodiment the Application Deployment descriptor provided to the Install Application action allows for properties to be set that modify the configuration of the application to meet the subscription requirements of the tenant. These properties may include for example 

Referring back to in certain embodiments TAS and SDI working in cooperation are responsible for provisioning resources for one or more services ordered by a customer from a set of services offered by cloud infrastructure system . For example in one embodiment for provisioning a database service the automated provisioning flow may be as follows for a paid subscription 

In some embodiments a customer may also be allowed to subscribe to a service on a trial basis. For example such a trial order may be received via cloud UI e.g. using cloud.oracle.com .

In certain embodiments cloud infrastructure system enables underlying hardware and service instances to be shared between customers or tenants. For example the database service may be provisioned as shown in in one embodiment. depicts multiple Exadata compute nodes and each providing a database instance provisioned for the database service. For example compute node provides a database instance for a database service. Each Exadata compute node may have multiple database instances.

In certain embodiments each database instance can comprise multiple schemas and the schemas may be associated with different customers or tenants. For example in database instance provides two schemas and each with its own tables. Schema may be associated with a first customer or tenant subscribing to a database service and schema may be associated with a second customer or tenant subscribing to the database service. Each tenant gets a completely isolated schema. Each schema acts like a container that can manage database objects including tables views stored procedures triggers etc. for the associated tenant. Each schema may have one dedicated tablespace with each tablespace having one data file.

In this manner a single database instance can provide database services to multiple tenants. This not only enables sharing of underlying hardware resources but also enables sharing of service instance between tenants.

In certain embodiments such a multi tenancy system is facilitated by IDM which beneficially enables multiple separate customers each having their own separate identity domains to use hardware and software that is shared in the cloud. Consequently there is no need for each customer to have its own dedicated hardware or software resources and in some cases resources that are not being used by some customers at a particular moment can be used by other customers thereby preventing those resources from being wasted. For example as depicted in a database instance can service multiple customers each with their respective identity domains. Although each such database service instance can be a separate abstraction or view of a single physical multi tenant database system that is shared among the many separate identity domains each such database service instance can have a separate and potentially different schema than each other database service instance has. Thus the multi tenant database system can store mappings between customer specified database schemas and the identity domains to which those database schemas pertain. The multi tenant database system can cause the database service instance for a particular identity domain to use the schema that is mapped to that particular identity domain.

The multi tenancy can also be extended to other services such as the Java Service. For example multiple customers can have a JAVA service instance placed within their respective identity domains. Each such identity domain can have a JAVA virtual machine which can be viewed as being a virtual slice of hardware. In one embodiment a job monitoring service e.g. Hudson can be combined with a JAVA enterprise edition platform e.g. Oracle WebLogic in the cloud to enable each separate identity domain to have its own separate virtual slice of the JAVA enterprise edition platform. Such a job monitoring service can for example monitor the execution of repeated jobs such as building a software project or jobs run by an operating system s time based job scheduler. Such repeated jobs can include the continuous building and or testing of software projects. Additionally or alternatively such repeated jobs can include the monitoring of executions of operating system run jobs that are executed on machines that are remote from the machine on which the job monitoring service executes.

According to some embodiments SDI can coordinate separate POD provisioning and service provisioning for services. A POD is a logical entity that can represent one of the following a pre provisioned anonymous single tenant deployment as is the case for the Java service or a multi tenant stack physical or virtualized that serves multiple tenants as is the case for the database service . For example a POD is a deployment of a service on a physical stack. A POD can house one or more service instances. PODs can be created a priori or can be created on demand when a service instance is created for a given customer.

In some instances a POD is an instantiation of a software stack for running a service. A POD is thus used to run a service. For example a POD corresponding to Java service may comprise a stack of virtual machines. As another example a POD for a database service may comprise an instance of a database. A POD may be considered as a subsystem that is capable of hosting a service. Different pods may be used for different services.

The task of creating a POD for a service is referred to as POD provisioning. As it will be illustrated in POD provisioning can facilitated by SDI module . POD provisioning is the act of creating an anonymous instance of the software component. A POD can be fully installed and wired from an infrastructure point of view. A POD does not have customer specific configuration data or integration e.g. not connected to any customer stripe in LDAP .

A different POD may be created for each service. For example for Java service a POD may map to a set of VMs running middleware technology e.g. running Fusion middleware . Different automated flows may be used by SDI module for POD provisioning. In some instances a POD can also be an almost entirely virtual concept.

An example of a POD can include a set of data center resources that have been wired together to provide a particular service for a particular customer. A POD can include a dedicated resource in shared infrastructure. For example in the case of services that are deployed using VAB technology such as Oracle Virtual Assembly Builder OVAB technology the OVAB assembly is the POD. Another example of a POD can include the core set of VMs that makes up a Java assembly in a domain. For Fusion applications the POD can be the set of virtual machines that are dedicated to that particular installation of fusion applications which can include the database and the VMs. For the database service a POD can include the Exadata along with the DB instances on the Exadata.

Flowchart can be performed for each POD assembly that is pre provisioned. SDI module can use management algorithms and selection algorithms to provision the PODs in the background and then determine a POD for a particular tenant when a request comes in. For example as illustrated in SDI module can pre provision a POD before receiving a customer order. Once a service request is received SDI module can then add customer information to the POD and customize the POD based on the request as illustrated in .

At SDI module can store subscription order information from a customer identifying a service from a set of services. For example the subscription order information can be a customer request from the store UI for a database service. The subscription order information can include customer specific configuration.

At SDI module can determine a service associated with the subscription order information. For example SDI module can determine that the customer order is for a database service. Therefore when a customer order is received SDI module determines the type of service that has been requested in order to map a POD which is service specific to the customer request.

At SDI module can map a pre provisioned anonymous deployment to the subscription order information. The pre provisioned anonymous deployment can be a POD. As discussed herein a POD can be pre provisioned and created for a specific service.

A service can map to the subscription of a particular customer. For example a service can be the Java instance for a particular customer. A service instance is a particular subscription ID for a particular type of service such as a Java service. A service instance can belong to a particular customer and lives on a pod. Only one service instance lives on a single tenant POD and multiple instances can live on a multiple tenant POD. Furthermore the service instance always lives in a POD and never spans two pods. On the other hand the service instance may require more than just the POD to exist.

At SDI module can create a service instance specifically for the customer by configuring the pre provisioned anonymous deployment with the customer specific configuration. For example SDI module can introduce customer specific configuration into the POD using personality injection. Service provisioning is the process of binding a particular customer to a particular POD. This introduces customer specific configuration into the POD e.g. personality injection . A POD may support one or more tenants simultaneously single or multi tenant . In the case of a POD supporting multiple tenants multiple personalities may be injected into the POD one for each supported tenant.

According to another embodiment a particular service can use multiple PODs. For example a Java service can be requested. SDI module can have pre provisioned multiple Java PODs. Based on the requested size of the service SDI module can determine that multiple PODs are needed to support the requested service.

The processes of service provisioning and POD provisioning are separate and independent of each other and are coordinated by SDI module . This enables for example POD provisioning to be performed in the background. Spare pooling of pods may be based on administrator configurable options to anticipate future demand. Service provisioning is generally much faster than POD provisioning and happens on demand when SDI receives an order from TAS. SDI coordinates POD provisioning and service provisioning while also handling the pooling and registration.

According to some embodiments fully automated POD provisioning handled by SDI can create instance of the software component without a request from TAS. This can be a background activity run in advance of customer order. Standing up a POD can be slow therefore POD Provisioning is done ahead of time so when a customer orders a service the customer can receive the order quickly e.g. within seconds or minutes . A POD may support one or more tenants simultaneously single or multi tenant . The processes are independent such that POD provisioning can be performed in the background. Spare pooling of pods is based on administrator configurable options to anticipate future demand.

SDI module can create new PODs if the resources become low. As later discussed by using Min Used thresholds SDI module can monitor usage and allocation. Based on the monitoring SDI can pre provision new PODs.

For example when an SDI timer job runs and notifies SDI module that number of free assemblies for a given service size basic standard enterprise has fallen below the Min Used thresholds specified in the current configuration additional assemblies can be pre provisioned until the thresholds have been reached.

Flowchart can be performed for each pre provisioned assembly. An assembly is one type of POD. For example assembly is a specific technology used by OVAB for creating. OVAB creates assemblies or deploys assemblies. The pre provisioning of PODs can continue indefinitely until the Min used thresholds are reached or until the timer job is suspended by an operator.

Additionally if a failure occurs at any step the preceding operations can be rolled back. SDI module can then retry the sequence again.

At SDI module can acquire IP addresses for pre provisioning a POD assembly. For example eight IP addresses e.g. four from the FRONTEND four from the BACKEND can be reserved in the SDI database. The operation can be atomic. In some instances if the system does not have sufficient IP addresses an administrator can add more capacity to the environment.

At SDI module can create a virtual assembly builder home e.g. Oracle Virtual Assembly Builder OVAB . For example a new directory can be created under the root e.g. ovab.virtual.root directory and various symlinks can be created back to the home directory e.g. ovab.master.home . The home directory can be used as the virtual assembly builder home for the single deployment. This can allows SDI module to perform parallel virtual assembly builder e.g. OVAB operations without locking issues.

At SDI module can create a deployment plan e.g. deploymentPlan.xml file into the new virtual assembly builder e.g. OVAB home. The deployment plan can contain the configuration information that will be injected into virtual machines VMs deployed by virtual assembly builder e.g. OVAB for the deployment such as but not limited to IP addresses network file sharing NFS mounts and VM bridge names.

At SDI module can create ZFS volumes. ZFS is a combined file system and logical volume manager. The features of ZFS include protection against data corruption support for high storage capacities integration of the concepts of file system and volume management snapshots and copy on write clones continuous integrity checking and automatic repair. For example three volumes are created in the ZFS filer for the deployment. The volumes are mounted on each VM booted as part of this deployment.

At SDI module can a deploy command e.g. abct1 deploy to deploy assembly. For example the deploy command can boot one to four VMs via VM Manager.

At SDI module can set the assembly to free in SDI database. For example SDI module can set USED 0 for the PRE PROV JAVA ASSEMBLY row which indicates that the POD assembly is read to be assigned to a service instance.

As previously mentioned standing up a POD can be slow therefore POD assembly is done ahead of time so when a customer orders a service the customer can receive the order quickly e.g. within seconds or minutes . Spare pooling of pods is based on administrator configurable options e.g. Min Used thresholds to anticipate future demand.

SDI module provides the automation for creating and destroying service instances. It also provides monitoring ability of service instances to support specific business activities such as trial expiration.

The service instance creation API can be used to create new systems and or service instances. It can be used to create a new system along with one or more service instances that belong to that system or it can be used to create one or more service instances to a pre existing system. The API can be asynchronous since it may be a long running operation taking minutes or hours depending on our implementation decisions and potential failures that require manual intervention to resolve. Hence this API must take a call back address as one of its arguments. The immediate return value of the call can simply be a request ID that identifies the request for identification for the duration of the fulfillment of the request. The results of the request can be provided via a call back to the address provided. When the callback is made with the response body the system and service instances created by the request can be fully operational and ready for use.

The call back address and the service order document are inputs for the service instance creation API. The call back address can be an address to call back to TAS when the operation has been completed. The service order document can be an XML document that describes an order as processed by the TAS system. The service order document can provide the following information 

The service order fulfillment document can be the output for the service instance creation API. As described above the return value from this asynchronous call can be a request id that can be used for tracking this request during its lifetime. The response to the request can be sent as a callback to the call back address provided as input. The service order fulfillment document can be an XML document that contains the following information 

Additionally SDI module can have the ability to pre deploy and associate service instances. Depending on the length of time required to deploy various service instances the assemblies may be pre deployed for these services. Therefore when a user requests a service instance all that SDI module may need to do is to put any user specific personality into the assembly and return it to the user.

Once a customer request an order an SDI provisioning request is requested by TAS in a single SOAP operation. A Provisioning Request can include a bundle of Systems Services create read update and delete CRUD operations. A Provisioning Request can be uniquely identified by its Request Id.

If the request is not new at SDI module checks the request state e.g. from existing SDI database entry . For example if the state is completed then the request was successfully processed before. Then at SDI module can invoke the relevant TAS orderCompleteCallback. Alternatively if the state is cancelled then the request was unsuccessfully processed before. Then at SDI module can invoke the relevant TAS onFaultCallback with fault information.

If the request is new at the request is continues to be processed. TAS module can be notified when processing completes. SDI module can validate the request. For example there may be three validation categories such as input validation state validation and locks Validation. At if the request is invalid SDI module can invoke the TAS onFaultCallback with the relevant fault information.

If the request is valid at SDI module creates a new request and the state is set to ready. SDI module starts and continues executing the request. For example the next task in the task queue is run after which the next task and so on until all tasks are completed.

At if all the tasks that are associated with this request were successfully executed then SDI module can invoke the relevant TAS orderCompleteCallback with the order fulfillment.

In the error scenarios if a request is not completed and a single task has failed subsequent tasks in the request may not be executed. At SDI module can determine if the error is recoverable. At if the error is non recoverable the request state is changed to a canceled state and SDI module can invoke the TAS onFaultCallback with the relevant fault information. Additionally SDI module can add entry to internal error queue. This queue will be polled by EM module to update dashboard and send an alert email to administrator. At if the error is recoverable SDI module can change the state to a pausing state and from that state to paused state. Additionally SDI module can add entry to internal error queue. This queue will be polled by EM module to update dashboard and send an alert email to administrator.

Once a new request for a service is received and validated by SDI module then SDI module provisions the requested service. illustrates a detail flow of a provisioning example according to some embodiments. The provisioning process is managed by SDI module .

For example TAS can integrate with the system provisioning module from within the BPEL process. Specifically the system provisioning interface can be exposed as an asynchronous SOAP based Web Services call and the TAS BPEL processes for the various lifecycle operations can directly call the system provisioning endpoints to perform the provisioning tasks.

Additionally system provisioning can use callback APIs to send the result to the BPEL process on success or to inform the BPEL process that the operation failed with a fault. On receiving the callbacks the BPEL process either continues its normal flow with the result or follows the fault policy to handle the fault.

At onboarding can be initiated and TAS module can create tenant call. In the tenant the service type and size can be passed. In this example there can be two types because the order is for a Java and database service. The corresponding size for a trial may be equals small. Alternatively the size may be larger if the order was a paid order. The create tenant call gets passed to SDI module for provisioning.

At local candidate machines loop call allows SDI module to look at the available resources to potentially find a pre provisioned POD. Depending on the service type the resources may have been pre pooled and mostly already set up. Alternatively if the service has not been pre provisioned then SDI module may have to start from scratch for provisioning the requested service. For example for the Java service SDI module can support pre provisioning of PODs where the work of creating virtual machines and standing them up is all done in advance. Therefore when a customer request comes in SDI module simply has a smaller step of personality injection. Personal injection includes customizing the pre provisioned POD with the configuration for a particular customer at runtime. For the database service SDI module can create the customer footprint on demand. On the other hand the customer footprint can be a fairly virtual footprint since the database service is using schemas within an existing database. For fusion applications the personality injection can include rewiring the configuration to match a particular customer s details. In this example SDI module can choose existing VMs pre provisioned for the Java service or provisioning a new Java service which includes pick a rack that has enough resources to stand up a new VM.

At SDI module can update registry. SDI module can have bookkeeping on board the physical hardware resources to keep track of the underlying virtual machine manager and the virtual machine pools. Additionally SDI module can keep track of all of the assemblies and VMs that have been created and whether they are for example an anonymous assembly that has not been assigned to a customer or an assembly that is bound to a particular customer subscription.

At the Build ID flows back to the onboarding layer. This can inform TAS module that a system that is being produced or a service is being produced for a particular request. TAS module can asynchronously determine whether the provisioning is done. At TAS module can poll SDI module and check whether or not a particular request is complete. Alternatively an asynchronous SOAP request by TAS module can also determine if the request is complete where TAS waits for a call back.

At SDI module can use an API e.g. OVAB Java API to deploy the weblogic server WLS assembly. For example OVAB can internally make calls to a VM manager in order to create the individual VMs in the assembly. Additionally OVAB can have additional logic when there are multiple VMs in order to interface the multiple VMs in order for the VMs to support a whole WLS domain topology. At and SDI module can create the WLS machine pool and DB machine pool. Once the WLS assembly is actually deployed and comes back successfully through VM manager and back through OVAB SDI module can determine that an anonymous assembly has been created.

Additionally the anonymous assembly can be incorporated with Nuviaq based personality injection. For example SDI module can call the Nuviaq connector and pass physical details and customer specific details in order for Nuviaq to make runtime calls to the running VMs. Nuviaq can reconfigure the web logic domain to match the customer specific information e.g. the identity domain name chosen by the customer into the URLs .

At SDI module can provision a database service. For example the database service can be backed by Exadata hardware database instances that can be preconfigured on Exadata hardware. As further described in each instance can support many customers. SDI module can register the Exadatas with the DB service itself and manage the Exadata PODs. Furthermore SDI module can provision the database service using an APEX connector. APEX is application express programming engine on top of the database. The SDI module can pass along relevant information to the APEX connector to provision the database such as the size of the database service the customer identity domain name and so on. Then the APEX connector can allocate additional schemas and table spaces for the customer on the fly. Additionally a particular Exadata machine may be chosen based on load and sizing and so on. The actual schema is returned back to SDI module which can include the connecting information to the schema. SDI module can generates a random credential and passes the credential back to TAS module .

At SDI module can initiate a soft HTTP server e.g. OHS restart. SDI module can dynamically generates configuration files with the specific binding for a specific customer which can require a soft restart of OHS. A soft restart allows all the in flight requests to be completed before restarting. Once the OHS is restarted then inbound traffic to the POD through the routing tier is possible.

At a response is sent back to TAS module with the URL for the requested service and the passwords that were generated. The password can be the service administrator or the identity domain administrator password that can be provided to the customer via e mail for access to the service environment.

The platform deployment descriptor provided to the create platform instance action allows for properties to be set that modify the configuration of the platform instance to meet the subscription requirements of the tenant. Properties can be used for the following purposes specify the subscription type size the subscription type size can impact the number of servers database limits and quality of service settings indicate whether or not this is a trial subscription and identify a CRM service to be associated with this WebLogic service instance.

According to one embodiment SDI module can use a continuous integration server e.g. Hudson as the configuration manager. Continuous integration server allow for automating build and deployment. Additionally continuous integration server can enable interface with cloud services and virtualization technologies such that users can improve resource utilization reduce maintenance overhead and respond automatically to sudden system load spikes.

At TAS module can send a tenant request for Java service to SDI module . At SDI module can request for anonymous assembly from an assembly builder via the assembly builder connector. At the assembly builder can deploy the anonymous assembly using OVM. At the anonymous assembly is sent to SDI module . At SDI module can create IDM slice via the IDM connector. At IDM can return the IDM coordinates to SDI module . At SDI module can create a database slice via the database connector. At the database can return the database coordinate to SDI module . In some instances the database can be an APEX database service.

At SDI module can request to configure Java service with the received IDM database and EM coordinates via the Nuviaq connector. At Nuviaq can store all the service instance data into a Nuviaq database. At Nuviaq can configure Java service instance which may also include starting the EM agent. In some instances Nuviaq can be a Java service orchestrator.

Furthermore using Fusion applications FA SaaS environment can require Java service to be properly provisioned according to the FA SaaS tenant. Therefore the provisioning process described in may have to account for certain differences related to Identity Management.

In a typical cloud PaaS e.g. Java service database service provisioning environment there can be single shared IDM servicing all tenants. Each tenant s security information can be segregated in a IDM stripe e.g. identity domain which can be kept separate from the other tenants. In the case of FA SaaS the IDM may be different and dedicated to each SaaS instance. Therefore the integration of the Java service and FA service can require that there is an interaction between the IDMs in order to support functionality like single sign on.

According to some embodiments during the provisioning of associated services SDI module can use a shared IDM between SaaS and PaaS services. Based on the shared IDM between SaaS and PaaS services the following are use cases that can be supported partners customers building applications in Java cloud services that integrate with FA web services partners customers building applications in Java cloud services that have a user interface which get embedded in FA impact due to test and production instances migration between test and production instances federation of user with on premise and federation of actual user with on premise for some users with cloud identity store for other users.

Some key attributes of the multi tenant shared architecture can include each tenant gets a completely isolated schema each Exadata compute node has multiple database instances each instance has multiple schemas e.g. tenants each schema tenant is a container that can manage database objects including tables views stored procedures triggers each schema has one dedicated tablespace and each tablespace has one data file.

In current database implementations only one customer can reside within each database instance. Therefore multiple customers require multiple database instances. Alternatively according to the embodiments of the present invention the database instance can be shared among multiple customers since multiple schemas are included in one database instance. Each schema can represent a tenant therefore one database instance can have multiple tenants.

For example Fusion applications and Java service are single tenant services. Single tenant services are assigned to one customer. The database service is a multi tenant service. The POD for a database service is an Exadata rack with a couple of database instances on the rack. In this case many customers can use one POD. Therefore a database service is a multi tenant service because a POD can have multiple customers This allows for a one time setup of a POD and then the runtime provisioning by SDI module to add multiple tenants to the POD at runtime.

At a customer requests a database service from cloud UI for a trial service. Alternatively a customer can request a database service from the store UI for a paid service. At cloud UI sends the customer request to TAS module . At TAS module can initiate provisioning by calling SDI module via BPEL. In some instances TAS module can initiate provisioning only when services are available. At SDI module can call PLSQL APIs in the CLOUD UI to associate a schema for the requesting customer. At after successful association SDI module can notify TAS module and TAS module can notify e.g. email customer. Subsequently the customer logs into webserver and activates the database service.

According to another embodiment a service provisioning for a Fusion application can be implemented. For example a new Fusion application subscription order is received by SDI module . Upon approval of the order a Fusion application POD is provisioned. The customer e.g. tenant provides key information to enable the tenant to be setup in that pod. Upon creation of the initial user the Fusion applications cloud service emails the user ID and password to the initial user. Furthermore the tenant provisioning to an allocation pod is a subset of the standard setup process an on premise customer would follow.
