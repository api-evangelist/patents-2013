Various network pages exist that provide users with information about products or services that may be used by a respective user in determining to purchase a product or service. Discovering relationships among these products or services remains problematic and leads to users not being able to effectively discover new products or content.

The present disclosure relates to forming relationships among items to enhance user experiences in navigating a content database. Various sites accessible over a network provide users with information about products or services and this information may be used by a respective user in determining to purchase a product or service. For example a site may provide a user with information about movies thereby assisting the user in determining whether to watch or purchase particular ones of the movies. Discovering classifications of these movies remains problematic and impairs user discovery of new movies or content.

As a non limiting example a user may navigate to a movie description page containing information about a movie. The movie description page may contain various keywords associated with the movie that are related to the genre of the movie the plot the actors etc. For example a movie description page for a movie entitled The Magician may have the keywords magic or fantasy. Yet keywords provided by administrators or other users may be unreliable and may not be descriptive of the movie.

Accordingly a system where users are able to provide keywords for items may be beneficial where the keywords are scrutinized to determine the reliability of the keywords in describing particular items. When navigating a database of the items the user may be able to view his or her provided keywords hence customizing the experience for the user. Additionally when a keyword provided by one or more users for a particular item meets a threshold indicating a reliability of the keyword the keyword may be surfaced as a community keyword and may be viewed by other users. The community keywords may be helpful in navigating a site and may lead to the discovery of additional items or content. In the following discussion a general description of the system and its components is provided followed by a discussion of the operation of the same.

With reference to shown is a pictorial diagram of a portion of an example user interface that may be rendered by a client according to various embodiments. As discussed above network pages may provide information about an item. In the non limiting example of an item may comprise a movie wherein the user interface is encoded to provide movie information to one or more users.

Users may be permitted the ability to generate labels tags or keywords to be associated with particular items as depicted by a user keyword portion of the user interface. For example a user may provide a label seen it indicating that the user has viewed the movie. The user keyword portion may be shown only to the user who has submitted the labels or keywords providing the user with a custom site experience. Yet as various users provide labels or keywords particular ones of the keywords may be weighted to determine community keywords. Community keywords may comprise for example a uniform set of keywords that may be used in association with an item and will not vary from user to user. Community keywords may be shown in for example an item keyword portion of the user interface. Associating keywords with particular items and determining which keywords to surface as community keywords will be described in greater detail below.

Turning now to shown is a networked environment according to various embodiments. The networked environment includes a computing environment a client device and external resources which are in data communication with each other via a network . The network includes for example the Internet intranets extranets wide area networks WANs local area networks LANs wired networks wireless networks or other suitable networks etc. or any combination of two or more such networks. For example such networks may comprise satellite networks cable networks Ethernet networks and other types of networks.

The computing environment may comprise for example a server computer or any other system providing computing capability. Alternatively the computing environment may employ a plurality of computing devices that may be arranged for example in one or more server banks or computer banks or other arrangements. Such computing devices may be located in a single installation or may be distributed among many different geographical locations. For example the computing environment may include a plurality of computing devices that together may comprise a hosted computing resource a grid computing resource and or any other distributed computing arrangement. In some cases the computing environment may correspond to an elastic computing resource where the allotted capacity of processing network storage or other computing related resources may vary over time.

Various applications and or other functionality may be executed in the computing environment according to various embodiments. Also various data is stored in a data store that is accessible to the computing environment . The data store may be representative of a plurality of data stores as can be appreciated. The data stored in the data store for example is associated with the operation of the various applications and or functional entities described below.

The components executed on the computing environment for example include an item database application a keyword management application and other applications services processes systems engines or functionality not discussed in detail herein.

The item database application is executed in order to facilitate the presentation of data associated with items over the network . For example the item database application may comprise a database of movies having information associated with movies such as a synopsis cast crew filming location etc. The item database application performs various backend functions to facilitate the presentation of item data as will be described. For example the item database application generates network pages such as web pages mobile application data or other types of network content that are sent to client devices for the purposes of providing items for consumption by users of the item database application . In addition the item database application may generate network pages and or render media content for the purchase rental download or lease of an item. According to various embodiments an item database application may comprise an electronic commerce system.

The keyword management application is executed in order to form user keyword and item keyword associations based on requests submitted by users of the item database application . For example a user of the item database application may initiate a request to associate a keyword with a particular item. The keyword management application may associate the keyword with the particular item as well as associate the keyword with the requesting user. In addition the keyword management application may determine whether a keyword for a particular item is reliably descriptive of the item so as to warrant the keyword to be surfaced as a community keyword as will be described in greater detail below.

The data stored in the data store includes for example data residing in an item database user data predefined thresholds item keyword associations user keyword associations keywords community keywords and potentially other data. The data residing in an item database may contain information associated with a plurality of items . Each item may have item data corresponding to the particular item . Item data may comprise for example a title an item description a genre and or various information associated with an item . The user data may comprise information associated with a user of a network site and or a social networking site such as gender age address location phone number Internet Protocol IP address e mail address various user preferences external social networking accounts and or any other information associated with the user. The user data may be used in determining keywords to be presented to the corresponding user as will be discussed in greater detail below.

Predefined thresholds may comprise for example configurable thresholds that are used in the determination of whether a keyword used in forming an item keyword association is reliably descriptive of a particular item . If an item keyword association is reliably descriptive determined using the predefined threshold the keyword may be surfaced as a community keyword as will be discussed in greater detail below. According to one embodiment a predefined threshold may comprise a numeric integer. When a number of the same or similar item keyword associations has been reached it may be determined that the item keyword association is reliably descriptive.

According to another embodiment a predefined threshold may comprise for example predefined heuristics. For example a predefined heuristic may employ the use of a whitelist a blacklist or a combination thereof in the determination of whether to surface a keyword as a community keyword . A predefined list of permissible keywords i.e. a whitelist may be used to determine a weight of a keyword increasing the likelihood of the keyword being surfaced as a community keyword . Similarly a predefined list of non permissible keywords i.e. a blacklist may be used to determine a weight of a keyword decreasing the likelihood of the keyword being surfaced as a community keyword .

According to yet another embodiment a predefined heuristic may employ the use of an age of the keyword in the determination whether to surface a keyword as a community keyword . For example as a keyword becomes less relevant e.g. due to a change in common speech habits in describing an item or a movie a keyword may be afforded less weight. Thus the weight of a keyword may decay over time. However additional requests to associate a particular item with the keyword may increase the relevancy and reliability of the keyword over time.

Item keyword associations may comprise for example an association between a particular item stored in memory with a particular keyword . Similarly user keyword associations may comprise for example an association between a particular user of the item database application with a particular keyword . Keywords may comprise for example a word set of words phrase category etc. provided by one or more users or administrators that may be used to describe an item . Community keywords may comprise for example a subset of keywords that are reliably descriptive of particular items .

The client device is representative of one or more client devices that may be coupled to the network . The client device may comprise for example a processor based system such as a computer system. Such a computer system may be embodied in the form of a desktop computer a laptop computer personal digital assistants cellular telephones smartphones set top boxes music players web pads tablet computer systems game consoles electronic book readers or other devices with like capability. The client device may include a display . The display may comprise for example one or more devices such as liquid crystal display LCD displays gas plasma based flat panel displays organic light emitting diode OLED displays electrophoretic ink E ink displays LCD projectors or other types of display devices etc.

The client device may be configured to execute various applications such as a client application and or other applications. The client application may be executed in a client device for example to access network content served up by the computing environment and or other servers thereby rendering a user interface on the display . To this end the client application may comprise for example a browser a dedicated application etc. and the user interface may comprise a network page an application screen etc. The client device may be configured to execute applications beyond the client application such as for example email applications social networking applications word processors spreadsheets and or other applications.

The external resources are representative of a plurality of external computing devices services network sites and or application programming interfaces APIs used by the keyword management application . For example the keyword management application may communicate with a plurality of social networks in order to determine demographics preferences and or any information associated with one or more users through an API or similar method. Additionally the item database application may be used to facilitate sharing of lists generated by the keyword management application among various network sites or social networks as will be discussed in greater detail below.

Next a general description of the operation of the various components of the networked environment is provided. To begin as a non limiting example a user may initiate a request to associate a keyword with a particular item. The keyword management application may identify the keyword in the request received from for example the client device or any other service or device. Subsequently the keyword identified in the request may be associated with the user providing the keyword in the request to form a user keyword association . As a non limiting example the user keyword association may be stored in a data store or like memory.

The keyword management application may associate the keyword set forth in the request with one or more items to form one or more item keyword associations . As a non limiting example the item keyword association may be stored in a data store or like memory. As may be appreciated numerous users may provide a variety of keywords for a plurality of items . It may be beneficial to further scrutinize the submitted keywords to determine which keywords may be beneficial in categorizing items thus facilitating the determination of which keywords may be surfaced as community keywords .

Thus the keyword management application may determine whether the item keyword association has met or exceeded a predefined threshold indicating a reliability of the keyword in correctly describing the particular item . For example numerous users may have submitted the keyword magic in association with a movie titled The Magician. When a number of requests comprising the item keyword association of magic with The Magician have exceeded a predefined threshold it may be understood that the item keyword association is reliable for describing the movie The Magician. Accordingly the keyword may be surfaced to the community as will be described in greater detail below.

If the item keyword association has met the predefined threshold the keyword may be surfaced. According to one embodiment surfacing may comprise for example encoding the keyword in an item description page as a community keyword as will be described in greater detail below. Encoding the keyword in the item description page may further comprise for example encoding the keyword as a hyperlink wherein a manipulation of the hyperlink by a user of the item description page may initiate one or more subsequent user interfaces comprising a plurality of items associated with the manipulated hyperlink.

The keyword management application may generate and or update one or more lists comprising one or more items for the keyword identified in the request. According to one embodiment the list may comprise item keyword associations . For example a list for the keyword magic may be generated and encoded in a user interface wherein the list comprises a plurality of movies associated with the magic keyword . The list may comprise items associated with a respective keyword and or items associated with keywords similar to the respective keyword .

Alternatively the list may comprise user keyword associations . For example a list showing all keywords associated by a user with each of the keyword s respective items may be generated and encoded in a user interface wherein the list comprises a plurality of movies associated with keyword s provided by the user.

Additionally the keyword management application may reward an initial user if an item keyword association pioneered by the initial user has met the predefined threshold thus leading to the keyword being surfaced as a community keyword . An initial user may comprise for example the first user to initiate a request to associate the particular item with the particular keyword to form the item keyword association . Similarly the keyword management application may reward more than one user by rewarding for example a predefined number N of users who initiated at least one of a plurality of first received requests to associate the keyword with the item. The predefined number N may comprise for example a percentage or a number of a portion of the first users to associate a keyword that later became surfaced as a community keyword corresponding to an item . A reward may comprise for example providing the user with access to particular content affording the user more weight in future requests encoding an icon e.g. a badge next to the user s name in various user interfaces etc. The reward may provide users of the system with an incentive to continue generating reliable item keyword associations .

Referring next to shown is a pictorial diagram of an example user interface rendered by the client device in the networked environment of according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. In the non limiting example of a user interface may comprise an item description page providing users with information about the item such as item data . For example as shown in an item may comprise a movie and item data may comprise information about the movie such as for example the synopsis cast crew filming locations reviews rating etc. A watch list component may be encoded in the user interface such that when manipulated the movie corresponding to the respective item description page may be added to a list. Similarly a watch trailer component may be encoded in the user interface such that when manipulated a series of subsequent user interfaces may be rendered to play a movie trailer corresponding to the movie.

Also depicted in are a plurality of tags or keywords that may be descriptive of the movie corresponding to the item description page. For example the movie The Magician depicted in may be associated with the keywords magician wizard circus England illusion etc. The keywords may be encoded in the user interface as hyperlinks. Accordingly when manipulated by a user a hyperlink may initiate the rendering of a series of additional user interfaces corresponding to the manipulated hyperlink. For example upon a manipulation of the magician hyperlink an additional user interface may be rendered comprising a plurality of items also associated with the magician keyword as will be described in detail with respect to . Similarly one or more genres may be associated with the item and may be encoded in the user interface as hyperlinks as described above.

Turning now to shown is a pictorial diagram of an example user interface rendered by the client device in the networked environment of according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. In the non limiting example of an add keyword component may be encoded in the user interface . Upon a manipulation of the add keyword component a request to associate a keyword with the item depicted in the item description page may be created. For example a user may manipulate the add keyword component to submit a request to the keyword management application to associate the Seen It keyword to the item . The keyword management application may associate the keyword with the item to form an item keyword association as well as to associate the keyword with the user to form a user keyword association .

The user keyword association may be used for example to encode the keywords associated with the item by the user in a user portion of the user interface . As may be appreciated this portion of the user interface may vary from user to user. Additionally the item keyword association may be used for example to encode community keywords in a community portion of the user interface . As may be appreciated this portion of the user interface may be uniform throughout the community and will not vary from user to user. Thus a user interface comprising the community keywords may be generated irrespective of the user requesting the user interface . However according to various embodiments the community keywords may be scored to determine community keywords most relevant for a respective user. Based on the score it may be determined which community keywords to encode in the user interface for the respective user. For example it may be determined that the keyword magic may be of a higher interest for a particular user than the keyword action. Thus the keyword magic may be afforded a score making it more likely the keyword will be surfaced to the particular user.

Moving on to shown is a pictorial diagram of an example user interface rendered by the client device in the networked environment of according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. In the non limiting example of shown is a list of a plurality of items wherein each of the items corresponds to a respective keyword . The list for example comprises a plurality of movies each of the movies corresponding to the magic keyword . As may be appreciated by viewing the user interface a user may be able to find other content based on similarities with other movies based on item keyword associations crowd sourced among a plurality of users.

The list may be sorted refined or otherwise filtered. For example a user may manipulate an add keyword component to locate items associated with more than one keyword . Similarly a user may refine the list of items according to title via a title refinement component or the user may refine the list of items according to a genre via a genre refinement component .

Turning now to shown is a pictorial diagram of an example user interface rendered by the client device in the networked environment of according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. In the non limiting example of shown is a list of a plurality of items wherein each of the items corresponds to a respective keyword given by a respective user e.g. User 1 . The list of items comprises for example a plurality of movies. The keywords associated with each of the movies may be shown in association with the movie. An add keyword component may facilitate creating new item keyword associations .

As may be appreciated a user may be able to customize user generated item keyword associations via the user interface . For example the user may be able to add the Seen It keyword for movies the user has watched. Similarly the user may be able to add the Haven t Seen keyword for movies the user has yet to watch. By engaging one of the keywords encoded in the form of a hyperlink button checkbox or other user interface component the user may inspect additional user interfaces having lists of items associated with that keyword . For example by manipulating a component corresponding to the Seen It keyword a user may be taken to a user interface comprising a list of movies the user has yet to watch. A share component may initiate the sharing of the respective user interface for example via one or more social networks .

Referring next to shown is a flowchart that provides one example of the operation of a portion of the keyword management application according to various embodiments. It is understood that the flowchart of provides merely an example of the many different types of functional arrangements that may be employed to implement the operation of the portion of the keyword management application as described herein. As an alternative the flowchart of may be viewed as depicting an example of elements of a method implemented in the computing environment according to one or more embodiments.

Beginning with a keyword is identified in a request. As a non limiting example a user may initiate a request to associate a keyword with a particular item . As discussed above with respect to a user may manipulate a component e.g. an add keyword component in a user interface that initiates a request to associate a keyword with an item depicted in the user interface . A keyword may be a descriptive word or a combination of words that may be provided by the user describing the item .

Next in the keyword identified in the request may be associated with the user providing the keyword in the request to form a user keyword association . As a non limiting example the user keyword association may be stored in a data store or like memory.

In the keyword identified in the request may be associated with one or more items corresponding to the request to form an item keyword association . As a non limiting example the item keyword association may be stored in a data store or like memory. As may be appreciated numerous users may provide a variety of keywords for a plurality of items . It may be beneficial to further scrutinize the submitted keywords to determine which keywords may be beneficial in categorizing items thus facilitating the determination of which keywords may be surfaced as community keywords .

Thus in a weight may be assigned to the keyword wherein the weight indicates a reliability of the keyword in correctly describing the particular item . A weight for a respective keyword may be determined for example based at least in part on the number of requests created by users to form the association between the item and the keyword . Additionally the weight may be based at least in part on a user initiating the request wherein users with a measured accuracy of keyword submissions may be afforded more or less credibility in determining a weight.

According to various embodiments the weight may be adjusted according to the age of the keyword . For example as a keyword becomes less relevant e.g. due to a change in common speech habits in describing an item or a movie a keyword may be afforded less weight. Thus the weight of a keyword may decay over time while additional submissions of the keyword may increase the weight such that the keyword maintains relevancy.

In addition a whitelist a blacklist or a combination thereof may be used in the determination of a weight for a keyword . For example a predefined list of permissible keywords i.e. a whitelist may be used to determine a weight of a keyword increasing the likelihood of the keyword being surfaced as a community keyword . Similarly a predefined list of non permissible keywords i.e. a blacklist may be used to determine a weight of a keyword decreasing the likelihood of the keyword being surfaced as a community keyword .

According to various embodiments users may have the ability to rate keywords . For example a keyword may be encoded in a user interface corresponding to a rating feature that when manipulated permits a user to provide whether the user found the keyword descriptive of the item . As a non limiting example an up arrow and a down arrow may be employed as the rating feature wherein manipulating the up arrow indicates the user found the keyword helpful in describing the item and the down arrow indicates the user found the keyword not helpful in describing the item .

In it is determined whether the weight of a keyword has met or exceeded a predefined threshold indicating a reliability of the keyword in correctly describing the particular item . For example numerous users may have submitted the keyword magic in association with a movie titled The Magician. When a number of requests comprising the item keyword association of magic with The Magician have exceeded a predefined threshold it may be understood that the item keyword association is reliable for describing the movie The Magician. Accordingly the keyword may be surfaced to the community as will be described in greater detail below.

If the item keyword association has not met the predefined threshold the keyword may be excluded in and the analysis of the item keyword association ends although the item keyword association may be maintained in a data store or like memory to be examined at a later time e.g. when another user initiates a request comprising the same item keyword association . Excluding the keyword may comprise for example prohibiting the keyword from being encoded in a user interface corresponding to the item subject to the item keyword association .

Alternatively if the item keyword association has met the predefined threshold in the keyword may be surfaced. According to one embodiment surfacing may comprise for example encoding the keyword in an item description page as a community keyword as depicted above with respect to . Encoding the keyword in the item description page may further comprise for example encoding the keyword as a hyperlink wherein a manipulation of the hyperlink by a user of the item description page may initiate one or more subsequent user interfaces comprising a plurality of items associated with the manipulated hyperlink. For example provides an example user interface that may be rendered upon a manipulation of a hyperlink corresponding to the magic community keyword . As depicted in a list comprising a plurality of items associated with the particular keyword may be shown allowing the user the ability to discover additional content. Generation of the list will be described below with respect to .

Referring back to in one or more lists comprising one or more items may be generated or updated for the keyword identified in the request. According to one embodiment the list may comprise item keyword associations . For example as shown in a list for the keyword magic may be generated and encoded in a user interface wherein the list comprises a plurality of movies associated with the magic keyword. The list may comprise items associated with a respective keyword and or items associated with keywords similar to the respective keyword .

According to another embodiment the list may comprise user keyword associations . For example as shown in a list showing all keywords associated by a user with each of the keyword s respective items may be generated and encoded in a user interface wherein the list comprises a plurality of movies associated with keyword s provided by the user.

Referring back to in the keyword management application may generate one or recommendations for one or more users based at least in part on keywords manipulated and or submitted by the one or more users. A recommendation may comprise for example users with interests related to the manipulated or submitted keywords lists similar to the manipulated or submitted keywords etc. As may be appreciated the recommendation may assist a user in discovering additional content.

In the keyword management application may generate a reward for an initial user when the item keyword association has met the predefined threshold thereby leading to the keyword being surfaced as a community keyword . An initial user may comprise for example the first user to initiate a request to associate the particular item with the particular keyword to form the item keyword association . A reward may comprise for example providing the user with access to particular content affording the user more weight in future requests encoding an icon e.g. a badge next to the user s name in various user interfaces etc. The reward may provide users of the system with an incentive to continue generating reliable item keyword associations .
