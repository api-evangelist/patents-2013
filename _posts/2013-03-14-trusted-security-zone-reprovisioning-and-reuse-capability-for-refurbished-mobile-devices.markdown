Electronic communications may carry a wide variety of content for example media files electronic mail medical records financial transactions and other confidential information. The electronic communications may travel for some of the communication end to end path over unsecured communication links where the content may be subject to tampering or intrusion. A variety of security measures have been applied to provide increased security and to raise the level of difficulty for nefarious actors attempting to access the confidential information.

In an embodiment a method for creating a user specific trusted security zone key on a mobile device is disclosed. The method comprises receiving user input information hashing the user input information with a trusted security zone master key to generate a user specific trusted security zone key communicating the user input information to a trusted service manager verifying the user specific trusted security zone key between the mobile device and the trusted service manager and using the user specific trusted security zone key to operate one or more secure applications on the mobile device.

In an embodiment a method for creating a user specific trusted security zone key during the initial set up of a mobile device is disclosed. The method comprises receiving a user input information to a mobile device comprising a trusted security zone hashing the user input information with the trusted security zone master key to generate a user specific trusted security zone key wherein the hashing process is completed by a set up application on the mobile device communicating the user input information to a trusted service manager wherein the trusted service manager has access to the trusted security zone master key and the trusted service manager completes a similar hashing process to generate the user specific trusted security zone key verifying the user specific trusted security zone key between the mobile device and the trusted service manager wherein the device and TSM communicate via a service provider network and using the user specific trusted security zone key to operate one or more secure applications executed in trust zone on the mobile device.

In an embodiment a method for creating a user specific trusted security zone key for use on a mobile device is disclosed. The method comprises receiving a user input information via a mobile device in communication with a network server wherein the mobile device comprises a trusted security zone generating a first user specific trusted security zone key by hashing the user input information with a trusted security zone master key wherein the hashing process is completed by an application on the network server and using the first user specific trusted security zone key to operate secure applications executed in the trusted security zone of the mobile device.

These and other features will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.

It should be understood at the outset that although illustrative implementations of one or more embodiments are illustrated below the disclosed systems and methods may be implemented using any number of techniques whether currently known or not yet in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations drawings and techniques illustrated below but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.

Embodiments of the disclosure are directed to methods and systems for generating and using user specific keys to access a trusted security zone of a mobile device. Accessing the trusted security zone may comprise one or more of the following operating one or more secure applications on the mobile device reading data from the trusted security zone writing data to the trusted security zone and accessing one or more keys in the trusted security zone. The user specific keys may be used in place of a trusted security zone master key and may be generated based on the trusted security zone master key. The trusted security zone master key and the user specific keys may be stored in or provisioned to the trusted security zone. A trusted security zone key may be used to verify the identity of a user and or mobile device when executing in the trusted security zone. It may be tied to a particular user and may be known by a trusted service manager in communication with the mobile device.

Throughout the lifespan of a mobile device it may be refurbished or reused and may be passed from one user to the next. For example a first user may wish to change devices such as for an upgrade and may surrender the first device back to the provider of the device. The provider may then refurbish the device so that it may be resold or reissued to a second user. The refurbish process may include returning the device to factory settings. In the case where the mobile device comprises a trusted security zone a second user may not be able to access the trusted security zone or applications executed in the trusted security zone because it would have already been personalized by the first user. The personalization process may include associating the trusted security zone master key with the first user of the device. Therefore it may be desired to alter the personalization process of the trusted security zone such that multiple users may be able to access and execute in the trusted security zone of a mobile device.

This may be accomplished by generating multiple user specific trusted security zone keys which may be used in place of the trusted security zone master key. For example the trusted security zone master key may be hashed with user specific information or user input information to generate a new user specific trusted security zone key. The hashing may be completed using a one way secure cryptographic hash function for instance one of MD5 SHA 0 SHA 1 SHA 2 SHA 3 or other well known one way secure cryptographic hash functions. Herein after a one way secure cryptographic hash function may be referred to more concisely as a hash function or a hashing function. The use of a one way secure hash function may prevent the determination of the trusted security zone master key and or the user specific key by outside entities. The user specific key may not be determined from the master key by a deterministic algorithm because of the hashing operation that employs not only the master key but also some information contributed by the user or specific to the user. Likewise the master key may not be determined from a user specific key by a deterministic algorithm. Additionally a first user specific key generated based on the master key may not be determined from a second user specific key generated from the same master key by a deterministic algorithm.

The user specific keys may be generated by an application on the mobile device or an application on a network server in communication with the mobile device. The user specific key may be associated with a user of the mobile device and may be used to verify the identity of the user and or mobile device when executing secure applications in the trusted security zone. Then if the device is returned to factory settings the personalization process may be repeated and a second user specific trusted security zone key may be generated and used by a second user of the mobile device.

A trusted security zone provides chipsets with a hardware root of trust a secure execution environment for applications and secure access to peripherals. A hardware root of trust means the chipset should only execute programs intended by the device manufacturer or vendor and resists software and physical attacks and therefore remains trusted to provide the intended level of security. The chipset architecture is designed to promote a programmable environment that allows the confidentiality and integrity of assets to be protected from specific attacks. Trusted security zone capabilities are becoming features in both wireless and fixed hardware architecture designs. Providing the trusted security zone in the main mobile device chipset and protecting the hardware root of trust removes the need for separate secure hardware to authenticate the device or user. To ensure the integrity of the applications requiring trusted data such as a mobile financial services application the trusted security zone also provides the secure execution environment where only trusted applications can operate safe from attacks. Security is further promoted by restricting access of non trusted applications to peripherals such as data inputs and data outputs while a trusted application is running in the secure execution environment. In an embodiment the trusted security zone may be conceptualized as hardware assisted security.

A complete trusted execution environment TEE may be implemented through the use of the trusted security zone hardware and software architecture. The trusted execution environment is an execution environment that is parallel to the execution environment of the main mobile device operating system. The trusted execution environment and or the trusted security zone may provide a base layer of functionality and or utilities for use of applications that may execute in the trusted security zone. For example in an embodiment trust tokens may be generated by the base layer of functionality and or utilities of the trusted execution environment and or trusted security zone for use in trusted end to end communication links to document a continuity of trust of the communications. Through standardization of application programming interfaces APIs the trusted execution environment becomes a place to which scalable deployment of secure services can be targeted. A device which has a chipset that has a trusted execution environment on it may exist in a trusted services environment where devices in the trusted services environment are trusted and protected against attacks. The trusted execution environment can be implemented on mobile phones and tablets as well as extending to other trusted devices such as personal computers servers sensors medical devices point of sale terminals industrial automation handheld terminals automotive etc.

The trusted security zone is implemented by partitioning all of the hardware and software resources of the mobile device into two partitions a secure partition and a normal partition. The secure partition may be implemented by a first physical processor and the normal partition may be implemented by a second physical processor. Alternatively the secure partition may be implemented by a first virtual processor and the normal partition may be implemented by a second virtual processor. Placing sensitive resources in the secure partition can protect against possible attacks on those resources. For example resources such as trusted software applications may run in the secure partition and have access to hardware peripherals such as a touchscreen or a secure location in memory. Less secure peripherals such as wireless radios may be disabled completely while the secure partition is being accessed while other peripherals may only be accessed from the secure partition. While the secure partition is being accessed through the trusted execution environment the main mobile operating system in the normal partition is suspended and applications in the normal partition are prevented from accessing the secure peripherals and data. This prevents corrupted applications or malware applications from breaking the trust of the device.

The trusted security zone is implemented by partitioning the hardware and software resources to exist in a secure subsystem which is not accessible to components outside the secure subsystem. The trusted security zone is built into the processor architecture at the time of manufacture through hardware logic present in the trusted security zone which enables a perimeter boundary between the secure partition and the normal partition. The trusted security zone may only be manipulated by those with the proper credential and in an embodiment may not be added to the chip after it is manufactured. Software architecture to support the secure partition may be provided through a dedicated secure kernel running trusted applications. Trusted applications are independent secure applications which can be accessed by normal applications through an application programming interface in the trusted execution environment on a chipset that utilizes the trusted security zone.

In an embodiment the normal partition applications run on a first virtual processor and the secure partition applications run on a second virtual processor. Both virtual processors may run on a single physical processor executing in a time sliced fashion removing the need for a dedicated physical security processor. Time sliced execution comprises switching contexts between the two virtual processors to share processor resources based on tightly controlled mechanisms such as secure software instructions or hardware exceptions. The context of the currently running virtual processor is saved the context of the virtual processor being switched to is restored and processing is restarted in the restored virtual processor. Time sliced execution protects the trusted security zone by stopping the execution of the normal partition while the secure partition is executing.

The two virtual processors context switch via a processor mode called monitor mode when changing the currently running virtual processor. The mechanisms by which the processor can enter monitor mode from the normal partition are tightly controlled. The entry to monitor mode can be triggered by software executing a dedicated instruction the Secure Monitor Call SMC instruction or by a subset of the hardware exception mechanisms such as hardware interrupts which can be configured to cause the processor to switch into monitor mode. The software that executes within monitor mode then saves the context of the running virtual processor and switches to the secure virtual processor.

The trusted security zone runs a separate operating system that is not accessible to the device users. For security purposes the trusted security zone is not open to users for installing applications which means users do not have access to install applications in the trusted security zone. This prevents corrupted applications or malware applications from executing powerful instructions reserved to the trusted security zone and thus preserves the trust of the device. The security of the system is achieved at least in part by partitioning the hardware and software resources of the mobile phone so they exist in one of two partitions the secure partition for the security subsystem and the normal partition for everything else. Placing the trusted security zone in the secure partition and restricting access from the normal partition protects against software and basic hardware attacks. Hardware logic ensures that no secure partition resources can be accessed by the normal partition components or applications. A dedicated secure partition operating system runs in a virtual processor separate from the normal partition operating system that likewise executes in its own virtual processor. Users may install applications on the mobile device which may execute in the normal partition operating system described above. The trusted security zone runs a separate operating system for the secure partition that is installed by the mobile device manufacturer or vendor and users are not able to install new applications in or alter the contents of the trusted security zone.

Turning now to a communication system is described. In an embodiment the communication system comprises a mobile device comprising a trusted security zone a permissive sector a cellular radio transceiver and an optional user interface . In an embodiment the trusted security zone comprises one or more secure applications . The permissive sector may comprise one or more device applications . The mobile device may engage in a variety of communication exchanges. The mobile device may comprise a variety of devices such as a mobile phone a personal digital assistant PDA a media player a laptop computer a tablet computer and other electronic devices having a macro cellular radio transceiver.

As described above the trusted security zone may be provided by a physically separate processor or by a virtual processor. The one or more secure applications may be any of a variety of applications that process and or transmit confidential information. The confidential information may comprise sensitive business documents such as electronic mail marketing literature business plans client lists addresses employee data intellectual property documents and the like. The confidential information may comprise personal medical records or medical data that are subject to privacy requirements enforced by government regulatory bodies or commercial standards. The confidential information may comprise financial information such as account numbers authentication identities account balance information and the like.

When processing and or transmitting the confidential information the secure application executes at least partially in the trusted security zone . It is a characteristic or feature of the trusted security zone as described more fully above that when a secure application executes in the trusted security zone untrusted applications are prevented from executing and or accessing trusted memory partitions and or accessing the display communication interfaces or input devices of the mobile device thereby reducing the opportunity for malware that may have infiltrated the mobile device to corrupt or to monitor the confidential information.

In an embodiment the system comprises a network . The network may be a private network a public network or a combination thereof. The network may promote voice communications and data communications. Portions of the network may provide an IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS network. The mobile device may couple to the network by a variety of communication paths. The mobile device may communicate with a base transceiver station BTS via a wireless link according to any of a variety of wireless communications protocols including but not limited to code division multiple access CDMA long term evolution LTE worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX global system for mobile communications GSM or other wireless communication protocol. The wireless link between the mobile device and the base transceiver station may couple the mobile device to the network .

In an embodiment the trusted security zone may be provided in a secure area of a processor and or memory chip shared with the permissive sector or in a separate processor and or memory chip. The trusted security zone may be provided as what may be conceptualized as invisible space. In an embodiment at least some of the memory addresses occupied by the trusted security zone may be inaccessible to device applications executing out of permissive sector . This demarcation of accessible memory addresses versus inaccessible memory addresses may be provided by the operating system of the mobile device . In an embodiment the trusted security zone may encapsulate a trusted execution environment TEE for example conforming at least partially to the Global Platform 2.0 or later revision trusted execution environment standard. It is understood however that the trusted security zone is contemplated to provide further functionality than that envisioned by the trusted execution environment standards.

In an embodiment a trust exchange service is provided in the trusted security zone . The trust exchange service may be conceptualized as bridging between the permissive sector and the trusted security zone . The trust exchange service promotes secure interactions between the applications executing in the permissive sector and applications executing in the trusted security zone . The security may be provided using one or more techniques. For example the trust exchange service may pause a plurality of execution threads when initiating an interaction with the trusted security zone for example while handling a request for service from the centralized media controller application . This feature may reduce the opportunity that other threads may sniff or otherwise seek to intrude on the operation. For example the trust exchange service may impose a criteria that all communication between the permissive sector and the trusted security zone be conducted using data that is transformed according to protocols of the trusted security zone for example using encryption and or using hashing. The trust exchange service may also hide address space in the trusted security zone and or make the address space inaccessible to the permissive sector without the mediation of the trust exchange service .

The device applications executed in the permissive sector may be any of a variety of applications. One of the device applications may be a telephone application that receives dialed digits and attempts to originate a voice call for example a voice over IP VoIP call to a called telephone. One of the device applications may be a web browser application that requests content from the network for example by sending out a hypertext transport protocol HTTP message embedding a universal reference locator URL . One of the device applications may be a media player that requests streaming media from the network . Many of the device applications may depend upon communication service provided by an IMS network to deliver their functionality to an end user of the mobile device . One of the device applications may comprise a mobile transaction interface where a user may complete a purchase using the application and secure information such as credit card and or bank information may be communicated through the application.

The user interface of the mobile device may in some embodiments comprise a display an input system a speaker system and or a microphone. In some embodiments the display may comprise a screen and the input system may comprise a keypad and or a touch screen for example. The speaker system may communicate audio such as media messages or phone call audio to a user of the mobile device . The microphone may receive voice and or audio from a user and or communicate audio to a user. In an embodiment a user may utilize the user interface to communicate with the mobile device for example to initiate the execution of a device application and or a secure application . Additionally a user may receive communication from the mobile device via the user interface such as messages emails contact information caller identification call history internet access etc. A user may additionally employ the user interface for viewing and or listening to media such as music movies shows videos photos games etc.

In an embodiment the trusted security zone may comprise a trusted security zone master key wherein the master key may serve to verify the identity of the mobile device or user of the mobile device when executing secure applications . For example when a secure application is first executed by a mobile device the master key may be verified by a trusted service manager TSM before any confidential information is shared or communicated to the secure application . In a personalization process the master key may be associated with or assigned to a user of the mobile device . The master key may comprise a set of numbers letters and or symbols unique to the mobile device . Additionally the master key may be known by the trusted service manager wherein the master key may be communicated to the trusted service manager before the mobile device is issued to a user and or put into service for example. In an embodiment the master key may be burned to or embedded in the memory of the mobile device during the manufacturing process of the mobile device . In an embodiment the master key may be considered unchanged or unalterable after it has been place on a mobile device .

In some embodiments it may be desired to keep the trusted security zone master key unknown or protected. For example if the mobile device is transferred from a first user to a second user by sale or gift or exchange through the provider the second user may not be able to access the trusted security zone of the mobile device because the master key would have already been associated with the first user during the personalization process. In some embodiments a user specific key may be generated based on the trusted security zone master key as well as personalized user information wherein the user specific key may be used instead of the master key to verify the identity of the user of the mobile device . The user specific key may in some embodiments be generated during a set up or provisioning procedure of the mobile device .

As an example a first user may purchase the mobile device from a service provider and during the set up of the device a first user specific key may be generated and associated with the first user as described above. The first user may employ the first user specific key when downloading and or operating secure applications on the mobile device . Then the first user may wish to upgrade to another mobile device and may surrender or trade in the first mobile device to the service provider. The service provider may clear the device including the trusted security zone and return the device to factory settings wherein the first user specific key may or may not be kept after the return to factory settings. Then the device may be purchased by or issued to a second user wherein the set up procedure of the device may be repeated and a second user specific key may be generated and associated with the second user. The second user may employ the second user specific key when downloading and or operating secure applications on the mobile device . The process may be repeated as many times as necessary.

In an embodiment a set up application may be operable to generate one or more user specific keys . In one embodiment the set up application may be a secure application executed in the trusted security zone of the mobile device while in another embodiment the set up application may be executed by a network server in communication with the mobile device . The set up application or may be operable to receive the trusted security zone master key information as well as user input personalized information. The user input information may comprise a number code or pin input by the user wherein the code or pin may comprise one or more number letter and or symbol. In other embodiments the user input information may comprise one of credit card information birthdate of a user and or a user account number issued by the service provider of the mobile device . The user specific key may be generated by hashing the trusted security zone master key and the user input information wherein the hashing may be completed by a set up application or . In an embodiment the user specific key may be generated by hashing or otherwise processing by a nonreversible algorithm the trust master key at least some of the user input information and a seed or nonce supplied by the set up application . The user specific key may then be stored in the trusted security zone of the mobile device and or stored on the network server shown with a dashed outline .

In an embodiment the user specific key may be communicated to the trusted service manager TSM in order to verify the identity of the user of the mobile device . In an embodiment the user specific key may be generated by the mobile device and stored on the mobile device and then communicated to the trusted service manager via the network . In another embodiment the user specific key may be generated by the network server stored on either the network server or the mobile device and then communicated to the trusted service manager wherein communication between the mobile device and the trusted service manager may be facilitated by the network server . The trusted service manager may then facilitate communication between the mobile device and vendors wherein communication with vendors may be executed with a secure application .

In an alternative embodiment the user input information used to generate the user specific key on either the network server or the mobile device may be communicated to the trusted service manager wherein the trusted service manager may be operable to complete the hash algorithm of the trusted security zone master key and the user specific information to generate the user specific key . Then the trusted service manager may verify the user specific key by communicating with either the network server or the mobile device .

In an embodiment the trusted service manager that communicates with the mobile device and or network server during the initial set up or provisioning may be identified wherein identification information may be communicated to and stored on the network server and or the mobile device . Then if the mobile device is returned to factory settings and the set up or personalization procedure is repeated the trusted service manager identification information may be used to ensure communication with the correct trusted service manager . Storing the trusted service manager identification information may be desirable because different trusted service managers may comprise differing methods for access protocols to the execution environment. If for some reason the original trusted service manager ceases operation between the initial set up of the mobile device and the next the network server may use the identification information to reestablish a communication channel by establishing the original protocol completed by proxy.

The DSP or some other form of controller or central processing unit operates to control the various components of the mobile device in accordance with embedded software or firmware stored in memory or stored in memory contained within the DSP itself. In addition to the embedded software or firmware the DSP may execute other applications stored in the memory or made available via information carrier media such as portable data storage media like the removable memory card or via wired or wireless network communications. The application software may comprise a compiled set of machine readable instructions that configure the DSP to provide the desired functionality or the application software may be high level software instructions to be processed by an interpreter or compiler to indirectly configure the DSP .

The DSP may communicate with a wireless network via the analog baseband processing unit . In some embodiments the communication may provide Internet connectivity enabling a user to gain access to content on the Internet and to send and receive e mail or text messages. The input output interface interconnects the DSP and various memories and interfaces. The memory and the removable memory card may provide software and data to configure the operation of the DSP . Among the interfaces may be the USB port and the infrared port . The USB port may enable the mobile device to function as a peripheral device to exchange information with a personal computer or other computer system. The infrared port and other optional ports such as a Bluetooth interface or an IEEE 802.11 compliant wireless interface may enable the mobile device to communicate wirelessly with other nearby handsets and or wireless base stations.

The keypad couples to the DSP via the interface to provide one mechanism for the user to make selections enter information and otherwise provide input to the mobile device . Another input mechanism may be the touch screen LCD which may also display text and or graphics to the user. The touch screen LCD controller couples the DSP to the touch screen LCD . The GPS receiver is coupled to the DSP to decode global positioning system signals thereby enabling the mobile device to determine its position.

It is understood that by programming and or loading executable instructions onto the computer system at least one of the CPU the RAM and the ROM are changed transforming the computer system in part into a particular machine or apparatus having the novel functionality taught by the present disclosure. It is fundamental to the electrical engineering and software engineering arts that functionality that can be implemented by loading executable software into a computer can be converted to a hardware implementation by well known design rules. Decisions between implementing a concept in software versus hardware typically hinge on considerations of stability of the design and numbers of units to be produced rather than any issues involved in translating from the software domain to the hardware domain. Generally a design that is still subject to frequent change may be preferred to be implemented in software because re spinning a hardware implementation is more expensive than re spinning a software design. Generally a design that is stable that will be produced in large volume may be preferred to be implemented in hardware for example in an application specific integrated circuit ASIC because for large production runs the hardware implementation may be less expensive than the software implementation. Often a design may be developed and tested in a software form and later transformed by well known design rules to an equivalent hardware implementation in an application specific integrated circuit that hardwires the instructions of the software. In the same manner as a machine controlled by a new ASIC is a particular machine or apparatus likewise a computer that has been programmed and or loaded with executable instructions may be viewed as a particular machine or apparatus.

The secondary storage is typically comprised of one or more disk drives or tape drives and is used for non volatile storage of data and as an over flow data storage device if RAM is not large enough to hold all working data. Secondary storage may be used to store programs which are loaded into RAM when such programs are selected for execution. The ROM is used to store instructions and perhaps data which are read during program execution. ROM is a non volatile memory device which typically has a small memory capacity relative to the larger memory capacity of secondary storage . The RAM is used to store volatile data and perhaps to store instructions. Access to both ROM and RAM is typically faster than to secondary storage . The secondary storage the RAM and or the ROM may be referred to in some contexts as computer readable storage media and or non transitory computer readable media.

These network connectivity devices may enable the processor to communicate with the Internet or one or more intranets. With such a network connection it is contemplated that the processor might receive information from the network or might output information to the network in the course of performing the above described method steps. Such information which is often represented as a sequence of instructions to be executed using processor may be received from and outputted to the network for example in the form of a computer data signal embodied in a carrier wave.

Such information which may include data or instructions to be executed using processor for example may be received from and outputted to the network for example in the form of a computer data baseband signal or signal embodied in a carrier wave. The baseband signal or signal embedded in the carrier wave or other types of signals currently used or hereafter developed may be generated according to several methods well known to one skilled in the art. The baseband signal and or signal embedded in the carrier wave may be referred to in some contexts as a transitory signal.

The processor executes instructions codes computer programs scripts which it accesses from hard disk floppy disk optical disk these various disk based systems may all be considered secondary storage ROM RAM or the network connectivity devices . While only one processor is shown multiple processors may be present. Thus while instructions may be discussed as executed by a processor the instructions may be executed simultaneously serially or otherwise executed by one or multiple processors. Instructions codes computer programs scripts and or data that may be accessed from the secondary storage for example hard drives floppy disks optical disks and or other device the ROM and or the RAM may be referred to in some contexts as non transitory instructions and or non transitory information.

In an embodiment the computer system may comprise two or more computers in communication with each other that collaborate to perform a task. For example but not by way of limitation an application may be partitioned in such a way as to permit concurrent and or parallel processing of the instructions of the application. Alternatively the data processed by the application may be partitioned in such a way as to permit concurrent and or parallel processing of different portions of a data set by the two or more computers. In an embodiment virtualization software may be employed by the computer system to provide the functionality of a number of servers that is not directly bound to the number of computers in the computer system . For example virtualization software may provide twenty virtual servers on four physical computers.

In some contexts the secondary storage the ROM and the RAM may be referred to as a non transitory computer readable medium or a computer readable storage media. A dynamic RAM embodiment of the RAM likewise may be referred to as a non transitory computer readable medium in that while the dynamic RAM receives electrical power and is operated in accordance with its design for example during a period of time during which the computer is turned on and operational the dynamic RAM stores information that is written to it. Similarly the processor may comprise an internal RAM an internal ROM a cache memory and or other internal non transitory storage blocks sections or components that may be referred to in some contexts as non transitory computer readable media or computer readable storage media.
