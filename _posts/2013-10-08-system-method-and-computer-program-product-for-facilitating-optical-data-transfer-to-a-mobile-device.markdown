This is a non provisional patent application that claims the benefit of co pending U.S. provisional patent application No. 61 760 927 filed Feb. 5 2013 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present disclosure generally relates to transferring digital data and more particularly to optically transferring digital data between a source and a mobile device.

Mobile telephony has rapidly grown since the introduction of the cell networks in the late twentieth century. As such cell phones have technologically evolved rapidly from large single function devices solely for making and receiving telephone calls and starting in the early 1990 s to smart phones that include multiple functions in addition to functioning as a telephone. A smart phone is a high end mobile phone that offers more advanced computing ability and connectivity than a contemporary mobile phone having a primary purpose as a telephone. Smart phones combine the functions of a personal digital assistant and a mobile phone and today s models typically also serve as portable media players and camera phones with high resolution touch screens GPS navigation Wi Fi connectivity and mobile broadband Internet access. Smartphones now make up an every growing and significant portion of all mobile phones.

Today s smart phones employ one of multiple available operating systems depending on the design of the device and can function as the equivalent of small personal computers. With the incorporation of a dedicated operating system the various developers also offer applications for hosting on the smart phones tablet computers and other portable electronic devices to perform various software functions depending on the desires and needs of the user. The available applications can be platform and developer specific or can be third party applications that are executable using an application programming interface. While software applications for laptop or tower type computers are generally purchased on hard media such as CD s or downloaded from an Internet website for installation on the computer the small size and mobile nature of a smart phone a tablet computer and other portable electronic devices often precludes such means for obtaining and installing applications. Since a smart phone or other small smart devices have input capabilities that are limited or restricted to electronic transfer of files such transfer must typically be accomplished over a subscriber network permitting the transfer of data files.

The dramatic increase in the demand for and the number of applications available for mobile electronic devices has driven the industry to develop alternate methods for a user to acquire data files or applications in lieu of utilizing hard media or through expensive subscriber networks. In the absence or unavailability of such subscriber networks the introduction of applications or the transfer of data files to the smart phone becomes problematic. Therefore a method for transferring digital files by other than an electronic subscriber network is needed.

Accordingly a need remains for a system method and computer program product for optically transferring a digital data file from a computing system to a mobile device that overcomes at least one of the aforementioned shortcomings.

The present disclosure meets the above mentioned needs by providing at least one of a system method and computer program product for facilitating optical data to a mobile device. The present disclosure is generally directed to a system and method that satisfies the need for transferring digital files to a mobile electronic device by other than an electronic subscriber network wherein the mobile electronic device has a video capturing function and further uses an executable application which decodes the data streaming from the device s camera. The transmitting side of the system consists of proprietary encoding hardware connected to a video display unit or a type having a computer and memory storage connected to a video display unit or a pre encoded media format playing within it native hardware connected to a video display unit for displaying a visual representation of a the data for reception by the portable device.

The non limiting exemplary embodiment s will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which a preferred embodiment of the disclosure is shown. Such exemplary embodiment s may however be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiment set forth herein. Rather these embodiment s are provided so that this application will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the true scope of the disclosure to those skilled in the art.

The below disclosed subject matter is to be considered illustrative and not restrictive and any appended claim s are intended to cover all such modifications enhancements and other embodiment s which fall within the true scope of the non limiting exemplary embodiment s . Thus to the maximum extent allowed by law the scope of the non limiting exemplary embodiment s is to be determined by the broadest permissible interpretation of the claim s and their equivalents and shall not be restricted or limited by the foregoing detailed description.

References in the specification to an exemplary embodiment an embodiment a preferred embodiment an alternative embodiment and similar phrases mean that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment s is included in at least an embodiment of the disclosure. The appearances of the phrase a non limiting exemplary embodiment in various places in the specification are not necessarily all meant to refer to the same embodiment.

Referring initially to a non limiting exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure is illustrated as a system for optically transferring a digital data file to a mobile electronic device. System generally includes a computer e.g. computing device having an associated memory unit connected for electronic communication therewith or a microprocessor computer and with its associated memory within a dedicated hardware solution. Computer can be of many forms such as a microprocessor laptop a tower or a server or other such device having a central processing unit CPU operating under an operating system instruction set typically retained in memory unit . Memory unit further has retained therein an instruction set for encoding a digital data file into a plurality of discrete visual elements according to a pattern protocol for embedment into a video signal transmission. See for a more detailed description of an exemplary computing device e.g. computer .

In a non limiting exemplary embodiment computer is electronically communicative with a video transmitter that in turn transmits a video transmission signal to a video display unit . Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that video transmitter may be a subset of the computer hardware or may be a standalone unit or may be an existing video player that is playing its native media with pre encoded data or may be a broadcast video receiver that is transmitting a video broadcast that has be encoded with the transmitted data such as illustrated in and transmits a desired video signal to video display unit utilizing known video protocols to produce a desired video display on a screen of display unit . Video transmission signal can be a hard wired transmission such as over a video cable utilizing known electronic or optical signal transmission protocols or alternatively can be a remote broadcast signal wherein video display unit captures a wireless signal using an antenna not shown . A data display section of screen is reserved for display of the pattern encoded by the protocol of the encoding instruction set.

In a non limiting exemplary embodiment the information presented in the data display section can be controlled by the user through the video encoder server hardware. This includes the number of discrete color levels the size of the window the number size of discrete elements e.g. array of discrete elements the encoded protocol and the like. The presented frequency of images frame rate of the data display section can additionally be established and controlled by the user.

In a non limiting exemplary embodiment the user has a mobile electronic device such as a smart phone for example or another portable electronic device suitable for performing the functions of the present disclosure. Mobile electronic device includes a central processor and memory residing within device and is operating using an operating system and executable decoding application residing in the memory and executed by the central processor. Thus mobile electronic device is merely one example of a computing device e.g. computer capable of performing the functions of the present disclosure. Additionally the mobile electronic device includes a video capture device such as a camera .

In a non limiting exemplary embodiment a user is able to transfer a digital data file or executable application to mobile electronic device . The file transfer process by which the data file e.g. digital data file 

is transferred is illustrated in the flow diagram of . It is noted that the steps described in block through block provide a video server portion of the system. The additional steps identified by block through block describes a mobile device portion of the system. In block the process begins. The digital data file to be transferred can either reside in the memory unit or be uploaded to memory unit in a manner well known in the industry and in block computer reads the digital data file from memory . Exemplary embodiments of memory are illustrated in .

In a non limiting exemplary embodiment in block computer executes the data encoding instruction set. The data file is transformed to its encoded form in the following manner for display on section of display screen . The encoded visual data starts with a box that forms the data display window. For security the encoded file can also include authentication information such as the identification of the computer or server the file s author a security certificate or other identification data known to the industry wherein the user is further given the option to view the authentication information prior to downloading the data file. The first frame of the transfer includes calibration elements which allows the application to store color and luminance calibration information for the entire data display window. A synchronization element is used to notify the application when the next frame of data is available and is used to keep track of the frame number. The remainder of the data file is represented by other elements in subsequent frames that are located within the data display window while the synchronization element is flashed on and off to notify the application when the next series of data elements are available.

In a non limiting exemplary embodiment the data can be streamed in a serial manner using only one data element per frame thus using less visual space of the display and thereby minimizing the size required for data display section of display screen . However by transmitting the digital file in a serial manner the time required for transfer will be greater.

In a non limiting exemplary embodiment the data can be streamed in a parallel manner. Parallel transfer of the file reduces the required transfer time but in return requires a larger sized data display section in display screen . For instance in an eight element parallel transfer there are eight data locations eight element positions within the data display window. In the monochrome operation of this method when a white element is present in a particular position at a given time the bit value is a 1 and if no element is present the bit value is a 0. The resolution can be changed to the user s specification i.e. the number of pixels used to represent an element . Higher resolutions utilize fewer pixels to represent each element and more elements within the data display window on the video display unit .

In a non limiting exemplary embodiment basic encoding of the digital data file is accomplished by displaying white elements on a black background. In such an encoding scheme each element represents one bit of the data file.

In a non limiting exemplary embodiment the unique pattern of discrete visual elements is formatted in black and white.

In a non limiting exemplary embodiment the unique pattern of discrete visual elements is formatted in color.

In a non limiting exemplary embodiment the unique pattern of discrete visual elements is formatted in a dot pattern.

In a non limiting exemplary embodiment the unique pattern of discrete visual elements is has a predetermined geometric shape.

In a non limiting exemplary embodiment more advanced encoding is also possible through the use of colored elements. In this advanced encoding scheme each colored element represents an octal decimal hexadecimal or other numerical system value. For example in a 64 bit per frame parallel transfer arrangement the synch window may have eight data element locations element positions and eight different colors for each element. If there is no element in a location at a given time the data value is 0 otherwise the data value is determined by the element s color. A particular color s numerical value is readily readable as a particular binary combination corresponding to the portion of the data file being transferred by the colored element. The position of the element within the data display window in screen section represents a certain data value and position in the data stream.

In a non limiting exemplary embodiment the system s frame resolution can be changed from serial transfer one bit per element per data display window using only one white element color to theoretically up to the total number of pixels within the data display window times the number of colors used. Practically the resolution of system is limited by the quality of display the distance the user is removed from or away from display and the quality of the video capture function of mobile electronic device .

In a non limiting exemplary embodiment a major part of the process is the codec known as the encoder decoder which uses location and color as the major method of encoding and decoding the data being transmitted. This codec is what will insure high data transfer rates with quality data integrity as well. The encoder uses at least four layers of information to encode and decode the information into the transmitted data elements and extract information from the received data elements location and 3 layers of color information. The data can be encoded and decoded using the RGB color model YUV color model HSV color model or other suitable color models that can be processed with the portable electronics device s operating system. The RGB codec will encode and decode data base on the elements location and red color level green color level and blue color level information within data display. The discrete digitized values of each of these color levels and the location from each element are stored in a byte array then the array is checked for errors and corrected as needed. Once all of the data display frames have been detected and stored any errors in the data are corrected the data is then formatted to recreate the original file and saved into the portable device s nonvolatile memory. Once the file is saved it can be instantly installed if it is an application or it can be opened by other programs if it is some other type of file. The data can also be created similarly with each of the other color models.

In a non limiting exemplary embodiment the level of discrete color values that are used can be adjusted. Less discrete color values will give wider spacing in between colors and further combat errors that may occur. During the color encoding and decoding process the display area will be surrounded by a white border to allow the application to determine where the data display box is. The very first screen shown will indicate the start of the transmission and calibrate the application to decode data from subsequent frames. The location of the color calibration elements will be in a known place in relation to the border and the color calibration elements will be used to compare a current data position s color information with a known standard.

In a non limiting exemplary embodiment the next frame describes the format of the file length of the file format of the element positions and information about the encoding level to be used. The synchronization element will be in known location. It will flash from black to a colored value with the passing of each frame so that the codec will know when a new page of data is available. During decoding the synchronization element will be used to advance to data position counter up. Color calibration elements can also be present during each frame of the transmission because changes in ambient light conditions and other sources of noise may distort the colors from the time the video recording begins and ends. When the lighting conditions change the presence of known color values at on each frame will give a reliable standard to compare to.

In addition to the location and color encoding and decoding method additional redundant data is also added to the original data for the purpose of forward error correction. Gray coding can also be employed to further prevent errors. Interleaving error correction and detection is employed as an easy way to quickly detect and corrected errors that may occur. Block coding methods are used to carry out the error detection and correction using each frame as a separate block. Turbo code or low density parity check code is the coding method of choice since they are both newer constructs and would provide the highest efficiency. However any other FEC coding methods may also be used with this system since these methods are preprocessed before the transmission of the data and post processed after the data is decoded using the color decoding method first.

In a non limiting exemplary embodiment in block the encoded file is uploaded to the video transmitter and in block the uploaded encoded file is embedded in the video transmission stream and then transmitted in block . Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that while the process steps of blocks and are presented as occurring serially one or more of the block functions can be performed in a parallel or near parallel manner as well known in the industry. The video transmission being broadcast or transmitted by video transmitter is captured by video display unit and in block is displayed on video screen with the encoded data file being displayed in a serial or parallel data stream in data display section .

In a non limiting exemplary embodiment computer repeatedly streams the data file over and over again in a continuous manner. In a second embodiment a visual data server or computer accepts inquiries via existing wireless communications technology and protocols and in response to the inquiry visually serves the data file on a one time basis once an authenticated request has been received. This embodiment requires additional hardware encompassing existing wireless communications technology.

In a non limiting exemplary embodiment once the digital data file has been encoded embedded and dynamically displayed on screen of video display unit the encoded file can be captured by mobile electronics device . In block the user of mobile electronics device initiates execution of the custom file transfer application on mobile device thereby activating the video capture function of mobile device . This is usually accomplished by activating the camera function of device . In block the user directs camera of mobile device at video display to capture the streaming video of the digital data file to be transferred. In block device begins capturing streaming video of the encoded digital data file. The data display window border displays the entire time of the transmission and synchronization element flashes at a specified rate in section of screen so that the data frame in section can be located by the video capturing function of mobile electronic device and the data can be synchronized and decoded.

In a non limiting exemplary embodiment in block the file transfer application on device determines whether the transmission box in section has been detected. If the box has not been detected the process returns to block and the cycle repeats until the transmission box has been detected. The application determines the transfer protocol and then accepts the file authentication information from the display for the user to accept or deny. In block the transfer application on device determines whether the starting frame of the file being transferred has been found. If not the process returns to block until the starting frame has been recognized and then proceeds to block .

In a non limiting exemplary embodiment in block the application uses the calibration elements to store known color values for deciphering subsequent data elements. In block the application continues to accept the streamed data as a bit stream for storage in protected memory and in block the application tests for whether the end of the file frame has reached. If not the process proceeds to block and the application continues to store streamed data bytes and returns to block to continue the reading cycle until the end of the file is reached in block . When the end of the file is reached in block the user is queried whether to accept the file. Upon acceptance the process proceeds to block where the saved data stream is decoded and the decoded file is checked for errors corrected if necessary then moved from protected memory to the user s hardware storage media in device . Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the user inquiry and acceptance can be accomplished during capture of the video stream of the data file and prior to acquisition of the complete data file. In block the decoded copy of the data file can be used or if the file is an executable application the application can be installed on mobile device . Upon successful installation of the application in block the data file transfer application terminates in block .

In a non limiting exemplary embodiment the application can run on different layers of the portable device s operating systems. The application can be written in the Java language to run in an Android environment or written in objective C to run in an iOS environment or written in C and C to run in a Linux or Windows environment or written in the native language of any other programming language to run on other high level operating systems. The application can also be written to run on layers lower than a high level operating system to execute faster on the portable device s processor. Please refer to the description of for further explanation.
