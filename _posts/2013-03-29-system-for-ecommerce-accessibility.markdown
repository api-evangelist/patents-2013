The present application relates and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 618 481 filed Mar. 30 2012 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR E COMMERCE ACCESSIBILITY the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.

The present invention relates to a method and a system for conducting an electronic transaction on a network of computers and more particularly to an electronic sales transaction via a network of computers.

A web page or webpage as used herein refers to an electronic document file residing on a computer sometimes referred to as a server in a network of computers that may be accessed by a web browser for the purpose of displaying information including text graphics and the like to a user via an electronic display.

A web site or website refers to a set or a collection of interrelated web pages residing on a computer or a number of computers in a network of computers and accessible by a user via an electronic address typically referred as a uniform resource locator URL or web address.

A browser or web browser refers to a software application for accessing retrieving presenting displaying and traversing information residing on computers in a network of computers including websites web pages weblogs blogs or the like.

Click and its grammatical variations refers to operating a pointing device associated with a computer e.g. a mouse to select an item on the electronic display of the computer which leads to the activation of a command or function which is executed by the computer associated with the display.

E commerce refers to a series of electronically executed steps over a publicly accessible network of computers e.g. Internet that at the very least includes steps for offering a product or a service for sale by a seller or a seller s agent and steps for collection of payment information e.g. credit card information from a buyer.

Electronic publishing page refers to any electronically transmittable computer readable file for the display of content such as text graphics or a combination of text or graphics or the like on an electronic display such a computer monitor including a graphical photographic display advertising unit a textual advertising unit a textual editorial content i.e. blogs a graphical display editorial content i.e. digital banners a dynamic display unit such as video content or animated content a user generated social commentary and or imagery a sponsored paid social commentary and or imagery or a hybrid of any of these.

A conventional method of inducing an e commerce transaction includes offering a product through electronic advertising via a computer network.

A well known method of conducting e commerce includes electronic advertising by displaying a graphic on a webpage of a website that is hyperlinked to another webpage in another website meaning that the another webpage is not in the collection of web pages constituting the website of the web page on which the graphic is displayed . When a user clicks on the graphic the browser associated with the user s computer is directed to the another web page. Once the browser is directed and the browser displays the another web page the user is able to conclude the e commerce transaction i.e. purchase the advertised product .

A method according to the present invention enables an e commerce transaction without redirecting the browser to another webpage where the remainder of the e commerce transaction may be conducted. That is in a method according to the present invention the user s browser is not directed to another web page i.e. a web page associated with another web site and remains directed to the web page while an e commerce transaction is conducted.

In a method according to the present invention once the user selects an information object displayed on a web page to which the browser is directed the e commerce transaction is conducted without redirecting the browser.

An information object may be a moving or a static electronic image and or a textual object e.g. a brand a phrase containing a brand etc. .

A system according to the present invention is an E Commerce technology platform and application that enables seamless E Commerce transactions from any electronic publishing page e.g. a branded Blog a social media web page a website Email etc. .

A system according to the present invention provides access to a Client Application Programming Interface API which can be installed within any electronic publishing page. Once a user accesses the electronic publishing page using a computer and its contents are displayed to the user by a monitor associated with the user s computer the API will enable the user s client s computer to interface with a system according to the present invention so that the two systems can communicate with one another. Once the API is captured from a system according to the present invention and installed E commerce transactions may be conducted without redirecting the web browser to another web page of another web site thereby adding E commerce functionality directly to the electronic publishing page itself.

Thus for example as a user reads the content of an electronic publishing page i.e. Blog article the user can click an information object which will lead to the display of an information window. The information window may include a plurality of product information sections each section providing information regarding a product and at least one action button associated with the product in the information section. The action button can be configured to lead the user through the steps that will conclude an E commerce transaction.

The steps leading to the E commerce transaction may include a registration step either directly or through a third party web site where the user is already registered e.g. Facebook Connect etc. .

Once a user is registered the user may interact with the system to conduct an E commerce transaction from any electronic publishing page that includes an information object.

A system according to the present invention can be implemented with any electronic publishing platform including electronic social networking services blogs web sites Email etc.

Each information section may also display an action button which when clicked by the user enables the sharing of the information in the associated information section with members of the user s network in a number of convenient ways via email social networks etc. . The members of the user s network will then also be able to conduct an E commerce transaction in the same manner as the user.

Sellers of products can use a system according to the present invention to configure customize information windows displayed to the users and direct the system to add E commerce capability to designated electronic publishing pages.

Furthermore a system according to the present invention can provide the following reports to a registered seller 

3. How many people shared information regarding the seller s content and where the information was shared

4. Referrers A referrer is an electronic publishing page e.g. a web page at which at least the E commerce transaction which is concluded by or at least through a system according to the present invention was initiated without the browser being directed to another electronic publishing page. 5. Demo and lifestyle information This information is demographic and lifestyle information from consumers users captured and stored in a database by a system according to the present invention. Examples include spending tiers content type category type and any demographic lifestyle information age sex product interests etc. and other information that can be appended through other databases.

A user potential buyer experiences the following when interacting with a system according to the present invention 

1 On a particular web page the user clicks on the information object and the system auto detects if the user is a registered user.

2 If so an information display window will be displayed to the user that displays one product information section or a plurality of information sections each displaying information regarding a respective product. Each information section provides the user with an option to add the product to a virtual shopping bag and or to share the information regarding the product in that information section with the user s network via for example an electronic social networking service. 3 Once the user s selection is placed in the virtual shopping bag optionally other items are displayed to induce another sale upselling . 4 Once the user confirms the intent to conclude the purchase an additional discount to the purchase price or a free sample may be offered to the user if the user agrees to share information relating to the product through an electronic social networking service. 5 Thereafter payment information is collected from the user and processed by the system to conclude the E Commerce transaction. A receipt may be then emailed. 6 For a new user personal information credit card and shipping information are obtained after the user has directed the placement of a selected product in the virtual shopping bag. 7 A user may check out as a guess without registration with the system. Only credit card and shipping information are obtained in this case. 8 A discount may be applied to new users upon confirmation of the purchase.

A seller of a product may experience the following when using a system according to the present invention 

1 A new seller may first register with a system according to the present invention through a website associated with the system. To register the seller provides to the system preferably via the website its name gateway information and account information. 2 The company s profile will be customized with its brand identity meaning that the creative copy and other branding elements will be incorporated into the design of the page templates and rendered displayable within the information displays sequentially displayed to the user during the E commerce transaction. 3 The seller will then be able to populate the system with seller s product information. The seller can choose various templates for presenting the product information in an information display window and may designate which template is used for which electronic publishing page. 4 The system then associates each template customized with the seller s products with the designated electronic publishing pages designated by the seller.

Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the invention which refers to the accompanying drawings.

A system according to the present invention includes a central processing center CPC which is one computer server or a plurality of interconnected computers servers configured to provide the necessary computer executable instructions computer executable code and information to a user s computer or a seller s computer to realize the functionalities described herein. The CPC in a system according to the present invention is also configured to retain and process information received from a user s computer or a seller s computer.

A system according to the present invention will include a CPC that can be selectively connected to communicate with user computers seller computers and computers hosting electronic publishing pages via for example a publicly accessible computer network such as the Internet.

Product display window may include one information section or a plurality of information sections . Each information section may display information relating to a product for example the name of the product a description of the product and its price.

Each information section may further include one action button or a plurality of action buttons. Each action button when clicked sends a command to the user computer that is associated with the display on which web page is displayed to cause the computer to perform a function e.g. execute a set of computer executable codes .

Action button in each information section enables the user to add the selected product to a virtual shopping bag as is well known in the field. Thus when the user clicks action button in one information section the user s computer executes a series of codes that leads to the addition of the product described in that information section to a virtual shopping bag.

Action button in each information section enables the user to share the information pertaining to the product listed in the information section with a group of users through an electronic social networking service e.g. Facebook as is well known in the field. Thus when the user clicks action button in an information section the user s computer executes a series of codes leading to the display of information relating to the product described in that information section to a web page of an electronic social networking service.

Window may further include an advertising section that can be used for displaying advertising graphic or the like.

In a preferred embodiment the clicking of information object triggers a coded AJAX script that launches window . Window may be a javascript generated ModalBox powered by a javascript framework. The product information sections may be dynamically generated based on the instructions present in the AJAX script.

Action button may also be an AJAX script that calls a list of electronic social networking services and bookmarking services through which the user can share pertinent information on the user s social or bookmarking accounts.

Advertising section may call GIF PNG or other compatible banner advertisements from advertising distribution servers. These will be periodically refreshed.

In the embodiment shown in the information object is available to the user within the section designated of web page for the display of content e.g. text .

Referring to in a second embodiment information object can be provided in association with a web banner e.g. a graphic displayed along with the content of the web page.

Upon clicking information object window as shown in is displayed by the browser for the user to view. Note that web page remains displayed in the background behind window since the browser is not redirected to another web page.

According to an aspect of the present invention the computer associated with the user s display generates window for display by the browser based on a series of computer executable codes CEC which have been configured and customized by the seller of the product. The CEC may be sent to the user s computer from the CPC when information object is clicked and executed by the user s computer or the CEC may reside on a different computer and executed by a computer other than the user s computer. The execution of the CEC enables at least communication between the CPC and the user s computer. While in communication the CPC and the user s computer may exchange computer executable instructions and information. The information supplied to and received by the CPC may be provided by the user via one or more graphic user interfaces which are generated based on code supplied by the CPC and displayed by the browser residing on the user s computer.

Note that information object can be customized for any type of advertising banner. A SWF banner will contain an ActionScript button that calls ActionScript programming to generate a call to action to start the process namely to generate the windows e.g. pop up windows and fillable forms for conducting the transactions e.g. E Commerce transactions registration etc. whereas GIF PNG JPG banners call an appropriate JavaScript function to do the same as the SWF banner as described herein. Mobile compliant ad servers can substitute SWF banners when available so that information relating to the products can be viewed on non Flash supporting mobile devices. The information object may also be accessed from within web banners.

Referring now to once action button is clicked by the user a first electronically fillable form is generated and displayed for the user by the user s browser. Form includes a plurality of virtual buttons each associated with an electronic social networking service. The user may select one electronic social networking service or two or more such services. The selection leads to the transmission of information related to the product associated with the display section that is also associated with the clicked action button to the selected social networking service.

For example as shown in information relating to the item in information section is then displayed on a web page of a selected electronic social networking service in this case web page available through a well known service called Facebook.

Optionally information regarding the product can also be shared on other people s walls or tagged to specific people. Sharing depending on the social networking services API can either occur within the same page or within a different browser tab or window. The shared information will then be displayed on the social networking services web site which will open in a new tab or window.

Sharing is preferably handled by an API connected to a portal that lists available social networks and bookmarking services for media distribution. The user will have to be logged into his preferred networks or will be prompted to log in before sharing.

Referring now to window further displays action button . When action button is clicked by the user a first e commerce window is generated to display products placed in the virtual shopping bag.

Before any information is processed from the generated shopping bag listing AJAX frontend script to the CPC backend it undergoes an encryption process that securely transmits information such as the User ID product list prices and other relevant information to the CPC where it is decoded. The clicking of action button stores a script within the user s browser cookies remembering items marked quantities cost and other relevant information. This script clears this information once the session is closed either by javascript function or when the browser is terminated. Products in the virtual Shopping bag are preferably described in terms of name appearance thumbnail preferred size if applicable quantity and price. An additional action button is also provided in window .

Window includes a check out button which when clicked by the user generates and displays a second e commerce window as shown in . Second e commerce window preferably allows the user to make one of three selections. Specifically the user may select to further proceed with the e commerce transaction as a returning customer i.e. a customer that has registered with the CPC a new customer wishing to be registered with the CPC or a customer who wishes to continue without registering with the CPC a guest .

A guest can checkout without registering. The details of the transaction will not be stored in the CPC.

A system according to the present invention recognizes a registered user and generates a script based on the user s login credentials which is then sent to the CPC securely for processing. A cookie is generated which will be available for the remainder of the user s session.

Upon selection of one of the options by the user a third e commerce window is generated and displayed as shown in . Third e commerce window is an electronically fillable form that allows the user to enter his her shipping address telephone number etc. The information so entered is then received by the CPC. Third e commerce window displays action button . Upon clicking action button another e commerce window is generated and displayed to collect payment information from the user. The payment information is then sent to and received by the CPC for payment processing to conclude the e commerce transaction. A notification that includes a receipt for the transaction may be then optionally sent to the user electronically e.g. via e mail .

In the preferred embodiment the electronic fillable forms are AJAX generated and are transmitted using a similar security algorithm used in conjunction with the virtual shopping bag uses. Form fields may be validated both using client side and server side scripts.

Referring back to if the user selects to register as a new user as part of the registration process the user may be enabled to send out electronic invitations to other users. illustrates an electronically fillable form that includes fillable field in which the user may enter his her name a fillable field in which the user can enter e mail addresses of the invitees and a fillable field in which the user can enter a short message directed at the invitees.

Preferably an SSL enabled mailserver handles the distribution of email invitations compliant with SpamAssassin and other anti spam standards.

Referring now to as an alternative a new user may register through another registered account from a service provided by a third party web site e.g. an electronic social networking service other than a web site associated with the CPC. Thus a window may be optionally provided to the user that includes a plurality of action buttons each associated with a third party social networking service with which the user has registered. By clicking any one of action buttons the user s registration information is obtained from the third party social networking service. Thereafter a registration window is generated and displayed see and each field in registration window is populated with the appropriate registration information obtained from the third party social networking service.

APIs for various third party social accounts will receive security tokens enabling interaction between the CPC and the third party network. A regular form submission process secure encrypted is also available. Newsletter requests will be handled by the system s mailserver for processing.

Note that as is well known in the field the information provided by the user is validated at user s computer and at the CPC and or the user is directed to populate each field that is empty after the registration information is obtained from the third party social networking service.

Referring to optionally a confirmation window may be generated and displayed to the user by the user s browser that includes an undo action button . By clicking undo action button the user can undo the registration in which case the CPC will delete the user s registration information.

Preferably any action that aborts a process closes a window terminates the browser session or otherwise discontinues the process of interacting with the system will trigger a cleanup script that clears all browser cookies generated by the system.

As is readily seen the user interacts with the CPC to conclude an e commerce transaction and conduct other transactions without the user s web browser being directed to another web page.

A system according to the present invention enables a seller of each product displayed in a window to configure a CEC to generate at least the code necessary for display of window with the seller s product s by a user s web browser.

A system according to the present invention further enables a seller to designate a third party web site that will be displaying information object on at least one of its web pages the activation of which through clicking leads to an e commerce transaction without leaving that web page of the third party web site.

In a system according to the present invention each information section is populated with information provided by a merchant seller to the CPC. To provide product information to the CPC a seller can set up an account with the CPC by first registering as a seller.

Once registered a user can upload to the CPC information relating to a product or a number of products. The information so provided will be used by the CPC to enable the display of information window see e.g. by a browser.

By clicking on Manage Product action button a registered seller may edit the information related to the seller s product s through a number of customization web pages available from a web site associated with the CPC to a registered seller.

A register Seller can access a full list of products and manage the information of one product or multiple products.

While code snippets may be provided by the user the CPC may parse information from a WYSIWYG editor that generates the code according to the user s instructions.

This page also includes a size selection section that allows the registered user to select a size for a displayable feature for example the size of information object or the registered seller s logo or brand.

The customization web page shown in further includes an action button the clicking of which will allow the registered seller to upload an image file e.g. an image file for displaying the registered seller s logo . A window is provided for the preview of the uploaded image file branding mark .

A registered seller can obtain information regarding the sale of its products from the CPC. illustrates an example of a report which can be generated by the CPC and accessed by a registered seller.

The information may include an analysis of buttons clickthrough rate with color codes assigned to specific countries or Internet locations.

It should be noted that each action button contains tracking scripts which then sends analytical information to the CPC. The information is then translated into visual graphs through AJAX functions.

If the user clicks action button then the product is added to the virtual shopping bag S. Optionally at S user may be able to add multiple items to the virtual shopping bag. To enable this option many items may be displayed with a check box associated with each item so that more than one item may be selected by the user before the next step. At this point or after the user clicks action button See the CPC cause the display of additional information relating to other products in order to induce an additional e commerce sale transaction S confirms that the user would like to proceed to conclude the e commerce transaction S if the user has not clicked action button associated with the product described in information section offer discount or the like as an incentive to induce the user to click action button S and then proceeds to conclude the e commerce transaction by filing the user s personal information shipping address etc. payment information and payment processing S. A confirmation notification in the form of an e mail may be then sent to the user S.

If the central processing unit determines that the user is unregistered steps S S S are repeated. At step S optionally a new customer discount S is offered to the user to induce the user to register as a customer. If the discount is accepted the user follows a registration process as described above. If declined the e commerce transaction is concluded S by taking the user s personal information the user s payment information and payment processing.

At step S the user may elect to register through a third party registration see and associated description . If the user makes such an election the instruction to obtain registration information from a third party is received by the CPC S and the user registration form is automatically filled out S. Thereafter a shipping address for the user S and the user s payment information S are obtained from the user. Thereafter the user is offered the option to confirm the registration S. If confirmed e commerce transaction is concluded S. If declined the registration process is reversed S. Once the e commerce transaction is concluded a notification e.g. an e mail that may include a receipt is sent to the user S.

Thereafter the new seller becomes registered and as a registered seller may set up an inventory of products S configure a template for one product or a group of products S and select the cosmetic aspects of window display S. Thereafter based on the seller s selections the CPC generates the CEC S.

The registered seller may have the option of setting up more product templates S in which case the system directs the seller back to S. If the seller selects not to devise more templates the seller selects distribution channels S designates websites or other electronic publishing pages which will be authorized to receive the CEC to enable an e commerce transaction according to the present invention S and assign a different template to each one of the selected websites S.

It should be noted that all information supplied to and taken from the user s computer passes through CPC .

CMS further includes a server or a plurality of servers that function to perform fulfillment services . Fulfillment services would include post sale services such as e mails or the like notifications regarding shipping of the item tracking of the item while en route and other electronic notifications and communications such as communications relating to returns or the like. In addition CMS would include a server or a plurality of servers that process payments to the seller after e commerce transactions are concluded.

A registered Seller utilizes CPC to create and generate action buttons which are then populated into a website embedded into a banner or associated with any other electronic publishing page.

Thus in one embodiment the E commerce transaction is processed as a standalone e commerce system in which seller product information resides solely on the system s CPC .

In another embodiment the seller s existing database s can be synchronized with CPC and the payment gateway of a system according to the present invention in order to securely transact and accomplish a purchase through the system.

A payment gateway provides an additional layer of security which is particularly important since a method according to the present invention involves purchase of products and transaction of payment information outside of an actual e commerce environment e.g. through an AJAX window of another website.

Although the present invention has been described in relation to particular embodiments thereof many other variations and modifications and other uses will become apparent to those skilled in the art. It is preferred therefore that the present invention be limited not by the specific disclosure herein but only by the appended claims.
